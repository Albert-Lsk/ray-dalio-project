Changing world order by ray dalio
Ray Dalio is a renowned figure as the Founder, Co-CIO, and Member of the Bridgewater Board, having led the largest and best-performing hedge fund in the world over the last forty years. He has been featured on influential lists such as Time 100 and Bloomberg Markets, and is also the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Principles and its
subsequent books. Dalio resides with his family in Connecticut. Dalio's work has had a significant impact on the business world, with his book Principles being hailed as a "provocative read" by The New York Times. The book offers practical advice on navigating changing economic and political conditions, drawing from Dalio's extensive study of global
economies and markets over half a century. In recent years, Dalio has identified significant trends, including rising debt levels, near-zero interest rates, and growing wealth disparities in the US, which he believes signal a potentially radical shift in the world order. Dalio's book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order aims to provide
readers with a deeper understanding of these changes and how to navigate them effectively. By analyzing major empires throughout history, including the Dutch, Dalio seeks to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships that drive economic and political shifts. This book by Ray Dalio explores the cycles that have shaped major countries'
successes and failures throughout history, offering insights into what's to come. He identifies key principles for navigating these shifts and presents a comprehensive look at how economies, cultures, and societies rise and fall. The author's unique approach provides a guide for positioning oneself in an ever-changing world. Notable experts such as
Henry Kissinger, Graham Allison, and Arianna Huffington praise Dalio's audacious yet practical analysis of the past to inform our understanding of current global challenges. Through his work, Ray Dalio aims to help readers learn from history to avoid repeating its mistakes and better prepare for the future. Ray Dalio, the author of several influential
books, is a renowned figure in his field. His most recent publication, "The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail", was released in 2021. In this book, Dalio argues that nation success relies heavily on cycles, similar to business cycles, and that it's not inevitable for a country to exist forever. He believes the key factor in a nation's
success lies in their investment in education. The book spans five centuries of history, covering a wide range of topics.

Principles
by Ray Dalio

What follows are three distinct parts that can be read either independently or as a connected whole. Part
1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having nothing to do with mine.
Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to everything I do. Part 3, explains my
management principles as they are being lived out at Bridgewater. Since my management principles are
simply my most fundamental life principles applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better
understand Part 3, but it’s not required—you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management
principles are and how Bridgewater has been run. One day I’d like to write a Part 4 on my investment
principles. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck (i.e., understanding for the effort), I
suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 (through the Summary and Table of
Principles) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It’s only about 55 pages of a normal size book.
Above all else, I want you to think for yourself—to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true and 3) what to
do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed thoughtful way, so that you get what you want. I wrote
this book to help you do that. I am going to ask only two things of you—1) that you be open-minded and
2) that you honestly answer some questions about what you want, what is true and what you want to do
about it. If you do these things, I believe that you will get a lot out of this book. If you can’t do these
things, you should reflect on why that is, because you probably have discovered one of your greatest
impediments to getting what you want out of life.

Introduction

Introduction
Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from
narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to
achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature
or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact
with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of them or know them less well. Different
principles apply to different aspects of life—e.g., there are “skiing principles” for skiing, “parenting
principles” for parenting, “management principles” for managing, “investment principles” for investing,
etc—and there are over-arching “life principles” that influence our approaches to all things. And, of
course, different people subscribe to different principles that they believe work best.
I am confident that whatever success Bridgewater and I have had has resulted from our operating by
certain principles. Creating a great culture, finding the right people, managing them to do great things and
solving problems creatively and systematically are challenges faced by all organizations. What
differentiates them is how they approach these challenges. The principles laid out in the pages that follow
convey our unique ways of doing these things, which are the reasons for our unique results.
Bridgewater’s success has resulted from talented people operating by the principles set out here, and it
will continue if these or other talented people continue to operate by them. Like getting fit, virtually anyone
can do it if they are willing to do what it takes.
What is written here is just my understanding of what it takes: my most fundamental life principles, my
approach to getting what I want, and my “management principles,” which are based on those foundations.
Taken together, these principles are meant to paint a picture of a process for the systematic pursuit of
truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit. I put them in writing for people to
consider in order to help Bridgewater and the people I care about most.
Until recently, I didn’t write out these principles because I felt that it was presumptuous for me to tell
others what would work best for them. But over time, I saw the people who I cared about most struggling
with problems and wanted to help them; I also found that their problems were almost always the result of
violating one or more of these principles, and that their problems could be solved by applying these
principles. So I began writing down the types of problems and the broken principles that caused them.
When I began, I didn’t know how many principles I would end up with but, through this process, I
discovered that about 200 principles pretty much cover all the problems. 1 I’m sure that I will come up with
more as I learn more.
When I say that these are my principles, I don’t mean that in a possessive or egotistical way. I just mean
that they are explanations of what I personally believe. I believe that the people I work with and care
about must think for themselves. I set these principles out and explained the logic behind them so that we
can together explore their merits and stress test them. While I am confident that these principles work well
because I have thought hard about them, they have worked well for me for many years, and they have
stood up to the scrutiny of the hundreds of smart, skeptical people, I also believe that nothing is certain. I
believe that the best we can hope for is highly probable. By putting them out there and stress testing
them, the probabilities of their being right will increase.

1

Since I learned these principles by encountering reality and reflecting on my encounters, and I am still doing these things, I expect
there are more principles to come. So I am still creating this document by throwing various thoughts down when they occur to me,
trying to put them in some sensible order and trying to smooth over the bumps. Organizing these principles into a sensible order is
a challenge since they relate to each other more like a matrix than as a sequence. To help guide you, I’ve tried to organize them
around large themes like building a great culture, managing people well, and creative problem-solving. I will continue these things,
so this is an evolving document.

Introduction
I also believe that those principles that are most valuable to each of us come from our own encounters
with reality and our reflections on these encounters – not from being taught and simply accepting
someone else’s principles. So, I put these out there for you to reflect on when you are encountering your
realities, and not for you to blindly follow. What I hope for most is that you and others will carefully
consider them and try operating by them as part of your process for discovering what works best for you.
Through this exploration, and with their increased usage, not only will they be understood, but they will
evolve from “Ray’s principles” to “our principles,” and Ray will fade out of the picture in much the same
way as memories of one’s ski or tennis instructor fade and people only pay attention to what works. 2 So,
when digesting each principle, please…

…ask yourself: “Is it true?”
Before I discuss the management principles themselves, it’s important for me to articulate my own most
fundamental life principles because my management principles are an extension of them.
In Part 1, I explain what I mean by principles, why I believe they are important, and how they are essential
for getting what you want out of life.
Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles. I describe what I believe are the best ways of
interacting with reality to learn what it’s like, and how to most effectively deal with it to get what you want.
I also discuss what I believe are the most common traps that people fall into that prevent them from
getting what they want, and how people’s lives can be radically better by avoiding them. I wrote this so
you can better understand why my other principles are what they are, though you don’t need to read this
part to understand the others.
Part 3 is about my management principles. As I have run Bridgewater for more than 35 years, it explains
Bridgewater’s approach up till now. It begins at the big-picture, conceptual level, with an explanation of
why I believe that any company’s results are primarily determined by its people and its culture. It then
drills down into what I believe are the important principles behind creating a great culture, hiring the right
people, managing them to achieve excellence, solving problems systematically and making good
decisions.
There are of course lots of other types of principles. For example, I hope to one day write about my
investment principles. However, management principles are now what we need most, so here are the
ones that I think make sense and have worked for me.

2

While this particular document will always express just what I believe, others will certainly have their own principles, and possibly
even their own principles documents, and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own ways to determine what principles
Bridgewater will operate by. At most, this will remain as one reference of principles for people to consider when they are deciding
what’s important and how to behave.

Part 1: The Importance of Principles

Part 1: The Importance of Principles
I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that
to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles. 3 That is why I believe we need
to talk about them.
We will begin by examining the following questions:
What are principles?
Why are principles important?
Where do principles come from?
Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?
How well do you think they will work, and why?
Answer all questions with complete honesty, without worrying what I or others might think. That honesty
will allow you to be comfortable living with your own principles, and to judge yourself by how consistently
you operate by them. If you don’t have many well-thought-out principles, don’t worry. We will get there
together, if we remain open-minded.

1) What are principles?
Your values are what you consider important, literally what you “value.” Principles are what allow
you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they
are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is
to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices.

2) Why are principles important?
All successful people operate by principles that help them be successful. Without principles, you
would be forced to react to circumstances that come at you without considering what you value
most and how to make choices to get what you want. This would prevent you from making the
most of your life. While operating without principles is bad for individuals, it is even worse for
groups of individuals (such as companies) because it leads to people randomly bumping into
each other without understanding their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent
with those values.

3) Where do principles come from?
Sometimes we forge our own principles and sometimes we accept others’ principles, or holistic
packages of principles, such as religion and legal systems. While it isn’t necessarily a bad thing to
use others’ principles—it’s difficult to come up with your own, and often much wisdom has gone
into those already created—adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought
exposes you to the risk of inconsistency with your true values. Holding incompatible
principles can lead to conflict between values and actions—like the hypocrite who has claims to
be of a religion yet behaves counter to its teachings. Your principles need to reflect values you
really believe in.

3

I wish everyone wrote down their principles. I wish I could read and compare the principles of all the people I’m interested in—
Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, people running for political office, people I share my life with, etc. I'd love to know what they value most
and what principles they use to get what they want. Imagine how great that would be—e.g. imagine how much valuable
fundamental thinking could be harnessed. I hope that my doing this will encourage others to do the same.

Part 1: The Importance of Principles

4) Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?
Your principles will determine your standards of behavior. When you enter into relationships with
other people, your and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared
values and principles get along. People who don’t will suffer through constant misunderstandings
and conflict with one another. Too often in relationships, people’s principles are unclear. Think
about the people with whom you are closest. Are their values aligned with yours?
What do you value most deeply?

5) How well do you think they will work, and why?
Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on
those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves
difficult questions. For example, when our representatives in Washington are investigating
whether various segments of society are behaving ethically, they are simultaneously grappling
with questions such as, “Should the government punish people for bad ethics, or should it just
write and enforce the laws?” Questions of this kind—in this case, about the nature of
government—prompt thoughtful assessments of alternative approaches. These assessments in
turn lead to principles that can be applied to similar occasions in the future. As another example,
“I won’t steal” can be a principle to which you refer when the choice of whether or not to steal
arises. But to be most effective, each principle must be consistent with your values, and this
consistency demands that you ask: Why? Is the reason you won’t steal because you feel
empathy for your potential victim? Is it because you fear getting caught? By asking such
questions, we refine our understanding, and the development of our principles becomes better
aligned with our core values. To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You must
be able to “cut off a leg to save a life,” both on an individual level and, if you lead people, on a
group level. And to be a great leader, it is important to remember that you will have to make these
choices by understanding and caring for your people, not by following them.
You have to answer these questions for yourself. What I hope for most is that you will carefully consider
the principles we will be exploring in this document and try operating by them, as part of the process of
discovering what works best for you. In time, the answers to these questions will evolve from “Ray’s
principles” to “my principles,” and “Ray” will fade from the picture in much the same way as memories of
your ski instructor or basketball coach fade after you have mastered the sport.
So, as I believe that adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought is risky, I am asking you to
join me in thoughtfully discussing the principles that guide how we act. When considering each principle,
please ask yourself, “Is it true?” While this particular document will always express just what I believe,
other people will certainly have their own principles, and possibly even their own principles documents,
and future managers of Bridgewater will work in their own ways to determine what principles Bridgewater
will operate by. At most, this will remain as one reference of principles for people to consider when they
are deciding what’s important and how to behave.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life
Principles
Time is like a river that will take you forward into encounters with reality that will require you to make
decisions. You can’t stop the movement down this river, and you can’t avoid the encounters. You can
only approach these encounters in the best way possible.
That is what this part is all about.

Where I’m Coming From
Since we are all products of our genes and our environments and approach the world with biases, I think
it is relevant for me to tell you a bit of my background so that you can know where I’m coming from.
I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island, the only son of a jazz musician and a stay-athome mom. I was a very ordinary kid, and a less-than-ordinary student. I liked playing with my friends—
for example, touch football in the street—and I didn't like the school part of school, partly because I had,
and still have, a bad rote memory 4 and partly because I couldn’t get excited about forcing myself to
remember what others wanted me to remember without understanding what all this work was going to get
me. In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to
do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not
remember the facts I was being told to remember.
One thing I wanted was spending money. So I had a newspaper route, I mowed lawns, I shoveled the
snow off driveways, I washed dishes in a restaurant, and, starting when I was 12 years old, I caddied.
It was the 1960s. At the time the stock market was booming and everyone was talking about it, especially
the people I caddied for. So I started to invest. The first stock I bought was a company called Northeast
Airlines, and the only reason I bought it was that it was the only company I had heard of that was trading
for less than $5 per share, so I could buy more shares, which I figured was a good thing. It went up a lot.
It was about to go broke but another company acquired it, so it tripled. I made money because I was
lucky, though I didn’t see it that way then. I figured that this game was easy. After all, with thousands of
companies listed in the newspaper, how difficult could it be to find at least one that would go up? By
comparison to my other jobs, this way of making money seemed much more fun, a lot easier, and much
more lucrative. Of course, it didn’t take me long to lose money in the markets and learn about how difficult
it is to be right and the costs of being wrong.
So what I really wanted to do now was beat the market. I just had to figure out how to do it.
The pursuit of this goal taught me:
1) It isn't easy for me to be confident that my opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a
huge amount of work and still be wrong.

4

Rote memory is memory for things that don’t have an intrinsic logic for being what they are, like a random series of numbers,
words in a foreign language and people’s names (all of which I have trouble with). On the other hand, I have a great memory for
things that make sense in a context. For example, I can tell you what happened in every year in the economy and markets since the
mid-1960s and how many things work.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
2) Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there’s no cost to
them. Not so in the market. This is why I have learned to be cautious. No matter how hard I work,
I really can’t be sure.
3) The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money,
you have to be right when they’re wrong.
So …
...1) I worked for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do. For that reason, I never felt
that I had to do anything. All the work I ever did was just what I needed to do to get what I
wanted. Since I always had the prerogative to not strive for what I wanted, I never felt forced to do
anything.
...2) I came up with the best independent opinions I could muster to get what I wanted. For
example, when I wanted to make money in the markets, I knew that I had to learn about
companies to assess the attractiveness of their stocks. At the time, Fortune magazine had a little
tear-out coupon that you could mail in to get the annual reports of any companies on the Fortune
500, for free. So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the most interesting
ones and formed opinions 5 about which companies were exciting.
...3) I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so
I could find out where I was wrong. 6 I never cared much about others’ conclusions—only for
the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through
this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.
...4) I remained wary about being overconfident, and I figured out how to effectively deal with
my not knowing. I dealt with my not knowing by either continuing to gather information until I
reached the point that I could be confident or by eliminating my exposure to the risks of not
knowing. 7
...5) I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned
and improved from this process.
By doing these things, I learned how important and how liberating it is to think for myself.
In a nutshell, this is the whole approach that I believe will work best for you—the best summary of what I
want the people who are working with me to do in order to accomplish great things. I want you to work
for yourself, to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being
overconfident, and to reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.
After I graduated from high school, I went to a local college that I barely got in to. I loved it, unlike high
school, because I could learn about things that interested me; I studied because I enjoyed it, not because
I had to.

5

The way I learn is to immerse myself in something, which prompts questions, which I answer, prompting more questions, until I
reach a conclusion.
6
This included my retail stockbroker, the people I was caddying for, even my local barber, who was equally engrossed in the stock
market. (It wasn’t as precocious as it sounds. At the time, instead of talking about the Yankees, everyone was talking about stocks.
That was the world I grew up in.)
7
Sometimes when I know that I don’t know which way the coin is going to flip, I try to position myself so that it won’t have an impact
on me either way. In other words, I don’t make an inadvertent bet. I try to limit my bets to the limited number of things I am confident
in.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
At that time the Beatles had made a trip to India to learn how to meditate, which triggered my interest, so I
learned how to meditate. It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I’m sure that enhanced my
enjoyment of, and success at, learning. 8 Unlike in high school, in college I did very well.
And of course I continued to trade markets. Around this time I became interested in trading commodities
futures, though virtually nobody traded them back then. I was attracted to trading them just because they
had low margin requirements so I figured I could make more money by being right (which I planned to
be).
By the time I graduated college, in 1971, I had been admitted to Harvard Business School, where I would
go in the fall. That summer between college and HBS I clerked on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange. This was the summer of the breakdown of the global monetary system (i.e., the Bretton
Woods system). It was one of the most dramatic economic events ever and I was at the epicenter of it, so
it thrilled me. It was a currency crisis that drove all market behaviors, so I delved into understanding the
currency markets. The currency markets would be important to me for the rest of my life.
That fall I went to Harvard Business School, which I was excited about because I felt that I had climbed to
the top and would be with the best of the best. Despite these high expectations, the place was even
better than I expected because the case study method allowed open-ended figuring things out and
debating with others to get at the best answers, rather than memorizing facts. I loved the work-hard, playhard environment.
In the summer between my two years at HBS, I pursued my interest in trading commodities futures by
convincing the Director of Commodities for Merrill Lynch to give me a job as his assistant. At the time,
commodities trading was still an obscure thing to do.
In the fall I went back to HBS, and in that academic year, 1972-73, trading commodities futures became a
hot thing to do. That is because the monetary system’s breakdown that occurred in 1971 led to an
inflationary surge that sent commodity prices higher. As a result of this, the first oil shock occurred in
1973. As inflation started to surge, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy to fight it, so stocks
went down in the worst bear market since the Great Depression. So, commodities futures trading was hot
and stock market investing was not. Naturally, brokerage houses that didn’t have commodities trading
departments wanted them, and there was a shortage of people who knew anything about it. Virtually
nobody in the commodities futures business had the type of Harvard Business School background that I
had. So I was hired as Director of Commodities at a moderate-size brokerage and given an old salt who
had lots of commodities brokerage experience to help me set up a commodities division. The bad stock
market environment ended up taking this brokerage house down before we could get the commodities
futures trading going. I went to a bigger, more successful brokerage, where I was in charge of its
institutional/hedging business. But I didn’t fit into the organization well, so I was fired essentially for
insubordination.
So in 1975, after a quick two-year stint on Wall Street after school, I started Bridgewater. Soon after, I got
married and began my family.
Through this time and till now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to
beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2)
coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stresstesting my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out
where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5)
wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to
produce them so that I could improve.

By the way, I still meditate and I still find it helpful.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
Since I started Bridgewater, I have gained a lot more experience that taught me a lot more, mostly by
making mistakes and learning from them. Most importantly:
I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the
realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully
dealing with all my realities.
I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people
think is bad—like mistakes and personal weaknesses—is good because I can then deal with
these things so that they don’t stand in my way.
I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary—for example,
finding out that you have a deadly disease—knowing them allows us to deal with them better.
Being truthful, and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our
thoughts and exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.
I learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me. I believe that people who
are one way on the inside and believe that they need to be another way outside to please others
become conflicted and often lose touch with what they really think and feel. It’s difficult for them to
be happy and almost impossible for them to be at their best. I know that’s true for me.
I learned that I want the people I deal with to say what they really believe and to listen to what
others say in reply, in order to find out what is true. I learned that one of the greatest sources of
problems in our society arises from people having loads of wrong theories in their heads—often
theories that are critical of others—that they won’t test by speaking to the relevant people about
them. Instead, they talk behind people’s backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I learned
to hate this because I could see that making judgments about people so that they are tried and
sentenced in your head, without asking them for their perspective, is both unethical and
unproductive. 9 So I learned to love real integrity (saying the same things as one believes) 10 and to
despise the lack of it. 11
I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important
things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an
incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I
could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I
learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were)
doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. I
learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that
strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those
around me appreciate our successes. 12

9

It is unethical because a basic principle of justice is that everyone has the right to face his accuser. And it is unproductive because
it does not lead to the exploration of “Is it true?” which can lead to understanding and improvement.
10
I do not mean that you should say everything you think, just that what you do say matches your thoughts.
11
The word “integrity” is from the Latin root “integer,” which means “one” i.e., that you are the same inside and out. Most people
would be insulted if you told them that they don't have integrity—but how many people do you know who tell people what they really
think?
12
I believe that our society's “mistakephobia” is crippling, a problem that begins in most elementary schools, where we learn to learn
what we are taught rather than to form our own goals and to figure out how to achieve them. We are fed with facts and tested and
those who make the fewest mistakes are considered to be the smart ones, so we learn that it is embarrassing to not know and to
make mistakes. Our education system spends virtually no time on how to learn from mistakes, yet this is critical to real learning. As
a result, school typically doesn’t prepare young people for real life—unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing
others. In my opinion, that’s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
I learned that the popular picture of success—which is like a glossy photo of an ideal man or
woman out of a Ralph Lauren catalog, with a bio attached listing all of their accomplishments like
going to the best prep schools and an Ivy League college, and getting all the answers right on
tests—is an inaccurate picture of the typical successful person. I met a number of great people
and learned that none of them were born great—they all made lots of mistakes and had lots
weaknesses—and that great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses
and figuring out how to get around them. So I learned that the people who make the most of the
process of encountering reality, especially the painful obstacles, learn the most and get what they
want faster than people who do not. I learned that they are the great ones—the ones I wanted to
have around me.
In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a
rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.
While this approach worked great for me, I found it more opposite than similar to most others’
approaches, which has produced communications challenges.
Specifically, I found that:
While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I
believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path. 13
While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe
that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning. 14
While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good
things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.
While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I
believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them
and not letting them stand in your way.
While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become
stronger. 15
One of the advantages of my being over 60 years old—and there aren’t many—is that we can look back
on my story to see how I came by these beliefs and how they have worked for me. It is now more than 35
years after I started Bridgewater and about the same number of years since I got married and began my
family. I am obviously not your Ralph Lauren poster child for success, yet I’ve had a lot of successes,
though they’re probably not what you’re thinking.
Yes, I started Bridgewater from scratch, and now it’s a uniquely successful company and I am on the
Forbes 400 list. But these results were never my goals—they were just residual outcomes—so my getting
them can’t be indications of my success. And, quite frankly, I never found them very rewarding. 16

13

After all, isn’t the point of learning to help you get what you want? So don’t you have to start with what you want and figure out
what you have to learn in order to get it?
In fact I believe that most people who are quick to come up with answers simply haven’t thought about all the ways that they can
be wrong.
15
I don’t mean that the more pain the better. I believe that too much pain can break someone and that the absence of pain typically
prevents growth so that one should accept the amount of pain that is consistent with achieving one’s objectives.
16
I have been very lucky because I have had the opportunity to see what it’s like to have little or no money and what it’s like to have
a lot of it. I’m lucky because people make such a big deal of it and, if I didn’t experience both, I wouldn’t be able to know how
important it really is for me. I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot
more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful
work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—
are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money. For me, money has always been very important to

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

What I wanted was to have an interesting, diverse life filled with lots of learning—and especially
meaningful work and meaningful relationships. I feel that I have gotten these in abundance and I am
happy. And I feel that I got what I wanted by following the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old
caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to
do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stresstesting my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I
was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality,
experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could
improve. I believe that by following this approach I moved faster to my goals by learning a lot more than if
I hadn’t followed it.
Here are the most important principles that I learned along the way.

My Most Fundamental Principles
In pursuing my goals I encountered realities, often in the form of problems, and I had to make decisions. I
found that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn’t exist and if I learned how to work
with them rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals. It might take repeated tries,
and seeking the input of others, but I could eventually get there. As a result, I have become someone who
believes that we need to deeply understand, accept, and work with reality in order to get what we want
out of life. Whether it is knowing how people really think and behave when dealing with them, or how
things really work on a material level—so that if we do X then Y will happen—understanding reality gives
us the power to get what we want out of life, or at least to dramatically improve our odds of success. In
other words, I have become a “hyperrealist.”
When I say I’m a hyperrealist, people sometimes think I don’t believe in making dreams happen. This
couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, I believe that without pursuing dreams, life is mundane. I am just
saying that I believe hyperrealism is the best way to choose and achieve one’s dreams. The people who
really change the world are the ones who see what’s possible and figure out how to make that happen. I
believe that dreamers who simply imagine things that would be nice but are not possible don’t sufficiently
appreciate the laws of the universe to understand the true implications of their desires, much less how to
achieve them.
Let me explain what I mean.
I believe there are an infinite number of laws of the universe and that all progress or dreams achieved
come from operating in a way that’s consistent with them. These laws and the principles of how to
operate in harmony with them have always existed. We were given these laws by nature. Man didn’t and
can’t make them up. He can only hope to understand them and use them to get what he wants. For
example, the ability to fly or to send cellular phone signals imperceptibly and instantaneously around the
world or any other new and beneficial developments resulted from understanding and using previously
existing laws of the universe. These inventions did not come from people who were not well-grounded in

the point that I could have these basics covered and never very important beyond that. That doesn’t mean that I don’t think that
having more is good–it’s just that I don’t think it’s a big deal. So, while I spend money on some very expensive things that cost
multiples relative to the more fundamental things, these expensive things have never brought me much enjoyment relative to the
much cheaper, more fundamental things. They were just like cherries on the cake. For my tastes, if I had to choose, I’d rather be a
backpacker who is exploring the world with little money than a big income earner who is in a job I don’t enjoy. (Though being in a job
that provides me with what I want is best of all, for me). Also, from having come from having next-to-nothing to having a lot, I have
developed a strong belief that, all things being equal, offering equal opportunity is fundamental to being good, while handing out
money to capable people that weakens their need to get stronger and contribute to society is bad.

reality. 17 The same is true for economic, political, and social systems that work. Success is achieved by
people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also
true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example,
communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their
idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.
This brings me to my most fundamental principle:

Truth
—more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality—
is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
While I spend the most time studying how the realities that affect me most work—i.e., those that drive the
markets and the people I deal with—I also love to study nature to try to figure out how it works because,
to me, nature is both beautiful and practical.
Its perfection and brilliance staggers me. When I think about all the flying machines, swimming machines,
and billions of other systems that nature created, from the microscopic level to the cosmic level, and how
they interact with one another to make a workable whole that evolves through time and through multidimensions, my breath is taken away. It seems to me that, in relation to nature, man has the intelligence
of a mold growing on an apple—man can’t even make a mosquito, let alone scratch the surface of
understanding the universe.
Though how nature works is way beyond man’s ability to comprehend, I have found that observing how
nature works offers innumerable lessons that can help us understand the realities that affect us. That is
because, though man is unique, he is part of nature and subject to most of the same laws of nature that
affect other species.
For example, I have found that by looking at what is rewarded and punished, and why, universally—i.e.,
in nature as well as in humanity—I have been able to learn more about what is “good” and “bad” than by
listening to most people’s views about good and bad. It seems to me that what most people call “good”
and “bad” typically reflects their particular group’s preferences: the Taliban’s definitions are different than
Americans’, which are different than others’—and within each group there are differences and they are
intended to paint a picture of the world the way they’d like it to be rather than the way it really is. So there
are many different takes on what is good and bad that each group uses to call others “bad” and
themselves “good,” some of which are practical and others of which are impractical. Yet all of them, and
everything else, are subject to the same laws of nature–i.e., I believe that we all get rewarded and
punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature’s laws, and that all
societies will succeed or fail in the degrees that they operate consistently with these laws.
This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating
consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other
words, for something to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with
reality—for example, if morality is in conflict with reality—it is “bad,” i.e., it will not produce good
outcomes.
In other words, I believe that understanding what is good is obtained by looking at the way the world
works and figuring out how to operate in harmony with it to help it (and yourself) evolve. But it is not
obvious, and it is sometimes difficult to accept.

17

I recognize that sometimes a discovery is made by accident, but the discovery is of some basic underlying principle that creates
understanding of a cause-effect relationship that leads to a desired result.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
For example, when a pack of hyenas takes down a young wildebeest, is this good or bad? At face value,
this seems terrible; the poor wildebeest suffers and dies. Some people might even say that the hyenas
are evil. Yet this type of apparently evil behavior exists throughout nature through all species and was
created by nature, which is much smarter than I am, so before I jump to pronouncing it evil, I need to try
to see if it might be good. When I think about it, like death itself, this behavior is integral to the enormously
complex and efficient system that has worked for as long as there has been life. And when I think of the
second- and third-order consequences, it becomes obvious that this behavior is good for both the hyenas,
who are operating in their self-interest, and in the interests of the greater system, which includes the
wildebeest, because killing and eating the wildebeest fosters evolution, i.e., the natural process of
improvement. In fact, if I changed anything about the way that dynamic works, the overall outcome would
be worse.
I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest
single force in the universe, and that it is good. 18 It affects the changes of everything from all species
to the entire solar system. It is good because evolution is the process of adaptation that leads to
improvement. So, based on how I observe both nature and humanity working, I believe that what is bad
and most punished are those things that don’t work because they are at odds with the laws of the
universe and they impede evolution.
I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving
force. Enjoying your job, a craft, or your favorite sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better.
Though most people typically think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money,
status, etc.) that will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we
are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied. 19 It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the
things we have better. In the process of this seeking, we continue to evolve and we contribute to the
evolution of all that we have contact with. The things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase
after them in order to make us evolve, and it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us
and those around us.
It is natural that it should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals rather
than by striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns. 20 For example, suppose making a lot
of money is your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it
would be foolish to continue to have making money be your goal. People who acquire things beyond their
usefulness not only will derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will
experience negative consequences, as with any form of gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing
returns, it is only natural that seeking something new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required
to bring us satisfaction.
In other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of
pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the
personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.
I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to
evolution is universally rewarded, and what I call “good.” Look at all species in action: they are
constantly pursuing their own interests and helping evolution in a symbiotic way, with most of them not
even knowing that their self-serving behaviors are contributing to evolution. Like the hyenas attacking the
wildebeest, successful people might not even know if or how their pursuit of self-interest helps evolution,
but it typically does. 21

18

In fact, it appears to me that everything other than evolution eventually disintegrates and that we all are, and everything else is,
vehicles for evolution.
Of course, we are often satisfied with the same things – relationships, careers, etc.—but when that is the case, it is typically
because we are getting new enjoyments from the new dimensions of these things.
20
The marginal benefits of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline.
21
When pursuing self-interest is in conflict with evolution, it is typically punished.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of selfinterest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that
contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much
money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT
how much they desired to make money. Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will
see that usually it is in proportion to their production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to
their desire to make money. There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made
making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing,
produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it. 22 And there are many people who really wanted to
make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn’t make a lot of money. In
other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving society what it wants and making money,
and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money one makes. I know
that this is true for me—i.e., I never worked to make a lot of money, and if I had I would have stopped
ages ago because of the law of diminishing returns. I know that the same is true for all the successful,
healthy (i.e., non-obsessed) people I know. 23
This process of productive adaptation—i.e., the process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing new goals—
does not just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It is equally relevant when dealing with
setbacks, which are inevitable. That is why many people who have had setbacks that seemed
devastating at the time ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they were before, once they
successfully adapted to them. The faster that one appropriately adapts, the better. As Darwin described,
adaptation—i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in one’s circumstances—is a big part of the
evolutionary process, and it is rewarded. 24 That is why some of the most successful people are typically
those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it. 25
So, it seems to me that desires to evolve are universal and so are symbiotic relationships that lead to the
evolution of the whole to occur via the pursuit of individuals’ self-interests. However, what differentiates
man from other species is man’s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve more and
faster than other species.
I also believe that all things in nature have innate attributes that are both good and bad, with their
goodness and their badness depending on what they are used for. For example, the thorns on a rose
bush, the stinger on a bee, the aggressiveness of a lion, the timidity of a gazelle are all both good and
bad, depending on their applications. Over time, nature evolves toward the right balance through the
process of natural selection—e.g., an overly aggressive animal will die prematurely, as will an overly timid
animal. However, because man has the ability to look at himself and direct his own change, individuals
have the capacity to evolve.
Most of us are born with attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the
more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes are
likely to produce. For example, highly creative, goal-oriented people who are good at imagining the big
picture often can easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while highly pragmatic, task-oriented
people who are great with the details might not be creative. That is because the ways their minds work
make it difficult for them to see both ways of thinking. In nature everything was made for a purpose, and
so too were these different ways of thinking. They just have different purposes. It is extremely important

22

Of course, there are many people who give society what it wants but are paid poorly. This is explained by the law of supply and
demand.
23
I do know some successful people who are obsessed with making money despite making money having little or no marginal
benefit for them.
24
Darwin is reported to have said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the
one that is the most adaptable to change.”
25
Your ability to see the changing landscape and adapt is more a function of your perceptive and reasoning abilities than your ability
to learn and process quickly.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
to one’s happiness and success to know oneself—most importantly to understand one’s own values and
abilities—and then to find the right fits. We all have things that we value that we want and we all have
strengths and weaknesses that affect our paths for getting them. The most important quality that
differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to
these things.
Unlike any other species, man is capable of reflecting on himself and the things around him to learn and
adapt in order to improve. He has this capability because, in the evolution of species man’s brain
developed a part that no other species has—the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human brain that
gives us the ability to reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of this, people who can
objectively reflect on themselves and others —most importantly on their weaknesses are—can figure out
how to get around these weaknesses, can evolve fastest and come closer to realizing their potentials
than those who can’t.
However, typically defensive, emotional reactions—i.e., ego barriers—stand in the way of this progress.
These reactions take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of them, most people
don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward
preventing them from causing them problems. Most people especially dislike others exploring their
weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions; however,
having others help one find one’s weaknesses is essential because it’s very difficult to identify one’s own.
Most people don’t like helping others explore their weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about
them behind their backs. For these reasons most people don’t do a good job of understanding
themselves and adapting in order to get what they want most out of life. In my opinion, that is the biggest
single problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people’s abilities to address all
other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.
Some people get over the ego barrier and others don’t. Which path they choose, more than anything else,
determines how good their outcomes are. Aristotle defined tragedy as a bad outcome for a person
because of a fatal flaw that he can’t get around. So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to
experience bad outcomes.

The Personal Evolutionary Process
As I mentioned before, I believe that life consists of an enormous number of choices that come at us and
that each decision we make has consequences, so the quality of our lives depends on the quality of
the decisions we make.
We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it. 26 We all start off as children with
others, typically parents, directing us. But, as we get older, we increasingly make our own choices. We
choose what we are going after (i.e., our goals), which influences our directions. For example, if you want
to be a doctor, you go to med school; if you want to have a family, you find a mate; and so on. As we
move toward our goals, we encounter problems, make mistakes, and run into personal weaknesses.
Above all else, how we choose to approach these impediments determines how fast we move toward our
goals.
I believe that the way we make our dreams into reality is by constantly engaging with reality in pursuit of
our dreams and by using these encounters to learn more about reality itself and how to interact with it in

26

Of course it is true that people are born with differences in their various innate abilities. However, judgment is primarily learned.

15

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
order to get what we want—and that if we do this with determination, we almost certainly will be
successful. In short:

Reality
+
Dreams
+
Determination
=
A Successful Life
So what is success? I believe that it is nothing more than getting what you want—and that it is up to you
to decide what that is for you. I don’t care whether it’s being a master of the universe, a couch potato, or
anything else—I really don’t. What is essential is that you are clear about what you want and that you
figure out how to get it.
However, there are a few common things that most people want.
As I mentioned, for most people success is evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning about oneself
and one’s environment and then changing to improve. Personally, I believe that personal evolution is both
the greatest accomplishment and the greatest reward.
Also, for most people happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their
expectations rather than the absolute level of their conditions. For example, if a billionaire loses $200
million he will probably be unhappy, while if someone who is worth $10 thousand unexpectedly gets
another $2 thousand, he will probably be happy. This basic principle suggests that you can follow one of
two paths to happiness: 1) have high expectations and strive to exceed them, or 2) lower your
expectations so that they are at or below your conditions. Most of us choose the first path, which means
that to be happy we have to keep evolving.
Another principle to keep in mind is that people need meaningful work and meaningful relationships in
order to be fulfilled. 27 I have observed this to be true for virtually everyone, and I know that it’s true for
me. 28
Regardless of others’ principles, you will need to decide for yourself what you want and go after it in the
best way for you.

Your Most Important Choices
As I mentioned, as we head toward our goals we encounter an enormous number of choices that come at
us, and each decision we make has consequences. So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality
of the decisions we make. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that
are our lives.
Of these millions, I believe that there are five big types of choices that we continually must make that
radically affect the quality of our lives and the rates at which we move toward what we want. Choosing

27

As Freud put it, “Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.”
The work doesn’t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it’s generally better if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term
challenge that leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that the need to have meaningful work is
connected to man’s innate desire to improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make us relevant to
society.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
well is not dependent on our innate abilities such as intelligence or creativity, but more on what I think of
as character. For this reason, I believe that most people can make the right choices.
The following five decision trees show these choices. I believe that those who don’t move effectively to
their goals do the things on the top branches, and those who do move to them most quickly do the things
on the bottom branches.
First:

It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in
order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in
any other way. Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we
have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger
require us to push our limits. Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to
encountering one’s limits, which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from
encountering one’s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decisionmaking process.
Most people react to pain badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it: they either strike out at whatever
brought them the pain or they try to run away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find ways around
their barriers, so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress toward what
they want. 29
Those who react well to pain that stands in the way of getting to their goals—those who understand what
is causing it and how to deal with it so that it can be disposed of as a barrier—gain strength and
satisfaction. This is because most learning comes from making mistakes, reflecting on the causes of the
mistakes, and learning what to do differently in the future. Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if
you approach it correctly, because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since the
only way you are going to find solutions to painful problems is by thinking deeply about them—i.e.,
reflecting 30—if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction to pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it
will lead to your rapid learning/evolving. 31

29

There are literally two different parts of each person’s brain that influence these reactions: the pre-frontal cortex and the
amygdala. They work as though they were two different brains that fight for control of decision-making. The pre-frontal cortex is the
logical part of the brain that evaluates choices logically and the amygdala is the “animal instinct” part of the brain that triggers
emotional reactions like the instinct to fight or flee. When faced with an obstacle or threat, an emotional reaction (e.g. pain) can be
triggered that can lead to a fight or flight reaction that “hijacks” decision making away from the pre-frontal cortex, where the rational
choices are being made. This can result in our making decisions that produce consequences that we do not want. This typically
causes really big problems.
30
Your very unique power of reflectiveness—i.e., your ability to look at yourself, the world around you, and the relationship between
you and the world—means that you can think deeply and weigh subtle things to come up with learning and wise choices. Asking
other believable people about the root causes of your pain in order to enhance your reflections is also typically very helpful—
especially others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right.
31
If you can reflect deeply about your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better
way of dealing with them than if you don’t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you think

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

So, please remember that:

Pain + Reflection = Progress
How big of an impediment is psychological pain to your progress?
Second:

People who confuse what they wish were true with what is really true create distorted pictures of reality
that make it impossible for them to make the best choices. They typically do this because facing “harsh
realities” can be very difficult. However, by not facing these harsh realities, they don’t find ways of
properly dealing with them. And because their decisions are not based in reality, they can’t anticipate the
consequences of their decisions. 32
In contrast, people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally
dealing with it make better decisions.
So, remember…

Ask yourself, “Is it true?”

…because knowing what is true is good.
How much do you let what you wish to be true stand in the way of seeing what is really true?

hard about it and deal with it. After seeing how effectively facing reality—especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses—
works, I believe you will become comfortable with it and won’t want to operate any other way.
32
An example of this is what discussed earlier: wanting to save the wildebeest from the hyenas. When you don’t want to face what’s
really happening, you can’t make sound decisions.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
Third:

People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their
weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain
impediments in the future. 33 These people typically try to prove that they have the answers, even when
they really don’t. Why do they behave in this unproductive way? They typically believe the senseless but
common view that great people are those who have the answers in their heads and don’t have
weaknesses. Not only does this view not square with reality, but it also stands in the way of progress.
I have never met a great person who did not earn and learn their greatness. 34 They have weaknesses like
everyone else—they have just learned how to deal with them so that they aren’t impediments to getting
what they want. In addition, the amounts of knowledge and the capabilities that anyone does not have,
and that could be used to make the best possible decisions, are vastly greater than that which anyone (no
matter how great) could have within them. 35
This explains why people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are
confident that they have the best possible answers. So they seek to learn more (often by exploring
the thinking of other believable people, especially those who disagree with them) and they are eager to
identify their weaknesses so that they don’t let these weaknesses stand in the way of them achieving their
goals.
So, what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you
are on the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So think about them, write them down,
and look at them frequently.
One of my biggest weaknesses is my poor rote memory: I have trouble remembering things that don’t
have reasons for being what they are, such as names, phone numbers, spelling, and addresses. Also, I
am terrible at doing tasks that require little or no logic, especially if I have to do them repeatedly. On the
other hand, I have a great contextual memory and good logic, and I can devote myself to things that
interest me for untold hours. I don’t know how much of what I am bad at is just the other side of what I am
good at—i.e., how much of what I am good at is due to my brain working in a certain way that, when
applied to certain tasks, does well and when applied to others does poorly—and how much of what I am
good at was developed in order to help compensate for what I am bad at. But I do know that I have
created compensating approaches so that what I am bad at doesn’t hurt me much; e.g., I surround myself

33

For example, if you are dumb or ugly, you are unlikely to acknowledge it, even though doing so would help you better deal with
that reality. Recognizing such “harsh realities” is both very painful and very productive.
I am not saying that we all have the same potential, just that to get the most of your potential—whatever that is—you must learn
and earn.
35
As I mentioned in the first chapter, you don’t have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with
yourself about what you don’t know and know who to ask for help.

with people who have good rote memories who do the things that I am bad at, and I carry around tools
like my BlackBerry.
How much do you worry about looking good relative to actually being good?
Fourth:

People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that
the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their
goals. 36 This is because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order
consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision-making. For example, the first-order consequences of
exercise (pain and time-sink) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order
consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes
good is often bad for you and vice versa, etc. If your goal is to get physically fit and you don’t ignore the
first-order consequences of exercise and good-tasting but unhealthy food and connect your decisions
with their second- and third-order consequences, you will not reach your goal.
Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and
sometimes they are barriers that stand in our way of getting what we want. It’s almost as though the
natural selection process sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and
penalizing the dummies who make their decisions just on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.
By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains
that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.
How much do you respond to 1st order consequences at the expense of 2nd and 3rd order
consequences?

Fifth:

36

Sometimes it can be difficult to anticipate the 2nd or 3rd order consequences of a decision, such as one that involves using
complex technology like X-Rays or DDT, where either things are not what they seem to be or there are too many unknown variables
to make a sound decision. For more on the probabilities of personal decision-making, please refer to the “To Make Decisions
Effectively” section at the end of Part 3.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

People who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way
that is at variance with reality, and subversive to their progress.
Blaming bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than one’s self is essentially wishing that reality is
different than it is, which is silly. 37 And it is subversive because it diverts one’s attention away from
mustering up the personal strength and other qualities that are required to produce the best possible
outcomes.
Successful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility
to make their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges
they face. 38 Successful people know that nature is testing them, and that it is not sympathetic. 39
How much do you let yourself off the hook rather than hold yourself accountable for your
success?
In summary, I believe that you can probably get what you want out of life if you can suspend your
ego and take a no-excuses approach to achieving your goals with open-mindedness,
determination, and courage, especially if you rely on the help of people who are strong in areas
that you are weak.
If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is
the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I
believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal
choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature
that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate
you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to
operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the
same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace. Because I believe this, I believe
that whether or not I achieve my goals is a test of what I am made of. It is a game that I play, but this
game is for real. In the next part I explain how I go about playing it.

37

Blaming others is NOT the same thing as holding others accountable, which we will discuss in my Management Principles.
Luck—both good and bad—is a reality. But it is not a reason for an excuse. In life, we have a large number of choices, and luck
can play a dominant role in the outcomes of our choices. But if you have a large enough sample size—if you have large number of
decisions (if you are playing a lot of poker hands, for example)—over time, luck will cancel out and skill will have a dominant role in
determining outcomes. A superior decision-maker will produce superior outcomes. That does not mean there won’t be certain bad(or good-) luck events that are life changing: a friend of mine dove into a swimming pool and became a quadriplegic. But he
approached his situation well and became as happy as anybody else, because there are many paths to happiness. What happens
to a lot of people is that they don’t take personal responsibility for their outcomes, and as a result fail to make the best possible
decisions.
39
As I mentioned earlier, I believe that nature is symbiotic—and that we must give to it for it to give back.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

In summary, I don’t believe that limited abilities are an insurmountable barrier to achieving your
goals, if you do the other things right.
As always, it is up to you to ask yourself if what I am saying is true. As the next part delves into this
concept more, you might want to reserve your judgment until after you have read it.

Your Two Yous and Your Machine
Those who are most successful are capable of “higher level thinking” —i.e., they are able to step back
and design a “machine” consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want. They
are able to assess and improve how their “machine” works by comparing the outcomes that the machine
is producing with the goals. Schematically, the process is as shown in the diagram below. It is a
feedback loop:

That schematic is meant to convey that your goals will determine the “machine” that you create to achieve
them; that machine will produce outcomes that you should compare with your goals to judge how your
machine is working. Your “machine” will consist of the design and people you choose to achieve the
goals. For example, if you want to take a hill from an enemy you will need to figure out how to do that—
e.g., your design might need two scouts, two snipers, four infantrymen, one person to deliver the food,
etc. While having the right design is essential, it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the
right people in each of these positions. They need different qualities to play their positions well—e.g., the
scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be precise shots, etc. If your outcomes are inconsistent
with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to modify your “machine,” which means that
you either have to modify your design/culture or modify your people. Do this often and well and your
improvement process will look like the one on the left and do it poorly and it will look like the one on the
right, or worse:

22

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

I call it “higher level thinking” because your perspective is of one who is looking down on at your
machine and yourself objectively, using the feedback loop as I previously described. In other words,
your most important role is to step back and design, operate and improve your “machine” to get what you
want.

Think of it as though there are two yous—you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your
goals (let’s call that one you(1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will
call you(2)). You(2) are a resource that you(1) have to get what you(1) want, but by no means your only
resource. To be successful you(1) have to be objective about you(2).
© 2011 Ray Dalio

23

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

Let’s imagine that your goal is to have a winning basketball team. Wouldn’t it be silly to put yourself in a
position that you don’t play well? If you did, you wouldn’t get what you want. Whatever your goals are,
achieving them works the same way.
If you(1) see that you(2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you(1) to have
someone else do it. In other words, you(1) should look down on you(2) and all the other resources at
your(1) disposal and create a “machine” to achieve your(1) goals, remembering that you(1) don’t
necessarily need to do anything other than to design and manage the machine to get what you(1) want. If
you(1) find that you(2) can’t do something well fire yourself(2) and get a good replacement! You
shouldn’t be upset that you found out that you(2) are bad at that—you(1) should be happy because
you(1) have improved your(1) chances of getting what you(1) want. If you(1) are disappointed because
you(2) can’t be the best person to do everything, you(1) are terribly naïve because nobody can do
everything well.
The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively. If they
could just get around this, they could live up to their potentials.
How much do you intellectually agree with what I just said?
How good are you in approaching life as a “higher level thinker” rather than as a doer?
How much would you like to get better at this?
How much do you think that reading this is a waste of time?

My 5-Step Process to Getting What You 40 Want Out of Life
There are five things that you have to do to get what you want out of life. First, you have to choose your
goals, which will determine your direction. Then you have to design a plan to achieve your goals. On the
way to your goals, you will encounter problems. As I mentioned, these problems typically cause pain.
The most common source of pain is in exploring your mistakes and weaknesses. You will either react
badly to the pain or react like a master problem solver. That is your choice. To figure out how to get
around these problems you must be calm and analytical to accurately diagnose your problems. Only
after you have an accurate diagnosis of them can you design a plan that will get you around your
problems. Then you have to do the tasks specified in the plan. Through this process of encountering
problems and figuring out how to get around them, you will become progressively more capable and
achieve your goals more easily. Then you will set bigger, more challenging goals, in the same way that
someone who works with weights naturally increases the poundage. This is the process of personal
evolution, which I call my 5-Step Process.
In other words, “The Process” consists of five distinct steps:
Have clear goals.
Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
Accurately diagnose these problems.

40

The you I am referring to here is the strategic you – the one who is deciding on what you want and how best to get it, previously
referred to as you (1).

© 2011 Ray Dalio

24

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to
your goals.
Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks.
You need to do all of these steps well in order to be successful.
Before discussing these individual steps in more detail, I want to make a few general points about the
process.
1) You must approach these as distinct steps rather than blur them together. For example,
when setting goals, just set goals (don’t think how you will achieve them or the other steps); when
diagnosing problems, just diagnose problems (don’t think about how you will solve them or the
other steps). Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes because it creates confusion and
short-changes the individual steps. Doing each step thoroughly will provide information that will
help you do the other steps well, since the process is iterative.
2) Each of these five steps requires different talents and disciplines. Most probably, you have
lots of some of these and inadequate amounts of others. If you are missing any of the required
talents and disciplines, that is not an insurmountable problem because you can acquire them,
supplement them, or compensate for not having them, if you recognize your weaknesses and
design around them. So you must be honestly self-reflective.
3) It is essential to approach this process in a very clear-headed, rational way rather than
emotionally. Figure out what techniques work best for you; e.g., if emotions are getting the better
of you, take time out until you can reflect unemotionally, seek the guidance of calm, thoughtful
others, etc.
To help you do these things well—and stay centered and effective rather than stressed and thrown off by
your emotions—try this technique for reducing the pressure: treat your life like a game or a martial art.
Your mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of
playing the game or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will
progress to ever-higher levels of the game that will require—and teach you—greater skills. I will explain
what these skills are in the next section. However, the big and really great news is that you don’t need
to have all of these skills to succeed! You just have to 1) know they are needed; 2) know you don’t
have some of them; and 3) figure out how to get them (i.e., either learn them or work with others who
have them).
This particular game—i.e., your life—will challenge you in ways that will be uncomfortable at times. But if
you work through this discomfort and reflect on it in order to learn, you will significantly improve your
chances of getting what you want out of life. By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it
doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what
you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which often are difficult
but produce good results—so that you’ll then deserve to get what you want.
That’s just the way it is, so you might as well accept it. Once you accept that playing the game will be
uncomfortable, and you do it for a while, it will become much easier (like it does when getting fit). When
you excel at it, you will find your ability to get what you want thrilling. You’ll see that excuses like “That’s
not easy” are of no value and that it pays to “push through it” at a pace you can handle. Like getting
physically fit, the most important thing is that you keep moving forward at whatever pace you choose,
recognizing the consequences of your actions. When you think that it’s too hard, remember that in the
long run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful. The firstorder consequences of escaping life’s challenges may seem pleasurable in the moment, but the secondand third-order consequences of this approach are your life and, over time, will be painful. With practice,
you will eventually play this game like a ninja, with skill and a calm centeredness in the face of adversity
that will let you handle most of your numerous challenges well.

25

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

However, you will never handle them all well: mistakes are inevitable, and it’s important to recognize and
accept this fact of life. The good news, as I have mentioned, is that most learning comes through making
mistakes—so there is no end to learning how to play the game better. You will have an enormous
number of decisions to make, so no matter how many mistakes you make, there will be plenty of
opportunities to build a track record of success.
That’s basically the whole concept.
Let’s pause and reflect on this before moving on.
Does what I am saying make sense to you?
Do you agree that it is true?
If not, why not?
If you can’t work through your doubts alone, speak to me or to others about it, but PLEASE do not
proceed until you agree with the basic logic behind the 5-Step Process. Either you will get comfortable
with it and internalize it or you will point out something that is wrong and the process will get better.
What follows now is a closer examination of each of the five steps.

The 5 Steps Close-Up
1) Setting Goals
You can have virtually anything you want, but you can’t have everything you want.
The first, most important, and typically most difficult step in the 5-Step Process is setting goals, because it
forces you to decide what you really want and therefore what you can possibly get out of life. This is the
step where you face the fundamental limit: life is like a giant smorgasbord of more delicious alternatives
than you can ever hope to taste. So you have to reject having some things you want in order to get other
things you want more.
Some people fail at this point, afraid to reject a good alternative for fear that the loss will deprive them of
some essential ingredient to their personal happiness. As a result, they pursue too many goals at the
same time, achieving few or none of them.
So it’s important to remember: it doesn’t really matter if some things are unavailable to you, because the
selection of what IS available is so great. (That is why many people who had major losses—e.g., who lost
their ability to walk, to see, etc.—and who didn’t narrow-mindedly obsess about their loss but rather openmindedly accepted and enjoyed what remained, had equally happy lives as those who didn’t ever have
these losses.)
In other words, you can have an enormous amount: much, much more than what you need to have for a
happy life. So don’t get discouraged by not being able to have everything you want, and for God’s sake,
don’t be paralyzed by the choices. That’s nonsensical and unproductive. Get on with making your
choices.
Put another way, to achieve your goals you have to prioritize, and that includes rejecting good
alternatives (so that you have the time and resources to pursue even better ones—time being probably
your greatest limiting factor, though, through leverage, you can substantially reduce time’s constraints).

26

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
It is important not to confuse “goals” and “desires.”
Goals are the things that you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent
you from reaching your goals—as I previously explained, desires are typically first-order consequences.
For example, a goal might be physical fitness, while a desire is the urge to eat good-tasting, unhealthy
food (i.e., a first-order consequence) that could undermine you obtaining your fitness goal. So, in terms of
the consequences they produce, goals are good and desires are bad. 41
Don’t get me wrong; I believe you can choose to pursue any goal you want as long as you consider the
consequences. So, staying with this example, I think it is perfectly OK for you to make your goal to enjoy
eating good-tasting, unhealthy food if that choice will bring you what you really want. As I said earlier, if
you want to be a couch potato, that’s fine with me—seriously. But if that’s not what you want, you better
not open that bag of chips. In other words, failing to make the distinction between goals and desires will
lead you in the wrong direction, because you will be inclined to pursue things you want that will
undermine your ability to get things you want more. In short, you can pursue anything you desire—just
make sure that you know the consequences of what you are doing.
Another common reason people fail at this stage is that they lose sight of their goals, getting caught up in
day-to-day tasks.
Avoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.
As I said before, do each step separately and distinctly without regard to the others. In this case, that
means don’t rule out a goal due to a superficial assessment of its attainability. Once you commit to a goal,
it might take lots of thinking and many revisions to your plan over a considerable time period in order to
finalize the design and do the tasks to achieve it. So you need to set goals without yet assessing whether
or not you can achieve them.
This requires some faith that you really can achieve virtually anything, 42 even if you don’t know how you
will do it at that moment. Initially you have to have faith that this is true, but after following this process
and succeeding at achieving your goals, you will gain confidence. If you like, you can start with more
modest goals and, when you build up the track record to give you faith, increase your aspirations.
Every time I set goals, I don’t yet have any idea how I am going to achieve them because I haven’t yet
gone through the process of thinking through them. But I have learned that I can achieve them if I think
creatively and work hard. 43
I also know that I can “cheat.” Unlike in school, in life you don’t have to come up with all the right answers.
You can ask the people around you for help—or even ask them to do the things you don’t do well.
In other words, there is almost no reason not to succeed if you take the attitude of 1) total flexibility—good
answers can come from anyone or anywhere (and in fact, as I have mentioned, there are far more good
answers “out there” than there are in you) and 2) total accountability: regardless of where the good
answers come from, it’s your job to find them.

41
Some societies define evil to be the desires that can take you away from your goals, which I think is a good way of seeing the
difference between goals and desires. That doesn’t mean I think that there isn’t room for a little “bad”, but I do think that desires that
fundamentally divert you from your goals should be avoided at all cost.
42
This might sound inconsistent with the previous point that you can’t have everything. It’s not. I am saying that, at this stage of
goal-setting, don’t set your goals based on what you think you can achieve. In the process of doing the other four steps (especially
designing) you will thoroughly think through what is possible. Then you will circle back and enter the goal-setting mode again. As I
mentioned, this five-step process is iterative, but it must be pursued one step at a time in order to do each step excellently.
43
The more creative I am, the less hard I have to work.

27

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
This no-excuses approach helps me do whatever it takes to get whatever I want most. Not all goals are
achievable, of course. There are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as living forever, or
flying with just the power of your arms. But it’s been my experience that if I commit to bringing creativity,
flexibility, and determination to the pursuit of my goals, I will figure out some way to get them, i.e., almost
all goals are attainable. And as I don’t limit my goals to what seems attainable at the moment I set them,
the goals I set tend to be higher than they would otherwise be. Since trying to achieve high goals makes
me stronger, I become increasingly capable of achieving more. Great expectations create great
capabilities, in other words. And if I fail to achieve my goal, it just tells me that I have not been creative or
flexible or determined enough to do what it takes, and I circle back and figure out what I need to do about
this situation.
Achieving your goals isn’t just about moving forward.
Inevitably, you must deal with setbacks. So goals aren’t just those things that you want and don’t have.
They might also be keeping what you do have, minimizing your rate of loss, or dealing with irrevocable
loss. Life will throw you challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. Your goal is always
to make the best possible choices, knowing that you will be rewarded if you do. It’s like playing golf:
sometimes you will be in the fairway and sometimes you will be in the rough, so you have to know how to
play it as it lies.
Generally speaking, goal-setting is best done by those who are good at big-picture conceptual thinking,
synthesizing, visualizing, and prioritizing. But whatever your strengths and weaknesses are, don’t forget
the big and really great news here: it is not essential that you have all of these qualities yourself, because
you can supplement them with the help of others.
In summary, in order to get what you want, the first step is to really know what you want, without
confusing goals with desires, and without limiting yourself because of some imagined impediments that
you haven’t thoroughly analyzed.
How well do you know what you want most out of life?
What are your most important goals?
Are you good at setting your goals?
How confident are you that your assessment of you ability to set goals is right?
If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have
a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?

2) Identifying and Not Tolerating Problems
After you set your goals, you must come up with a plan or a design to achieve them and then you must
execute that plan by doing the tasks. On the way to achieving your goals and executing your design, you
will encounter problems that have to be diagnosed, so that the design can be modified to get around
these obstacles. That’s why you need to identify and not tolerate problems.
Most problems are potential improvements screaming at you.

© 2011 Ray Dalio

28

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
Whenever a problem surfaces, you have in front of you an opportunity to improve. The more painful the
problem, the louder it is screaming. 44 In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems
and 2) not tolerate them.
If you don’t identify your problems, you won’t solve them, so you won’t move forward toward achieving
your goals. As a result, it is essential to bring problems to the surface.
Most people don’t like to do this. But most successful people know that they have to do this.
The most common reasons people don’t successfully identify their problems are generally rooted either in
a lack of will or in a lack of talent or skill:
•
•
•

•
•

They can be “harsh realities” that are unpleasant to look at, so people often subconsciously put
them “out of sight” so they will be “out of mind.”
Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve can produce anxiety that stands in the way of
progress.
People often worry more about appearing to not have problems than about achieving their
desired results, and therefore avoid recognizing that their own mistakes and/or weaknesses
are causing the problems. This aversion to seeing one’s own mistakes and weaknesses typically
occurs because they’re viewed as deficiencies you’re stuck with rather than as essential parts of
the personal evolution process.
Sometimes people are simply not perceptive enough to see the problems.
Some people are unable to distinguish big problems from small ones. Since nothing is
perfect, it is possible to identify an infinite number of problems everywhere. If you are unable to
distinguish the big problems from the little ones, you can’t “successfully” (i.e., in a practical way)
identify problems.

Remember, you don’t have to be good at any of the five steps (in this case, identifying problems) to be
successful if you get help from others. So push through the pain of facing your problems, knowing
you will end up in a much better place.
When identifying problems, it is important to remain centered and logical.
While it can be tempting to react emotionally to problems and seek sympathy or blame others, this
accomplishes nothing. 45 Whatever the reasons, you have to get over the impediments to succeed.
Remember that the pains you are feeling are “growing pains” that will test your character and reward you
if you push through them. Try to look at your problems as a detached observer would. Remember that
identifying problems is like finding gems embedded in puzzles; if you solve the puzzles you will
get the gems that will make your life much better. Doing this continuously will lead to your rapid
evolution. So, if you’re logical, you really should get excited about finding problems because identifying
them will bring you closer to your goals.
How good are you at perceiving problems?
How confident are you that your assessment of your ability to perceive problems is right?

44

Though I’ve said it before, it’s worth saying again: I understand that recognizing harsh realities can be extremely painful. But I’ve
learned that if you can stare hard at your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better
way of dealing with them than if you don’t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you stare
at it and deal with it. After seeing how effectively facing reality – especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses – works, you
will become comfortable with it and won’t want to operate any other way. I also believe that one of the best ways of getting at truth is
reflecting with others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right.
45
This is typically because they let their emotions control their behavior and/or they haven’t learned how to deal with their problems
e.g., the amygdala is “hijacking” decision-making away from the pre-frontal cortex.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have
a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?
Be very precise in specifying your problems.
It is essential to identify your problems with precision, for different problems have different solutions. For
example, if your impediments are due largely to issues of will—to your unwillingness to confront what is
really happening—you have to strengthen your will, for example by starting small and building up your
confidence.
If your problems are related to lack of skill or innate talent, the most powerful antidote is to have others
point things out to you and objectively consider whether what they identify is true. Problems due to
inadequate skill might then be solved with training, whereas those arising from innate weaknesses might
be overcome with assistance or role changes. It doesn’t matter which is the case; it only matters that the
true cause is identified and appropriately addressed. 46
The more precise you are, the easier it will be to come up with accurate diagnoses and successful
solutions. For example, rather than saying something like “People don’t like me,” it is better to specify
which people don’t like you and under what circumstances.
Don’t confuse problems with causes.
“I can’t get enough sleep” is not a problem; it is a cause of some problem. What exactly is that problem?
To avoid confusing the problem with its causes, try to identify the suboptimal outcome, e.g., “I am
performing badly in my job because I am tired.”
Once you identify your problems, you must not tolerate them.
Tolerating problems has the same result as not identifying them (i.e., both stand in the way of getting past
the problem), but the root causes are different. Tolerating problems might be due to not thinking that they
can be solved, or not caring enough about solving them. 47 People who tolerate problems are the worse off
because, without the motivation to move on, they cannot succeed. In other words, if you are motivated,
you can succeed even if you don’t have the abilities (i.e., talents and skills) because you can get the help
from others. But if you’re not motivated to succeed, if you don’t have the will to succeed, the situation is
hopeless.
How much do you tolerate problems?
How confident are you that your assessment of how much you tolerate problems is right?
If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have
a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?
People who are good at this step—identifying and not tolerating problems—tend to have strong abilities to
perceive and synthesize a clear and accurate picture, as well as demonstrate a fierce intolerance of
badness (regardless of the severity).
Remember that you need to do each step independently from the other steps before moving on.

46

There are also other antidotes that we will delve into in the next book.
Not caring to solve problems often occurs when the expected reward is less than the expected cost. For example, when
someone is working toward someone else’s goals without being appropriately supervised, rewarded or punished.

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

Can you comfortably identify your problems without thinking about how to solve them? It is a good
exercise to just make a list of them, without possible solutions. Only after you have created a clear picture
of your problems should you go to the next step.
For a more detailed explanation of identifying and not tolerating problems, please read My Management
Principles.

3) Diagnosing the Problems
You will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to
solutions.
It is a very common mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed
solution in a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a solution.
This typically yields bad decisions that don’t alleviate the problem. Diagnosing and designing are what
spark strategic thinking.
You must be calm and logical.
When diagnosing problems, as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes
difficult to avoid, can undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will
serve you well. So if you are finding yourself shaken by your problems, do what you can to get yourself
centered before moving forward.
You must get at the root causes.
Root causes, like principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated
reasons behind the actions that cause problems. So you will get many everlasting dividends if you can
find them and properly deal with them.
It is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. Proximate causes typically are the
actions or lack of actions that lead to problems—e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the train
schedule.” So proximate causes are typically described via verbs. Root causes are the deeper reasons
behind the proximate cause: “I didn’t check the schedule because I am forgetful”—a root cause. Root
causes are typically described with adjectives, usually characteristics about what the person is like that
lead them to an action or an inaction.
Identifying the real root causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems
only by removing their root causes. In other words, you must understand, accept, and successfully deal
with reality in order to move toward your goals.
Recognizing and learning from one’s mistakes and the mistakes of others who affect outcomes is
critical to eliminating problems.
Many problems are caused by people’s mistakes. But people often find it difficult to identify and accept
their own mistakes. Sometimes it’s because they’re blind to them, but more often it’s because ego and
shortsightedness make discovering their mistakes and weaknesses painful. Because people are often
upset when their mistakes are pointed out to them, most people are reluctant to point out mistakes in
others. As a result, an objective diagnosis of problems arising from people’s mistakes is often missing
and personal evolution is stunted. (As I mentioned in the last chapter, most learning comes from making
mistakes and experiencing the pain of them—e.g., putting your hand on a hot stove—and adapting.) It is
at this stage that most people fail to progress. More than anything else, what differentiates people
who live up to their potential from those who don’t is a willingness to look at themselves and
others objectively.

31

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

I call the pain that comes from looking at yourself and others objectively “growing pains,” because it is the
pain that accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain. Of course, anyone who really understands that
no one is perfect and that these discoveries are essential for personal growth finds that these discoveries
elicit “growing pleasures.” But it seems to be in our nature to overly focus on short-term gratification rather
than long-term satisfaction—on first-order rather than second- or third-order consequences—so the
connection between this behavior and the rewards it brings doesn’t come naturally. However, if you can
make this connection, such moments will begin to elicit pleasure rather than pain. It is similar to how
exercise eventually becomes pleasurable for people who hardwire the connection between exercise and
its benefits.
Remember that:

Pain + Reflection = Progress

Much as you might wish this were not so, this is a reality that you should just accept and deal with. There
is no getting around the fact that achieving success requires getting at the root causes of all important
problems, and people’s mistakes and weaknesses are sometimes the root causes. So to be successful,
you must be willing to look at your own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of
problems.
Of course, some problems aren’t caused by people making mistakes. For example, if lightning strikes, it
causes problems that have nothing to do with human error. All problems need to be well-diagnosed
before you decide what to do about them.
The most important qualities for successfully diagnosing problems are logic, the ability to see
multiple possibilities, and the willingness to touch people’s nerves to overcome the ego barriers
that stand in the way of truth.
For a more detailed explanation of diagnosing problems, please read My Management Principles.
In diagnosing problems, how willing are you to “touch the nerve” (i.e., discuss your and others
possible mistakes and weaknesses with them)?
Are you willing to get at root causes, like what people are like?
Are you good at seeing the patterns and synthesizing them into diagnoses of root causes?
How confident are you that your assessment of your ability to diagnose is accurate?
If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have
a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?

4) Designing the Plan (Determining the Solutions)
In some cases, you might go from setting goals to designing the plans that will get you to these goals;
while in other cases, you will encounter problems on the way to your goals and have to design your way
around them. So design will occur at both stages of the process, though it will occur much more often in
figuring out how to get around problems. In other words, most of the movement toward your goals comes
from designing how to remove the root causes of your problems. Problems are great because they are
very specific impediments, so you know that you will move forward if you can identify and eliminate their
root causes.
Creating a design is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time
in order to achieve the goal.

© 2011 Ray Dalio

32

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles

Visualize the goal or problem standing in your way, and then visualize practical solutions. When
designing solutions, the objective is to change how you do things so that problems don’t recur—or recur
so often. Think about each problem individually, and as the product of root causes—like the outcomes
produced by a machine. Then think about how the machine should be changed to produce good
outcomes rather than bad ones. There are typically many paths toward achieving your goals, and you
need to find only one of them that works, so it’s almost always doable.
But an effective design requires thinking things through and visualizing how things will come together and
unfold over time. It’s essential to visualize the story of where you have been (or what you have done) that
has led you to where you are now and what will happen sequentially in the future to lead you to your
goals. You should visualize this plan through time, like watching a movie that connects your past, present,
and future.
Then write down the plan so you don’t lose sight of it, and include who needs to do what and when. The
list of tasks falls out from this story (i.e., the plan), but they are not the same. The story, or plan, is what
connects your goals to the tasks. For you to succeed, you must not lose sight of the goals or the story
while focusing on the tasks; you must constantly refer back and forth. In My Management Principles (Part
3), you can see one such plan.
When designing your plan, think about the timelines of various interconnected tasks. Sketch them out
loosely and then refine them with the specific tasks. This is an iterative process, alternating between
sketching out your broad steps (e.g., hire great people) and filling these in with more specific tasks with
estimated timelines (e.g., in the next two weeks choose the headhunters to find the great people) that will
have implications (e.g., costs, time, etc.). These will lead you to modify your design sketch until the design
and tasks work well together. Being as specific as possible (e.g., specifying who will do what and when)
allows you to visualize how the design will work at both a big-picture level and in detail. It will also give
you and others the to-do lists and target dates that will help direct you.
Of course, not all plans will accomplish everything you want in the desired time frame. In such cases, it is
essential that you look at what won’t be accomplished and ask yourself if the consequences are
acceptable or unacceptable. This is where perspective is required, and discussing it with others can be
critical. If the plan will not achieve what’s necessary in the required time, so that the consequences have
an unacceptably high probability of preventing you from achieving your goal, you have to either think
harder (probably with the advice of other believable people) to make the plan do what is required or
reduce your goals.
It doesn’t take much time to design a good plan—literally just hours spread out over days or weeks—and
whatever amount of time you spend designing it will be only a small fraction of the time you spend
executing it. But designing is very important because it determines what you will have to do to be
effective. Most people make the very big mistake of spending virtually no time on this step because they
are too preoccupied with execution. This process is explained in detail in My Management Principles.
People successful with this stage have an ability to visualize and a practical understanding of how
things really work. Remember, you don’t have to possess all these qualities if you have someone to help
you with the ones you are missing.
How good is your ability to visualize?
How confident are you that your assessment of your ability to visualize is accurate?
If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. do have an
excellent track record of visualizing and making what you visualized happen, have other
believable parties told you that you are good at this)?

© 2011 Ray Dalio

33

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
Remember: Designing precedes doing! The design will give you your to-do list (i.e., the tasks).

5) Doing the Tasks
Next, you and the others you need to rely on have to do the tasks that will get you to your goals. Great
planners who don’t carry out their plans go nowhere. You need to “push through” to accomplish the goals.
This requires the self-discipline to follow the script that is your design. I believe the importance of good
work habits is vastly underrated. There are lots of books written about good work habits, so I won’t
digress into what I believe is effective. However, it is critical to know each day what you need to do
and have the discipline to do it. People with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably
prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to be done. By contrast, people with poor work
habits almost randomly react to the stuff that comes at them, or they can’t bring themselves to do the
things they need to do but don’t like to do (or are unable to do). There are lots of tools that can help (e.g.,
thank God for my BlackBerry!)
You need to know whether you (and others) are following the plan, so you should establish clear
benchmarks. Ideally you should have someone other than yourself objectively measure if you (and
others) are doing what you planned. If not, you need to diagnose why and resolve the problem.
People who are good at this stage can reliably execute a plan. They tend to be self-disciplined and
proactive rather than reactive to the blizzard of daily tasks that can divert them from execution. They are
results-oriented: they love to push themselves over the finish line to achieve the goal. If they see
that daily tasks are taking them away from executing the plan (i.e., they identify this problem), they
diagnose it and design how they can deal with both the daily tasks and moving forward with the plan.
As with the other steps, if you aren’t good at this step, get help. There are many successful, creative
people who are good at the other steps but who would have failed because they aren’t good at execution.
But they succeeded nonetheless because of great symbiotic relationships with highly reliable task-doers.
For a more detailed explanation of doing what you set out to do, please see My Management Principles.
How good are you at pushing through?
How confident are you that your assessment of your ability to push through is accurate?
If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be confident (e.g. because you have
a demonstrated track-record, because many believable people have told you, etc)?

The Relationships between These Steps
Designs and tasks have no purpose other than to achieve your goals. Said differently, goals are the sole
purpose of designs and tasks. So you mustn’t forget how they’re related. Frequently I see people feel
great about doing their tasks while forgetting the goals they were designed to achieve, resulting in the
failure to achieve their goals. This doesn’t make any sense, because the only purpose of tasks is to
achieve goals. In order to be successful, your goals must be riveted in your mind: they are the things you
MUST do. To remember the connections between the tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve,
you just have to ask, “Why?” It is good to connect tasks to goals this way (with the “Why?”), because
losing sight of the connections will prevent you from succeeding.
Again, this 5-Step Process is iterative. This means that after completing one of the steps you will probably
have acquired relevant information that leads you to modify the other steps.

© 2011 Ray Dalio

34

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
If this process is working, goals will change much more slowly than designs, which will change more
slowly than tasks. Designs and tasks can be modified or changed often (because you might want to
reassess how to achieve the goal), but changing goals frequently is usually a problem because achieving
them requires a consistent effort. I often find that people who have problems reaching their goals handle
these steps backwards; that is, they stick too rigidly to specified tasks and are not committed enough to
achieving their goals (often because they lose sight of them).

Weaknesses Don’t Matter if You Find Solutions
To repeat, the best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what you want, then ask ‘what is true,’ and
then ask yourself ‘what should be done about it.’ If you honestly ask and answer these questions you will
move much faster towards what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!
Most importantly, ask yourself what is your biggest weakness that stands in the way of what you
want.
As I mentioned before, everyone has weaknesses. The main difference between unsuccessful and
successful people is that unsuccessful people don’t find and address them, and successful people do.
It is difficult to see one’s own blind spots for two reasons:
1) Most people don’t go looking for their weaknesses because of “ego barriers”—they find having
weaknesses painful because society has taught them that having weaknesses is bad. As I said
early on, I believe that we would have a radically more effective and much happier society if we
taught the truth, which is that everyone has weaknesses, and knowing about them and how to
deal with them is how people learn and succeed.
2) Having a weakness is like missing a sense—if you can’t visualize what it is, it’s hard to perceive
not having it.
For these two reasons, having people show you what you are missing can be painful, though its essential
for your progress. When you encounter that pain, try to remember that you can get what you want out
of life if you can open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in your way
and then deal with it.
What do you think is the biggest weakness you have that stands in the way of what you want – the
one that you repeatedly run into?
People who don’t get what they want out of life fail at one or more of the five steps. But being weak at
any one of these steps is not a problem if you understand what you are weak at and successfully
compensate for that weakness by seeking help. For example, a good goal-setter who is bad at doing
tasks might work well with a bad goal-setter who is great at doing tasks—i.e., they will be much more
successful working together. It is easy to find out what weaknesses are standing in your way by 1)
identifying which steps you are failing at and 2) getting the feedback of people who are successful at
doing what you are having problems with.
Because I believe that you will achieve your goals if you do these five steps well, it follows that if you are
not achieving your goals you can use the 5-Step Process as a diagnostic tool. You would do this by 1)
identifying the step(s) that you are failing at; 2) noting the qualities required to succeed at that step; and
3) identifying which of these qualities you are missing.

© 2011 Ray Dalio

35

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
To repeat, the five steps and the qualities that I believe are required to be good at them are as follows:

At which step do you have the most problem?
Which qualities needed do you wish you had more of?
In a nutshell, my 5-Step process for achieving what you want is:

Values→ 1) Goals → 2) Problems → 3) Diagnoses → 4) Designs → 5) Tasks
Your values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. In trying to achieve your goals, you will encounter
problems that have to be diagnosed. Only after determining the real root causes of these problems can
you design a plan to get around them. Once you have a good plan, you have to muster the self-discipline
to do what is required to make the plan succeed. Note that this process starts with your values, but it
requires that you succeed at all five steps. While these steps require different abilities, you don’t have to
be good at all of them. If you aren’t good at all of them (which is true for almost everyone), you need to
know what you are bad at and how to compensate for your weaknesses. This requires you to put your
ego aside, objectively reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and seek the help from others.
As you design and implement your plan to achieve your goals, you may find it helpful to consider that:
•
•
•
•

Life is like a game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving
your goals;
You get better at this game through practice;
The game consists of a series of choices that have consequences;
You can’t stop the problems and choices from coming at you, so it’s better to learn how to deal
with them;

© 2011 Ray Dalio

36

Part 2: My Most Fundamental Life Principles
•
•
•
•

You have the freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it’s best to be mindful of their
consequences;
The pain of problems is a call to find solutions rather than a reason for unhappiness and inaction,
so it’s silly, pointless, and harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you
(though it’s understandable);
We all evolve at different paces, and it’s up to you to decide the pace at which you want to
evolve; 48
The process goes better if you are as accurate as possible in all respects, including assessing
your strengths and weaknesses and adapting to them.

While all this may sound very theoretical, it is integral to how we operate every day. For example, my
management principles, which are explained in the next section, are based on the principles that I
described in this section. So, Bridgewater is based on the core belief that everyone here is evolving
together. How well and how quickly we do that will have a huge effect on our well-being and the wellbeing of all the people we have contact with (e.g., our clients, our families, etc.). These two things are
inextricably linked. Bridgewater is also based on the belief that to be successful and happy, not only do
we have to be excellent, we have to continue to improve at a surprisingly fast rate. Bridgewater operates
consistently with the belief that to be excellent and improve at a fast rate, we must be hyperrealistic and
hypertruthful. We therefore need to overcome any impediments to being realistic and truthful, and the
biggest impediment is people’s reluctance to face their own mistakes and weaknesses and those of
others. Bridgewater is based on the belief that both meaningful work and meaningful relationships are
required to be happy and successful. So, our relationships, like our work, must be excellent; as a result,
we expect people to be extremely considerate and caring with each other. This does not mean being soft
on each other, especially if that means avoiding harsh realities to avoid causing discomfort. It means true
caring, which requires recognizing and successfully dealing with our realities, whatever they are.
The management principles that follow reflect these core values and the specific ways that they are lived
out at Bridgewater.

48

The organization Outward Bound has a concept that is helpful in thinking about the optimal pace of personal evolution. They
speak of a comfort zone, a stretch zone and a panic zone. It’s best to spend most of your time in the stretch zone.

Part 3: My Management Principles

Part 3: My Management Principles
In Part 1 I explained why I believe having principles is important and that I believe that it is up to each
person to decide what principles are best for them. In Part 2 I explained my most fundamental principles.
In this part I explain my management principles. Naturally, my management principles reflect the
principles I believe are best throughout my life. But before I get into my particular management
principles, I’d like to touch on management principles in general.
If you read any of the earlier parts you know that I believe that having principles is essential for getting
what you want out of life. That is as true for groups of people (e.g., companies, schools, governments,
foundations, etc.) as it is for individuals. While individuals operating individually can choose whatever
values and principles they like, when working in a group the people must agree on the group’s values and
principles. If the group is not clear about them, confusion and eventually gravitation toward the
population’s averages will result. If the group’s values and principles are clear, their way of being (i.e.,
their culture) will permeate everything they do. It will drive how the people in the group set goals, identify
problems, diagnose problems, design solutions and make sure that these designs are implemented. So I
believe this relationship looks like this:

While having a clearly conveyed great culture is important, that’s only half of the magic formula. The
other half is having great people—i.e., people who have the values, abilities, skills that fit the
organization’s culture.
In other words, I believe that to have a great company you have to make two things great —the culture
and the people. If these two things are great your organization can navigate the twists and turns to get
you where you want to go.
Of course, you have to know where you want to go. Organizations, like individuals, have to choose what
they are going after (i.e., their goals), which influences their directions. As they move toward their goals,
they encounter problems, make mistakes and discover weaknesses. Above all else, how they choose to
approach these impediments determines how fast they move toward their goals.
Every organization works like a machine to achieve its goals. This machine produces outcomes. By
comparing the outcomes to the goals, those running the machine can see how well the machine is
working. This is the feedback loop that those who are responsible for the machine need to run well in
order to improve the machine. Based on the feedback, the machine can be adjusted to improve. The
machine consists of two big parts—the culture and the people. If the outcomes are inconsistent with the
goals, something must be wrong with the machine, which means that something must be wrong with the
culture and/or the people. By diagnosing what is wrong, designing improvements and implementing
those improvements, the machine will evolve. In short, the evolutionary process is as follows. Take a
minute to look it over and see what you think.

© 2011 Ray Dalio

38

Part 3: My Management Principles

The more frequently and effectively those in the machine go through this process, the more rapidly they
and the machine will evolve. An effective evolutionary process looks like this—i.e., lots of quality
feedback loops produces a steep upward trajectory.

An ineffective evolutionary process—i.e., one in which mistakes are infrequently looked at and
weaknesses are not well identified—looks like that shown below, i.e., fewer and/or less effective feedback
loops produces a slower upward trajectory. In fact, if there are two few and/or bad quality feedback
loops, there will be a decline because you won’t identify and deal with the problems that will kill you.

I believe that this is equally true for individuals and organizations. I also believe that the most important
difference between great organizations and bad ones is in how well they manage their feedback loops.

39

Part 3: My Management Principles

Bridgewater’s Culture and People
Naturally, the culture and people that I have chosen for Bridgewater are extensions the principles that I
believe work best, which I explained in Part 2. Most importantly I value meaningful work and meaningful
relationships that are obtained by striving for truth and excellence with great people. I am confident that
through this constant striving, we will evolve rapidly together.
As you might have guessed from reading Part 2, I want Bridgewater to be a company in which people
collectively…
…1) work for what they want and not for what others want of them.
…2) come up with the best independent opinions they can muster to move toward their
goals,
…3) stress-test their opinions by having the smartest people they can find to challenge
them so they can find out where they are wrong,
…4) are wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing
…5) wrestle with reality, experiencing the results of their decisions, and reflecting on what
they did to produce them so that they can improve.
And when faced with difficult choices, I want them to see the choices as follows.

40

Part 3: My Management Principles

While I recognize that being this way is challenging, I am also confident that it is what is required to get
the most out of out of life. I am confident for two reasons. First, it is logical that the cause-effect
relationships are such that being this way produces good results. Second, this theory has been tested
over the last 40 years and has worked. While 40 years ago being this way seemed logical, back then that
was an untested theory. Now that we have 40 years of testing to look back on, we can see that the
results verify the theory.

Fleshing Out This Way of Being
The best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what do you want, then ask ‘what is true’—and then ask
yourself ‘what should be done about it.’ I believe that if you do this you will move much faster towards
what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!

41

Part 3: My Management Principles

Because what I have said is pretty abstract, I need to spell out exactly what it means to run a company
this way. I need to get very specific. Over time I have built a collection of principles that encompasses
almost all aspects of managing because I have collected and refined so many over time. I believe that
virtually all problems you might encounter are addressed by one or more of the principles that follow.
There are too many to read as a book. What follows is not a few rules to go by presented in an easily
digestible form that’s easy to remember. That wouldn’t have been specific enough to be of much help to
you. There are over 200 principles here that are well explained and are meant to be used more as a
reference book than a book that is read from cover to cover.
I’ve created an outline that serves the purposes of being both a summary of my management principles
and a table of contents for a more complete explanation of them. Said differently, these principles are
presented in a big picture way in this Summary and Table of Principles and in a more thoroughly
explained way in the section that follows. If you want to understand the principles in brief, just read what’s
said in the summary below and if you want to delve into them, go to the individual principles after the
outline.

played on the field.
f) Watch out for people who think it’s embarrassing not to know.

... 25) Make sure responsible parties are open-minded about the questions and
comments of others.
... 26) Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are
the means by which people determine whether their principles are aligned
and resolve their differences.
a) Expect more open-minded disagreements at Bridgewater than at most other firms.
b) There is giant untapped potential in disagreement, especially if the disagreement is
between two or more thoughtful people

... 27) Know when to stop debating and move on to agreeing about what should be
done.
a) However, when people disagree on the importance of debating something, it should be
debated.
b) Recognize that “there are many good ways to skin a cat.”

decision-maker must view the issue within a broader context.
d) Distinguish between 1) idle complaints and 2) complaints that are meant to lead to
improvement.

... 28) Appreciate that open debate is not meant to create rule by referendum.
... 29) Evaluate whether an issue calls for debate, discussion, or teaching.

a) To avoid confusion, make clear which kind of conversation (debate, discussion, or
teaching) you are having
b) Communication aimed at getting the best answer should involve the most relevant
people.
c) Communication aimed at educating or boosting cohesion should involve a broader set
of people than would be needed if the aim were just getting the best answer.
d) Leverage your communication.

... 30) Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable.

a) A hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with a meritocracy of ideas but essential for
it.

... 31) Consider your own and others’ “believabilities.”

a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion.
b) People who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question and
have great explanations when probed are most believable.
c) If someone asks you a question, think first whether you’re the responsible party/right
person to be answering the question.

... 32) Spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to “getting in synch”
because it’s the best investment you can make.
... 33) If it is your meeting to run, manage the conversation.

operating in a great culture.
... 39) First, match the person to the design.
a) Most importantly, find people who share your values.
b) Look for people who are willing to look at themselves objectively and have character.
c) Conceptual thinking and common sense are required in order to assign someone the

requirements for that job.
... 48) Use personality assessment tests and quality reflections on experiences to
help you identify these differences.
... 49) Understand that different ways of seeing and thinking make people suitable for
different jobs.
a) People are best at the jobs that require what they do well.
b) If you’re not naturally good at one type of thinking, it doesn’t mean you’re precluded
from paths that require that type of thinking

how you and your people are built so you can put the right people in the right
jobs and clearly assign responsibilities.

can identify what you are looking for.
b) Understand how to use and interpret personality assessments.

looking for.
f) Ask for past reviews.
g) Check references.

... 57) Look for people who have lots of great questions.
... 58) Make sure candidates interview you and Bridgewater.

you want to share your life with.
... 60) Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.”
... 61) Hear the click: Find the right fit between the role and the person.
... 62) Pay for the person, not for the job.

the Goal
... 65) Understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not

... 67) Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level.
... 68) Connect the case at hand to your principles for handling cases of that type.

... 91) Know what your people are like, and make sure they do their jobs excellently.
... 92) Constantly probe the people who report to you, and encourage them to probe
you.
a) Remind the people you are probing that problems and mistakes are fuel for
improvement.

... 93) Probe to the level below the people who work for you.
... 94) Remember that few people see themselves objectively, so it’s important to
welcome probing and to probe others.
... 95) Probe so that you have a good enough understanding of whether problems are
likely to occur before they actually do.
a) When a crisis appears to be brewing, contact should be so close that it’s extremely
unlikely that there will be any surprises.

and they don’t take it personally.

... 96) Don’t “pick your battles.” Fight them all.
... 97) Don’t let people off the hook.
... 98) Don’t assume that people’s answers are correct.

document all aspects of a person’s performance. These will help clarify assessments
and communication surrounding them.
b) Maintain “baseball cards” and/or “believability matrixes” for your people.

... 102) Evaluate employees with the same rigor as you evaluate job candidates.
... 103) Know what makes your people tick, because people are your most important
resource.
... 104) Recognize that while most people prefer compliments over criticisms, there is
nothing more valuable than accurate criticisms.

b) Remember that convincing people of their strengths is generally much easier than
convincing them of their weaknesses.
c) Encourage objective reflection
d) Employee reviews:

... 107) Understand that you and the people you manage will go through a process of
personal evolution.
... 108) Recognize that your evolution at Bridgewater should be relatively rapid and a
natural consequence of discovering your strengths and weaknesses; as a
result, your career path is not planned at the outset
... 109) Remember that the only purpose of looking at what people did is to learn
what they are like.
a) Look at patterns of behaviors and don’t read too much into any one event.
b) Don’t believe that being good or bad at some things means that the person is good or
bad at everything.

... 110) If someone is doing their job poorly, consider whether this is due to
inadequate learning (i.e., training/experience) or inadequate ability
... 111) Remember that when it comes to assessing people, the two biggest mistakes
are being overconfident in your assessment and failing to get in synch on
that assessment. Don’t make those mistakes.

b) Learn about your people and have them learn about you with very frank conversations
about mistakes and their root causes.

... 112) Help people through the pain that comes with exploring their weaknesses.
... 113) Recognize that when you are really in synch with people about weaknesses,
whether yours or theirs, they are probably true.

doubt” when judging people.
... 115) Understand that you should be able to learn the most about what a person is
like and whether they are a “click” for the job in their first year.
... 116) Continue assessing people throughout their time at Bridgewater.
117) Train and Test People Through Experiences
... 118) Understand that training is really guiding the process of personal evolution.
... 119) Know that experience creates internalization
... 120) Provide constant feedback to put the learning in perspective
... 121) Remember that everything is a case study.
... 122) Teach your people to fish rather than give them fish.
... 123) Recognize that sometimes it is better to let people make mistakes so that
they can learn from them rather than tell them the better decision.
a) When criticizing, try to make helpful suggestions.

b) Learn from success as well as from failure.

... 124) Know what types of mistakes are acceptable and unacceptable, and don’t
allow the people who work for you to make the unacceptable ones.
... 125) Recognize that behavior modification typically takes about 18 months of
constant reinforcement.
... 126) Train people; don’t rehabilitate them.
a) A common mistake: training and testing a poor performer to see if he or she can
acquire the required skills without simultaneously trying to assess their abilities.

... 127) After you decide “what’s true” (i.e., after you figure out what your people are
like), think carefully about “what to do about it.”
128) Sort People into Other Jobs at Bridgewater, or Remove Them from
Bridgewater
... 129) When you find that someone is not a good “click” for a job, get them out of it
ASAP.
... 130) Know that it is much worse to keep someone in a job who is not suited for it
than it is to fire someone.
... 131) When people are “without a box,” consider whether there is an open box at
Bridgewater that would be a better fit. If not, fire them.
... 132) Do not lower the bar.

To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems…
133) Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively
... 134) Keep in mind the 5-Step Process explained in Part 2.
... 135) Recognize that perceiving problems is the first essential step toward great
management.
... 136) Understand that problems are the fuel for improvement.
... 137) You need to be able to perceive if things are above the bar (i.e., good
enough) or below the bar (i.e., not good enough), and you need to make sure
your people can as well
... 138) Don’t tolerate badness.
... 139) “Taste the soup.”
... 140) Have as many eyes looking for problems as possible.
a) “Pop the cork.”
b) Hold people accountable for raising their complaints.
c) The leader must encourage disagreement and be either impartial or open-minded.
d) The people closest to certain jobs probably know them best, or at least have
perspectives you need to understand, so those people are essential for creating
improvement.

... 141) To perceive problems, compare how the movie is unfolding relative to your
script

... 142) Don’t use the anonymous “we” and “they,” because that masks personal
responsibility—use specific names.
... 143) Be very specific about problems; don’t start with generalizations.
... 144) Tool: Use the following tools to catch problems: issues logs, metrics, surveys,
checklists, outside consultants, and internal auditors.
... 145) The most common reason problems aren’t perceived is what I call the “frog in
the boiling water” problem.
... 146) In some cases, people accept unacceptable problems because they are
perceived as being too difficult to fix. Yet fixing unacceptable problems is
actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make
you miserable.
a) Problems that have good, planned solutions are completely different from those that
don’t.

147) Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of
... 148) Recognize that all problems are just manifestations of their root causes, so
diagnose to understand what the problems are symptomatic of.
... 149) Understand that diagnosis is foundational both to progress and quality
relationships.
... 150) Ask the following questions when diagnosing.
... 151) Remember that a root cause is not an action but a reason.
... 152) Identify at which step failure occurred in the 5-Step Process.
... 153) Remember that a proper diagnosis requires a quality, collaborative, and
honest discussion to get at the truth.
... 154) Keep in mind that diagnoses should produce outcomes.
... 155) Don’t make too much out of one “dot”—synthesize a richer picture by
squeezing lots of “dots” quickly and triangulating with others.
... 156) Maintain an emerging synthesis by diagnosing continuously
... 157) To distinguish between a capacity issue and a capability issue, imagine how
the person would perform at that particular function if they had ample
capacity.
... 158) The most common reasons managers fail to produce excellent results or
escalate are
... 159) Avoid “Monday morning quarterbacking.”
... 160) Identify the principles that were violated.
... 161) Remember that if you have the same people doing the same things, you
should expect the same results.
... 162) Use the following “drilldown” technique to gain an 80/20 understanding of a
department or sub-department that is having problems.
163) Put Things in Perspective

a) Tool: Have all new employees listen to tapes of “the story” to bring them up to date.

... 165) Understand “above the line” and “below the line” thinking and how to navigate
between the two.
166) Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals
... 167) Remember: You are designing a “machine” or system that will produce
outcomes.
a) A short-term goal probably won’t require you to build a machine.
b) Beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and not enough
attention to what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve
your goals.

... 168) Don’t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan
... 169) The organizational design you draw up should minimize problems and
maximize capitalization on opportunities.
... 170) Put yourself in the “position of pain” for a while so that you gain a richer
understanding of what you’re designing for.
... 171) Recognize that design is an iterative process; between a bad “now” and a
good “then” is a “working through it” period.
... 172) Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose.
... 173) Think about second- and third-order consequences as well as first-order
consequences.
... 174) Most importantly, build the organization around goals rather than tasks.

a) First come up with the best workflow design, sketch it out in an organizational chart,
visualize how the parts interact, specify what qualities are required for each job, and,
only after that is done, choose the right people to fill the jobs
b) Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings.
c) Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the
resources they need to achieve the goals.
d) The efficiency of an organization decreases and the bureaucracy of an organization
increases in direct relation to the increase in the number of people and/or the
complexity of the organization.

... 175) Build your organization from the top down.

a) Everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards.
b) The people at the top of each pyramid should have the skills and focus to manage
their direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs.
c) The ratio of senior managers to junior managers and to the number of people who
work two levels below should be limited, to preserve quality communication and
mutual understanding.
d) The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to their direct
reports will limit the size of an effective organization.
e) The larger the organization, the more important are 1) information technology
expertise in management and 2) cross-department communication (more on these
later).
f) Do not build the organization to fit the people.

... 176) Have the clearest possible delineation of responsibilities and reporting lines.
a) Create an organizational chart to look like a pyramid, with straight lines down that don’t
cross.

... 177) Constantly think about how to produce leverage.

a) You should be able to delegate the details away.
b) It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to
have a greater number of ordinary and less well-equipped people.
c) Use “leveragers.”

... 178) Understand the clover-leaf design.
... 179) Don’t do work for people in another department or grab people from another
department to do work for you unless you speak to the boss.
... 180) Watch out for “department slip.”
... 181) Assign responsibilities based on workflow design and people’s abilities, not
job titles.
... 182) Watch out for consultant addiction.
... 183) Tool: Maintain a procedures manual.
... 184) Tool: Use checklists.
a) Don’t confuse checklists with personal responsibility.
b) Remember that “systematic” doesn’t necessarily mean computerized.
c) Use “double-do” rather than “double-check” to make sure mission-critical tasks are
done correctly.

... 185) Watch out for “job slip.”
... 186) Think clearly how things should go, and when they aren’t going that way,
acknowledge it and investigate
... 187) Have good controls so that you are not exposed to the dishonesty of others
and trust is never an issue.
a) People doing auditing should report to people outside the department being audited,
and auditing procedures should not be made known to those being audited.
b) Remember: There is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors).

188) Do What You Set Out to Do
... 189) Push through!

To Make Decisions Effectively…
190) Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with Not Knowing
... 191) Recognize that your goal is to come up with the best answer, that the
probability of your having it is small, and that even if you have it, you can’t be
confident that you do have it unless you have other believable people test
you.
... 192) Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is far more powerful than
knowing
a) Embrace the power of asking: “What don’t I know, and what should I do about it?”

Part 3: My Management Principles

b) Finding the path to success is at least as dependent on coming up with the right
questions as coming up with answers.

... 193) Remember that your goal is to find the best answer, not to give the best one
you have.
... 194) While everyone has the right to have questions and theories, only believable
people have the right to have opinions
... 195) Constantly worry about what you are missing.
a) Successful people ask for the criticism of others and consider its merit.
b) Triangulate your view.

196) Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value Calculations
... 197) Considering both the probabilities and the payoffs of the consequences,
make sure that the probability of the unacceptable (i.e., the risk of ruin) is nil.
a) The cost of a bad decision is equal to or greater than the reward of a good decision, so
knowing what you don’t know is at least as valuable as knowing.
b) Recognize opportunities where there isn’t much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the
probability of the gain happening is low.
c) Understand how valuable it is to raise the probability that your decision will be right by
accurately assessing the probability of your being right.
d) Don’t bet too much on anything. Make 15 or more good, uncorrelated bets.

198) Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is
... 199) Distinguish the important things from the unimportant things and deal with the
important things first.
a) Don’t be a perfectionist
b) Since 80% of the juice can be gotten with the first 20% of the squeezing, there are
relatively few (typically less than five) important things to consider in making a
decision.
c) Watch out for “detail anxiety,”
d) Don’t mistake small things for unimportant things, because some small things can be
very important

... 200) Think about the appropriate time to make a decision in light of the marginal
gains made by acquiring additional information versus the marginal costs of
postponing the decision.
... 201) Make sure all the “must do’s” are above the bar before you do anything else.
... 202) Remember that the best choices are the ones with more pros than cons, not
those that don’t have any cons. Watch out for people who tend to argue
against something because they can find something wrong with it without
properly weighing all the pros against the cons.
... 203) Watch out for unproductively identifying possibilities without assigning them
probabilities, because it screws up prioritization.
... 204) Understand the concept and use the phrase “by and large.”
a) When you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that “It’s not totally
true,” it’s probably true enough.

What Follows is the Meat…

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the Culture Right
Trust in Truth

To Get the Culture Right…
1) Trust in Truth
So…
... 2) Realize that you have nothing to fear from truth. Understanding, accepting, and

knowing how to effectively deal with reality are crucial for achieving success. Having truth on your
side is extremely powerful. While the truth itself may be scary—you have a weakness, you have a
deadly disease, etc.—knowing the truth will allow you to deal with your situation better. Being
truthful, and letting others be truthful with you, allows you to explore your own thoughts and
exposes you to the feedback that is essential for your learning. Being truthful is an extension of
your freedom to be you; people who are one way on the inside and another on the outside become
conflicted and often lose touch with their own values. It’s difficult for them to be happy, and almost
impossible for them to be at their best. While the first-order effects of being radically truthful might
not be desirable, the second- and third-order effects are great.
Do you agree with this?

... 3) Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what
makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without
speaking up about it.
... 4) Be extremely open. Openness leads to truth and trust. Being open about what you dislike is

especially important, because things you don’t like need to be changed or resolved. Discuss your
issues until you are in synch or until you understand each other’s positions and can determine what
should be done. As someone I worked with once explained, “It’s simple - just don’t filter.” The main
reason Bridgewater performs well is that all people here have the power to speak openly and
equally and because their views are judged on the merits of what they are saying. Through that
extreme openness and a meritocracy of thought, we identify and solve problems better. Since we
know we can rely on honesty, we succeed more and we ultimately become closer, and since we
succeed and are close, we are more committed to this mission and to each other. It is a selfreinforcing, virtuous cycle.
Do you agree with this?

... 5) Have integrity and demand it from others. Integrity comes from the Latin word integer,

meaning “one.” People who are one way on the inside and another way outside lack integrity; they
have duality.
The second- and third-order effects of having integrity and avoiding duality are great. Thinking
solely about what’s accurate instead of how it is perceived helps you to be more focused on
important things. It helps you sort the people you are around and the environments you are in. It
improves the organization’s efficiency and camaraderie because the secret things that people think
and don't say to each other drive resentment and key issues underground and don’t lead to
improvement. Having nothing to hide relieves stress. It also builds trust. For these reasons:
5a) Never say anything about a person you wouldn’t say to them directly, and don’t try
people without accusing them to their face. Badmouthing people behind their backs

Part 3: My Management Principles

Trust in Truth
shows a serious lack of integrity and is counterproductive. It doesn’t yield any beneficial
change, and it subverts both the people you are badmouthing and the environment as a
whole. Next to being dishonest, it is the worst thing you can do at Bridgewater. Criticism is
both welcomed and encouraged at Bridgewater, so there is no good reason to talk behind
people’s backs. You need to follow this policy to an extreme degree. For example, managers
should not talk about people who work for them without those people being in the room. If
you talk behind people’s backs at Bridgewater you are called a slimy weasel.
5b) Don’t let “loyalty” stand in the way of truth and openness. In some companies,
employees hide their employer’s mistakes, and employers do the same in return. In these
places, openly expressing your concerns is considered disloyal, and discouraged. Because it
prevents people from bringing their mistakes and weaknesses to the surface and because it
encourages deception and eliminates the subordinates’ right of appeal, unhealthy loyalty
stands in the way of improvement. I believe in a truer, healthier form of loyalty, which does
the opposite. Healthy loyalty fosters improvement through openly addressing mistakes and
weaknesses. The more people are open about their challenges, the more helpful others can
be. In an environment in which mistakes and weaknesses are dealt with frankly, those who
face their challenges have the most admirable character. By contrast, when mistakes and
weaknesses are hidden, unhealthy character is legitimized.

... 6) Be radically transparent. Provide people with as much exposure as possible to what’s going
on around them. Allowing people direct access lets them form their own views and greatly
enhances accuracy and the pursuit of truth. Winston Churchill said, “There is no worse course in
leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.” The candid question-and-answer
process allows people to probe your thinking. You can then modify your thinking to get at the best
possible answer, reinforcing your confidence that you’re on the best possible path.

6a) Record almost all meetings and share them with all relevant people. Provide tapes of all
meetings that don’t contain confidential information to enhance transparency. Of course,
there are some times when privacy is required. If someone gives you confidential information,
keep it confidential until you have permission to disclose it.

... 7) Don’t tolerate dishonesty. People typically aren’t totally honest, which stands in the way of

progress, so don’t tolerate this. There’s an adjustment process at Bridgewater in which one learns
to be completely honest and expect the same from others. Increasingly you engage in logical,
unemotional discussions in pursuit of truth in which criticisms are not viewed as attacks, but as
explorations of possible sources of problems.
7a) Don’t believe it when someone caught being dishonest says they have seen the light
and will never do that sort of thing again. Chances are they will. The cost of keeping
someone around who has been dishonest is likely to be higher than any benefits.

but Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn
From Them
So…
... 9) Recognize that effective, innovative thinkers are going to make mistakes 49
and learn from them because it is a natural part of the innovation process.

For every mistake that you learn from you will save thousands of similar mistakes in the future, so if
you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that yield rapid improvements you should be excited by
them. But if you treat them as bad things, you will make yourself and others miserable, and you
won’t grow. Your work environment will be marked by petty back-biting and malevolent barbs rather
than by a healthy, honest search for truth that leads to evolution and improvement. Because of this,
the more mistakes you make and the more quality, honest diagnoses you have, the more rapid
your progress will be. That’s not B.S. or just talk. That’s the reality of learning. 50

... 10) Do not feel bad about your mistakes or those of others. Love them!

Remember that 1) they are to be expected, 2) they’re the first and most essential part of the
learning process, and 3) feeling bad about them will prevent you from getting better. People
typically feel bad about mistakes because they think in a short-sighted way that mistakes reflect
their badness or because they’re worried about being punished (or not being rewarded). People
also tend to get angry at those who make mistakes because in a short-sighted way they focus on
the bad outcome rather than the educational, evolutionary process they’re a part of. That’s a real
tragedy.
I once had a ski instructor who had taught Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all
time, how to ski. He explained that Jordan enjoyed his mistakes and got the most out of them. At
the start of high school, Jordan was an unimpressive basketball player; he became a champion
because he loved using his mistakes to improve. Yet despite Jordan’s example and the example of
countless other successful people, it is far more common for people to allow ego to stand in the
way of learning. Perhaps it’s because school learning overemphasizes the value of having the right
answers and punishes wrong answers. Good school learners are often bad mistake-based learners
because they are bothered by their mistakes. I particularly see this problem in recent graduates
from the best colleges, who frequently shy away from exploring their own weaknesses. Remember
that intelligent people who are open to recognizing and learning from their weaknesses
substantially outperform people with the same abilities who aren’t similarly open.

... 11) Observe the patterns of mistakes to see if they are a product of
weaknesses. Connect the dots without ego barriers. If there is a pattern of mistakes, it probably

signifies a weakness. Everyone has weaknesses. The fastest path to success is to know what they
are and how to deal with them so that they don’t stand in your way. Weaknesses are due to
deficiencies in learning or deficiencies in abilities. Deficiencies in learning can be rectified over

Thomas Edison said about failure: “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” “I am not discouraged,
because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.” “Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several
thousand things that won’t work.” “When I have fully decided that a result is worth getting I go ahead of it and make trial after trial
until it comes.” “Many of life’s failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.”

time, though usually not quickly, while deficiencies in abilities are virtually impossible to change.
Neither is a meaningful impediment to getting what you want if you accept it as a problem that can
be designed around.

... 12) Do not feel bad about your weaknesses or those of others. They are

opportunities to improve. If you can solve the puzzle of what is causing them, you will get a gem i.e., the ability to stop making them in the future. Everyone has weaknesses and can benefit from
knowing about them. Don’t view explorations of weaknesses as attacks. A person who receives
criticism - particularly if he tries to objectively consider if it’s true - is someone to be admired.

... 13) Don’t worry about looking good - worry about achieving your goals. Put your
insecurities away and get on with achieving your goals.

To test if you are worrying too much about looking good, observe how you feel when you find out
you’ve made a mistake or don’t know something. If you find yourself feeling bad, reflect - remind
yourself that the most valuable comments are accurate criticisms. Imagine how silly and
unproductive it would be if you thought your ski instructor was blaming you when he told you that
you fell because you didn’t shift your weight properly. If a criticism is accurate, it is a good thing.
You should appreciate it and try to learn from it.

... 14) Get over “blame” and “credit” and get on with “accurate” and “inaccurate.”
When people hear, “You did XYZ wrong,” they have an instinctual reaction to figure out possible
consequences or punishments rather than to try to understand how to improve. Remember that
what has happened lies in the past and no longer matters, except as a method for learning how to
be better in the future. Create an environment in which people understand that remarks such as
“You handled that badly” are meant to be helpful (for the future) rather than punitive (for the past).
While people typically feel unhappy about blame and good about credit, that attitude gets
everything backwards and can cause major problems. Worrying about “blame” and “credit” or
“positive” and “negative” feedback impedes the iterative process essential to learning.

... 15) Don’t depersonalize mistakes. Identifying who made mistakes is essential to learning. It

is also a test of whether a person will put improvement ahead of ego and whether he will fit into the
Bridgewater culture. A common error is to say, “We didn’t handle this well” rather than “Harry didn’t
handle this well.” This occurs when people are uncomfortable connecting specific mistakes to
specific people because of ego sensitivities. This creates dysfunctional and dishonest
organizations. Since individuals are the most important building blocks of any organization and
since individuals are responsible for the ways things are done, the diagnosis must connect the
mistake to the specific individual by name. Someone created the procedure that went wrong, or
decided we should act according to that procedure, and ignoring that fact will slow our progress
toward successfully dealing with the problem.

... 16) Write down your weaknesses and the weaknesses of others to help
remember and acknowledge them. It’s unhealthy to hide them because if you hide them,
it will slow your progress towards successfully dealing with them. Conversely, if you don’t want
them and you stare at them, you will inevitably evolve past them.

... 17) When you experience pain, remember to reflect. You can convert the “pain” of

seeing your mistakes and weaknesses into pleasure. If there is only one piece of advice I can get
you to remember it is this one. Calm yourself down and think about what is causing your

© 2011 Ray Dalio

59

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the Culture Right
Create a Culture in Which It Is OK to Make Mistakes but
Unacceptable Not to Identify, Analyze, and Learn From Them
psychological pain. Ask other objective, believable parties for their help to figure it out. Find out
what is true. Don’t let ego barriers stand in your way. Remember that pains that come from seeing
51
mistakes and weaknesses are “growing pains” that you learn from. Don’t rush through them. Stay
in them and explore them because that will help build the foundation for improvement. It is widely
recognized that 1) changing your deep-seated, harmful behavior is very difficult yet necessary for
improvement and 2) doing this generally requires a deeply felt recognition of the connection
between your harmful behavior and the pain it causes. Psychologists call this “hitting bottom.”
Embracing your failures is the first step toward genuine improvement; it is also why “confession”
precedes forgiveness in many societies. 52 If you keep doing this you will learn to improve and feel
the pleasures of it.

... 18) Be self-reflective and make sure your people are self-reflective. This quality

differentiates those who evolve fast from those who don’t. When there is pain, the animal instinct is
‘fight or flight’ (i.e., to either strike back or run away) - reflect instead. When you can calm yourself
down, thinking about the dilemma that is causing you pain will bring you to a higher level and
enlighten you, leading to progress. That is because the pain you are feeling is due to something
being at odds - maybe it’s you encountering reality, such as the death of a friend, and not being
able to accept it. If when you are calm, you can think clearly about what things are at odds, you will
learn more about what reality is like and how to better deal with it. It really will produce progress. If,
on the other hand, the pain causes you to tense-up, not think, feel sorry for yourself, and blame
others, it will be a very bad experience. So, when you are in pain, try to remember: Pain +
Reflection = Progress. It’s pretty easy to determine whether a person is reflective or deflective: selfreflective people openly and objectively look at themselves while deflective people don’t.

... 19) Teach and reinforce the merits of mistake-based learning. We must bring

mistakes into the open and analyze them objectively, so managers need to foster a culture that
makes this normal and penalizes suppressing or covering up mistakes. Probably the worst mistake
anyone can make at Bridgewater is not facing up to mistakes - i.e., hiding rather than highlighting
them. Highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the
future, and then adding that new knowledge to the procedures manual are all essential to our
improvement.
19a) The most valuable tool we have for this is the issues log (explained fully later), which
is aimed at identifying and learning from mistakes. Using this tool is mandatory because
we believe that enforcing this behavior is far better than leaving it optional.

51
If you recognize short-term failure as a step toward long-term success, which it really is if you learn from it, you won’t be afraid of it
or made uncomfortable by it and you will approach all of your experiences as learning experiences, even the most difficult ones.
52
Ego often stands in the way of acknowledging your weaknesses (which is the essential first step in overcoming them), like being
afraid to ask a question because people might think you’re stupid because you don’t know something. Yet acknowledging those
weaknesses (e.g., “I know I‘m a dumb shit, but I’d just like to know…”) helps you move beyond ego toward learning and improving.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the Culture Right
Constantly Get in Synch

20) Constantly Get in Synch
So…
... 21) Constantly get in synch about what is true and what to do about it. Getting in

synch helps you achieve better answers through considering alternative viewpoints. It can take the
forms of asking, debating, discussing, and teaching how things should be done. Sometimes it is to
make our views on our strengths, weaknesses, and values transparent in order to reach the
understanding that helps us move forward. Sometimes it is to be clear about who will do what and
the game plan for handling responsibilities. So this process can be both a means of finding the best
answers and pushing them ahead. Quality conversations about what is true and what should be
done will produce better outcomes and many fewer misunderstandings in the future.

... 22) Talk about “Is it true?” and “Does it make sense?” In a culture that values both

independent thinking and innovation, each individual has both the right and the obligation to ensure
that what they do, and what we collectively do, in pursuit of excellence, makes sense to them. So,
get in synch about these things.

... 23) Fight for right. Discuss or debate important issues with the right relevant parties in an open-

minded way until the best answers are determined. This process will maximize learning and mutual
understanding. Thrash it out to get to the best answer.

... 24) Be assertive and open-minded at the same time. Just try to find out what is true.

Don’t try to ‘win’ the argument. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being
right, because you are learning.
24a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. Opinions are easy
to produce, so bad ones abound. Knowing that you don’t know something is nearly as
valuable as knowing it. The worst situation is thinking you know something when you don’t.
24b) Recognize that you always have the right to have and ask questions.
24c) Distinguish open-minded people from closed-minded people. Open-minded people
seek to learn by asking questions; they realize that what they know is little in relation to what
there is to know and recognize that they might be wrong. Closed-minded people always tell
you what they know, even if they know hardly anything about the subject being discussed.
They are typically made uncomfortable by being around those who know a lot more about a
subject, unlike open-minded people who are thrilled by such company.
24d) Don’t have anything to do with closed-minded, inexperienced people. They won’t do
you any good and there’s no helping them until they open their minds, so they will waste your
time in the meantime. If you must deal with them, the first thing you have to do is open their
minds. Being open-minded is far more important than being bright or smart.
24e) Be wary of the arrogant intellectual who comments from the stands without having
played on the field. And avoid that trap yourself.
24f) Watch out for people who think it’s embarrassing not to know. They’re dangerous.

... 25) Make sure responsible parties are open-minded about the questions and
comments of others. They are required to explain the thinking behind a decision openly and
transparently so that all can understand and assess it. Further, in the event of disagreement, an

61

Part 3: My Management Principles

appeal should be made to either the manager’s boss or an agreed-upon, knowledgeable group of
others, generally including people more believable than and senior to the decision-maker. The
person(s) resolving the dispute must do this objectively and fairly; otherwise our system will fail at
maintaining its meritocracy of ideas.

... 26) Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they
are the means by which people determine whether their principles are
aligned and resolve their differences. I believe that in all relationships, including the

most treasured ones, 1) there are principles and values each person has that must be in synch for
the relationship to be successful and 2) there must be give and take. I believe there is always a
kind of negotiation or debate between people based on principles and mutual consideration. What
you learn about each other via that “negotiation” either draws you together or drives you apart. If
your principles are aligned and you can work out your differences via a process of give and take,
you will draw closer together. If not, you will move apart. It is through such open discussion,
especially when it comes to contentious issues, that people can make sure there are no
misunderstandings. If that open discussion of differences doesn’t happen on an ongoing basis, the
gaps in perspectives will widen until inevitably there is a major clash. Ironically, people who
suppress the mini-confrontations for fear of conflict tend to have huge conflicts later, which can
lead to separation, precisely because they let minor problems fester. On the other hand, people
who address the mini-conflicts head-on in order to straighten things out tend to have the great,
long-lasting relationships. That’s why I believe people should feel free to say whatever they really
think.
26a) Expect more open-minded disagreements at Bridgewater than at most other firms.
They fuel the learning that helps us be at our best. Sometimes when there are
disagreements, people get angry. But you should remind them that the management at most
other companies doesn’t welcome disagreement or encourage open debate. As a result,
there is less of both. So instead of getting angry, they should welcome the fact that
disagreements and open debate are encouraged here.
26b) There is giant untapped potential in disagreement, especially if the disagreement is
between two or more thoughtful people - yet most people either avoid it or they make it an
unproductive fight. That’s tragic. 53

... 27) Know when to stop debating and move on to agreeing about what should
be done. I have seen people who agree on the major issues waste hours arguing over details.

It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. Be wary of bogging down
amid minor issues at the expense of time devoted to solidifying important agreements.
27a) However, when people disagree on the importance of debating something, it should
be debated. Operating otherwise would essentially give someone (typically the boss) a de
facto veto right.
27b) Recognize that “there are many good ways to skin a cat.” Your assessment of how
responsible parties are doing their jobs should not be based on whether they’re doing it your

53

Most people have a tough time disagreeing about the most trivial things, like whether they like the same restaurant, yet are happy
to confidently express their opinions, however badly they are formed, if they get them out first. As a result, there is an
overabundance of confident bad opinions around and very few thoughtful conclusions arising from learning from each other. It is
common for conversations to be exchanges of sentences that begin “I think…” followed by their conclusions, and both parties
believing that they had a good conversation and feeling good about each other, even though nothing was accomplished. If most
people did the opposite—i.e., if they sought out and open-mindedly explored their disagreements—it would produce a radical
increase in learning, and the world would be a much better place.

way but whether they’re doing it in a good way.
27c) For disagreements to have a positive effect, people evaluating an individual decision
or decision-maker must view the issue within a broader context. For example, if the
responsible party being challenged has a vision, and the decision under disagreement
involves a small detail, evaluate the decision within the context of the broader vision. The
ensuing discussion resulting from challenging someone’s decision will help people
understand all the considerations behind it.
27d) Distinguish between 1) idle complaints and 2) complaints that are meant to lead to
improvement.

... 28) Appreciate that open debate is not meant to create rule by referendum. It is

meant to provide the decision-maker with alternative perspectives in anticipation of a better
answer. It can also be used to enhance understanding of others’ views and abilities and, over time,
assess whether someone should be assigned a responsibility. It doesn’t mean there can’t be some
designs in which a group oversees a person. But that’s designed and embedded in the
organizational structure, specifying the people responsible for oversight who are chosen because
of their knowledge and judgment.

... 29) Evaluate whether an issue calls for debate, discussion, or teaching. Debate,

discussion, and teaching are all ways of getting in synch, but they work differently and the
approach you choose should reflect your goal and the relative believability of the people involved.
Debate is generally among approximate equals; discussion is open-minded exploration among
people of various levels of understanding; and teaching is between people of different levels of
understanding.
29a) To avoid confusion, make clear which kind of conversation (debate, discussion, or
teaching) you are having and recognize that the purpose is ultimately to get at truth, not to
prove that someone is right or wrong.
29b) Communication aimed at getting the best answer should involve the most relevant
people. Not everyone should randomly probe everyone else, because that’s an unproductive
waste of time. People should consider their own levels of believability and understanding to
assess if the probing makes sense. As a guide, the most relevant people are your managers,
direct reports, and/or agreed experts. They are the most impacted by and most informed
about the issues under discussion, and so they are the most important parties to be in synch
with. If you can’t get in synch, you should escalate the disagreement.
29c) Communication aimed at educating or boosting cohesion should involve a broader
set of people than would be needed if the aim were just getting the best answer. Less
experienced, less believable people will be included. They may not be necessary to decide
an issue, but if you aren’t in synch with them, that lack of understanding will likely undermine
morale and the organization’s efficiency. In cases where you have people who are both not
believable and highly opinionated (the worst combination), you will drive their uninformed
opinions underground if you don’t get in synch. Conversely, if you are willing to be
challenged, and others behave the same way, you can demand that all critical
communication be done openly.
Imagine if a group of us were trying to learn how to play golf with Tiger Woods, and he and a
new golfer were debating how to swing the club. Would it be helpful or harmful to our
progress to ignore their different track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful
and plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have different levels of
believability. It is better to listen to what Tiger Woods has to say, without constant
interruptions by some know-nothing arguing with him. While I believe this is true, it would be
© 2011 Ray Dalio

63

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the Culture Right
Constantly Get in Synch
most productive if Tiger Woods gave his instructions and then answered questions. However,
because I’m pretty extreme in believing that it is important to obtain understanding rather than
accepting doctrine at face value, I also think the new golfer shouldn’t accept what Tiger
Woods has to say as right only because he has won loads of tournaments and has years of
experience playing golf. In other words, I believe the new golfer shouldn’t stop questioning
Tiger until he is confident he has found truth. At the same time, I also think the new golfer
would be pretty dumb and arrogant to believe he’s probably right and the champion golfer is
wrong. So he should approach his questioning with that perspective rather than overblown
confidence. It would be really bad for the group’s learning if all the people in the group treated
what the new golfer and Tiger Woods had to say as equally valuable. I feel exactly the same
way about getting at truth at Bridgewater. While it’s good to be open-minded and questioning,
it’s dumb to treat the views of people with great track records and experience the same as
those without track records and experience.
29d) Leverage your communication. While open communication is very important, the
challenge is figuring out how to do it in a time-efficient way. It is helpful to use leveraging
techniques like open e-mails posted on a FAQ board. If the reporting ratios are organized as
described in the principles on organizational design, there should be ample time for this. The
challenges become greater the higher you go in the reporting hierarchy because the number
of people affected by your actions and who have opinions and/or questions grows larger than
just two reporting levels down. In such cases, you will need even greater leverage and
prioritization (e.g., having some of the questions answered by a well-equipped party who
works for you, asking people to prioritize their questions by urgency or importance, etc).

... 30) Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable. Almost everyone has an opinion, but

many are worthless or harmful. The views of people without track records are not equal to the
views of people with strong track records. Treating all people equally is more likely to lead away
from truth than toward it. People without records of success who are nonetheless confident about
how things should be done are either naïve or arrogant. In either case, they’re potentially
dangerous to themselves and others. However, all views should be considered in an open-minded
way, albeit placed in the proper context of experience and track record. Ultimately, the proof is in
the pudding: can you handle your responsibilities well? As a general rule, if you can, then you can
have an opinion of how to do it—if you can’t, you can’t.
30a) A hierarchy of merit is not only consistent with a meritocracy of ideas but essential
for it. Not only is better decision-making enhanced, so is time management. It’s not possible
for everyone to debate everything all the time and still get work done effectively.

... 31) Consider your own and others’ “believabilities.” By believability, I mean the

probability that a person’s view will be right. While we can never know this precisely, we can
roughly assess it according to the quality of a person’s reasoning and their track record. Of course,
different people will have different views of their own and other’s believability, which is fine. Just
recognize that this is a reality that is relevant in a number of ways. Ask, “Why should I believe
you?” and “Why should I believe myself?”
31a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. As a general rule, if
you have a demonstrated track record, then you can have an opinion of how to do it—if you
don’t, you can’t, though you can have theories and questions.
31b) People who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question and
have great explanations when probed are most believable. Those with one of those two
qualities are somewhat believable; people with neither are least believable.
At the same time, people’s ideas should always be assessed on their merit in order to

64

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the Culture Right

encourage them to always think in an open-minded way. I have seen that inexperienced
people can have great ideas, sometimes far better than more experienced people, though
often much worse. So we must be attuned to both the good and the bad and allow people to
build their own track records and their own level of believability. Because of Bridgewater’s
radical openness, you can see how we make our assessments of that.
Someone new who doesn’t know much, has little believability, or isn’t confident in his views
should ask questions. On the other hand, a highly believable person with experience and a
good track record who is highly confident in his views should be assertive. Everyone should
be upfront in expressing how confident they are in their thoughts. A suggestion should be
called a suggestion; a firmly held conviction should be presented as such. Don’t make the
mistake of being a dumb shit with a confident opinion.
31c) If someone asks you a question, think first whether you’re the responsible party/right
person to be answering the question.

... 32) Spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to “getting in synch”
because it’s the best investment you can make. You will inevitably need to prioritize
because of time constraints, but beware of the tremendous price of skimping on quality
communication.

... 33) If it is your meeting to run, manage the conversation. There are many reasons

why meetings go poorly, but frequently it is because of a lack of clarity about the topic or the level
at which things are being discussed (e.g., the principle/machine level, the case at hand level, or the
specific fact level). To manage the meetings well:
33a) Make it clear who the meeting is meant to serve and who is directing the meeting.
Every meeting is for the purpose of meeting someone’s goals; that person is the responsible
party for the meeting and decides what s/he wants to get out of it and how s/he will do so.
Meetings without a clear responsible party run a high risk of being directionless and
unproductive.
33b) Make clear what type of communication you are going to have in light of the
objectives and priorities. For example, if the goal of the meeting is to have people with
different opinions work through their differences to try to get closer to what is true and what to
do about it (i.e., open-minded debate), you will run it differently than if the meeting is meant to
educate. Debating issues takes time. That time increases geometrically depending on the
number of people participating in the discussion, so you have to carefully choose the right
people in the right numbers to suit the decision that needs to be made. In any discussion try
to limit the participation to those whom you value most in light of your objectives. The worst
way to pick people is based on whether their conclusions align with yours.
33c) Lead the discussion by being assertive and open-minded. Group-think and solo-think
are both dangerous.
33d) A small group (3 to 5) of smart, conceptual people seeking the right answers in an
open-minded way will generally lead to the best answer. Next best is to have decisions
made by a single smart, conceptual decision-maker, but this is a much worse choice than the
former. The worst way to make decisions is via large groups without a smart, conceptual
leader. Almost everyone thinks they’re smart and conceptual, but only a small percentage of
any group really is. Even when there is a large number of smart, conceptual leaders, more
than five trying to make a decision is very inefficient and difficult. This is especially the case
when people think they need to satisfy everyone.

33e) 1+1=3. Two people who collaborate well will be about three times as effective as the two of
them operating independently because they will see what the other might miss, they can
leverage each other, and they can hold each other to higher standards. This symbiotic
relationship of adding people to a group will have incremental benefits (2+1=4.25) up to a
point at which there are no incremental gains and beyond which adding people produces
incremental losses in effectiveness. That is because 1) the marginal benefits diminish as the
group gets larger—e.g. two or three people might be able to cover most of the important
perspectives so adding more people doesn't bring much more, and 2) larger group
interactions are less efficient than smaller group interactions. Of course, what's best in
practice is a function of 1) the quality of the people and the differences of the perspectives
that they bring and 2) how well the group is managed. As noted before, each group should
have someone who is responsible for managing the flow to get out of the meeting the most
possible.
33f) Navigate the levels of the conversation clearly. When considering an issue or situation,
there should be two levels of discussion: the case at hand and the relevant principles that
help you decide how the machine should work. Since the case at hand is a manifestation of
one or more relevant principles, you need to clearly navigate between these levels in order to
1) handle the case well, 2) improve the machine so that future cases like this will be handled
better in the future, and 3) test the effectiveness of your principles.
33g) Watch out for “topic slip.” Topic slip is the random and inconclusive drifting from topic to
topic without achieving completion. Tip: Avoid topic slip by tracking the conversation on a
whiteboard so everyone can see where you are.
33h) Enforce the logic of conversations. There is a tendency for people’s emotions to heat up
when there is a disagreement, so focusing on the logic of your exchange will facilitate
communication. If you are calm and analytical in listening to others’ points of view, it is more
difficult for them to shut down a logical exchange than if you get emotional or allow them to
get emotional.
33i) Worry about substance more than style. This is not to say that some styles aren’t more
effective than others with different people and in different circumstances, but don’t let style or
tone prevent you from getting in synch. I often see people complain about the delivery of a
criticism in order to deflect from its substance. If you think someone’s style is an issue, box it
as a separate issue to get in synch about (start by asking whether it’s true and whether it’s
important).
33j) Achieve completion in conversations. The main purpose of discussion is to achieve
completion and get in synch, which leads to decisions and or actions. Conversations often fail
to reach completion. This amounts to a waste of time because they don’t result in conclusions
or productive actions. When there is an exchange of ideas, especially if there is a
disagreement, it is important to end it by stating the conclusions. If there is agreement, say it;
if not, say that. Where further action has been decided, get those tasks on a to-do list, assign
people to do them, and specify due dates. Write down your conclusions, working theories,
and to-do’s in places that will lead to their being used as foundations for continued progress.
33k) Have someone assigned to maintain notes in meetings and make sure follow-through
happens. Generally speaking, to avoid distraction during the discussion itself, prioritizing
follow-ups and assignments should be done afterwards.
33l) Be careful not to lose personal responsibility via group decision-making. Too often
groups will make a decision to do something without assigning personal responsibilities so it
is not clear who is supposed to do what. Be clear in assigning personal responsibilities.

... 34) Make sure people don’t confuse their right to complain, give advice, and
debate with the right to make decisions. Discussion does not mean rule by referendum.

While our culture is marked by extreme openness, some people mistakenly assume we have group
decision-making in which all views are treated equally and consensus rules. Since not all views are
equally valuable, I don’t believe in consensus decision-making or referendums. We operate not
only by open debate but also by clearly assigning personal responsibility to specific people. While
these two values might seem at odds, personal responsibility and open debate work together to
synthesize effective decision-making at Bridgewater. Everyone does not report to everyone here.
Instead, responsibility and authority are assigned to individuals based on our assessment of their
ability to handle them. I want the most capable individuals assigned to each job. We hold them
accountable for their outcomes, but we also give them the authority to achieve those outcomes. It
is perfectly okay for a responsible party to carry through a decision he thinks is best even when
others who are knowledgeable disagree, although this disagreement should be considered and
weighed seriously. We have, and should have, an explicit decision-making hierarchy, ideally based
on merit. 54

... 35) Recognize that getting in synch is a two-way responsibility. In any conversation

there is a responsibility to transmit and a responsibility to receive. Misinterpretations are going to
take place. Often, difficulty in communication is due to people having different ways of thinking
(e.g., left-brained thinkers talking to right-brained thinkers). The parties involved should 1) realize
that what they might be transmitting or receiving might not be what was meant, 2) consider multiple
possibilities, and 3) do a back and forth so that they can get in synch. People do the opposite —
confidently thinking that they’ve communicated their intent clearly, not considering multiple
possibilities and then blaming the other parties for the misunderstanding. Learn lessons from your
problems in communications to improve.

... 36) Escalate if you can’t get in synch. If you can’t understand or reconcile points of view

with someone else, agree on a third party to provide guidance. This person could be your manager
or another agreed-upon, believable person or group who can resolve the conflict objectively, fairly,
and sensibly. This mechanism is a key element of our culture and crucial for maintaining a
meritocracy of ideas.

54

In fact, I once toyed with the possibility of developing a voting system based on a believability matrix. Though that might not be
possible for practical reasons, it suggests the merit-based decision-making we aspire toward with our current process. The
challenging and probing we encourage are not meant to second-guess every decision but to help us assess the quality of our work
over time.

... 38) Remember that almost everything good comes from having great people
operating in a great culture. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important the

selection, training, testing, evaluation, and sorting out of people is. If you put the goals and the
tasks in the hands of people who can do them well, and if you make crystal clear that they are
personally responsible for achieving the goals and doing the tasks, they should produce excellent
results. This section is about the people part of the feedback loop process, diagramed below.

... 39) First, match the person to the design. Understand what attributes matter most for a

job, and then ascertain whether an individual has them. This matching process requires 1)
visualizing the job and the qualities needed to do it well and then 2) ascertaining if the individual
has those qualities.
Look for believable responsible parties who love producing great results. 55 Remember that values
are most important—e.g., if “work” is what people have to do to make money, I don’t want people to
“work” here. I only want people at Bridgewater who are joining us on an important, shared mission

55
The thing that I like least (or dislike most) about my job is fighting to maintain standards, but it must be done. I know that the only
way for me to succeed and to be happy is to have good people do it for me, which means that I have to hire, train, and sort out
people. It is futile to give responsibilities to people who do not have the qualities required to succeed. It frustrates, and inevitably
angers, all parties, which is subversive to the environment. So, hiring, training, and sorting out people so that responsibilities are
placed in the hands of people who can be trusted to do an excellent job is the only viable path, and is extremely satisfying.

to do great things.
39a) Most importantly, find people who share your values. At Bridgewater, those key values
are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character
(by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).
39b) Look for people who are willing to look at themselves objectively and have character.
These are not natural talents—they are qualities that anyone can acquire. They are also the
qualities that have the biggest influence on whether or not I respect someone. They are
essential for success.
39c) Conceptual thinking and common sense are required in order to assign someone the
responsibility for achieving goals (as distinct from tasks).

... 40) Recognize that the inevitable responsible party is the person who bears the
consequences of what is done. Because of this, the RP must choose wisely when

delegating responsibilities to others, and he must incentivize and manage them appropriately.
There is no escaping that. For example, you are the inevitable RP for taking care of your health
because you’re the one who inevitably bears the consequences. If you’re sick, you might choose to
delegate the responsibility of figuring out what do to about it to a doctor. However, it is your
responsibility to pick the right doctor because you will bear the consequences of that decision.
While it is, of course, also the doctor’s responsibility to handle the responsibilities that you delegate
to him, you still need to make sure that his incentives are aligned with his responsibilities and that
he is doing his job well. The inevitable responsible party can’t delegate all his responsibilities away
and expect good outcomes, even in cases in which he has no expertise. So you can’t escape hiring
and managing properly.

... 41) By and large, you will get what you deserve over time. The results that you end up
with will reflect how you and your people learn to handle things. So take control of your situation
and hold yourself and others accountable for producing great results. People who wish for a great
result but are unwilling to do what it takes to get there will fail.

... 42) The most important responsible parties are those who are most responsible
for the goals, outcomes, and machines (they are those higher in the
pyramid). Give me someone who can effectively be responsible for an area—i.e., who can
design, hire, and sort to achieve the goal, and I can be comfortable about all that is in that area.
Therefore, they are the most important people to choose and manage well.

... 43) Choose those who understand the difference between goals and tasks to
run things. Otherwise you will have to do their jobs for them. The ability to see and value goals
is largely innate, though it improves with experience. It can be tested for, though no tests are
perfect.

... 45) Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills. Values are the deepseated beliefs that motivate behaviors; people will fight for their values, and values determine
people’s compatibility with others. Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are
great learners and fast processors; others possess common sense; still others think creatively or
logically or with supreme organization, etc. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a
foreign language or write computer code.
While values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited
amount of time (e.g., most master’s degrees can be acquired in two years) and often change in
worth (e.g., today’s best programming language can be obsolete in a few years).
It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to fit each role and, more broadly,
with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships,
values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important.

... 46) Understand what each person who works for you is like so that you know
what to expect from them.

How People’s Thinking Abilities Differ
In my many years of running Bridgewater I have learned that people’s thinking abilities differ and that it is
important to understand these differences so that they are appropriately considered when assigning
people to roles. I have tried to find experts who understood these differences to help me better
understand and test for them. I have found a few truly insightful people amid a mass of mediocrity. 56 I
have also found that there are all sorts of theories from all sorts of people about how people think and
why, so very little should be treated as fact. It seems that “political correctness” and the reluctance to
objectively discuss differences in innate abilities have stood in the way of forthright and thoughtful
research on this important subject. While the search for good advice and tests has been challenging, it
has also been invaluable. What follows is a mix of my theories based on my personal observations and a
collection of valuable things I have learned from others. 57 I know I have only scratched the surface of
learning about how people think, why they think differently, and how to test for these different thinking
abilities, so I am excited about the potential of learning more.
I believe, but am not certain about, the following:
•

There are two big differences in how people think that are due to the brain’s coming in two
big halves and different people relying differently on them. 58 This was explained by Caltech
Professor Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize in medicine for attributing these two ways of
thinking to different reliances on the two hemispheres. As a result of this discovery, these two
ways of thinking are called “left-brained” and “right-brained.” Professor Sperry helped us
understand that:
o

The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis.
Left-brained thinkers do these things well. They are also called linear thinkers. When they
excel at this type of thinking they are called “bright.” 59

o

The right hemisphere reasons holistically, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big
picture. Right-brained thinkers do these things well. People who think this way are also
called lateral thinkers. Those who excel at this kind of thinking are called “smart.” 60

Long before I knew that there was a Professor Sperry I saw these differences. I bet you’ve seen
them too.
On a scale of -5 to +5 – left-brained to right-brained – where do you think you fall?
How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?

56

I have particularly valued psychologist Bob Eichinger.
I am convinced that we are just scratching the surface of understanding differences in how people think and how to test for it, so
there is great potential for others to follow this path. Unfortunately, most of the world’s experts I have met are more theoretical than
practical.
58
A good book on this is A Whole New Mind by Daniel H. Pink, and a good article on the science of this is “A Wandering Mind
Heads Straight Toward Insight” by Robert Lee Hotz from The Wall Street Journal.
59
“Bright” people have high IQs, are highly analytical thinkers, and can solve complex mental problems.
60
“Smart” people have common sense, are good at synthesizing, and can imagine what is possible.

Some people see details (trees), and others see big pictures (forests). Those who “see
trees” see the parts most vividly and don’t readily relate the parts to each other in order to see the
big picture—e.g., they might prefer more literal, precise paintings. They are typically left-brained.
Others connect the dots to pictures. In fact, they typically don’t even see the dots; they just see
the pictures. They are typically right-brained. You can detect which type people are by observing
what they focus on. Detailed thinkers can lose sight of the big picture and are more likely to focus
in on a part than to go to the higher level and see the relationship between parts. For example, a
person who focuses on details can be thrown off by word mistakes like “there“ instead of “their,”
while big-picture thinkers won’t even notice the mistake. Similarly, big-picture thinkers can often
understand the meaning of sentences even when key words are reversed—e.g., when “up” is
mistakenly used instead of “down,” they understand that the person speaking couldn’t have
meant “up” in that context. That is because their attention is focused on the context first and the
details second. When describing the same meeting, these two different types will frequently focus
on completely different things and disagree on their interpretations. In discussions, they can
frustrate each other and discount what the other is saying. Similarly, a person of one type
interviewing another type will usually yield an unsatisfactory result.

How confident are you that your self-assessment is right?

•

Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught when making decisions,
and others rely more on their independent reasoning. Let’s call the first group memory-based
learners and the second group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word “learning” I intend
to convey “acquiring knowledge by being taught,” and when using the word “thinking” I mean
“figuring it out for oneself.” Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering
what they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there.
They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the principles
behind what happens. They are typically right-brained. You can tell the difference when what is
learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All Weather). People who rely on
memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of unconventional ideas because their
process is to more readily accept what they have been told and because they are less able to
assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on reasoning won’t care much about
convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who rely on memory-based learning also
tend to align themselves with the consensus more than people who rely on reasoning. Memorybased learners are more willing to accept the status quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less
biased by it. They are more likely to be innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to
be cautious. Performance in school will correlate well with the quality of one’s learning-based
thinking, but will not reliably correlate with one’s reasoning-based thinking. The most able
learners are easily found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The
best thinkers are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass,
especially before they develop track records in the “real world.”

Some people are focused on daily tasks, and others are focused on their goals and how to
achieve them. Those who “visualize” best can see the pictures (rather than the dots) over time.
They have a strong capacity to visualize and will be more likely to make meaningful changes and
anticipate future events. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations,
projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots of change. We call them “creators.”
They are typically right-brained thinkers. By contrast, those who are focused on the daily tasks
are better at managing things that don’t change much or require repetitive processes done
reliably, and are typically best at doing clearly specified tasks. They see things much more
literally and tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They are
slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. They are
typically left-brained thinkers.

•

Some people are “planners,” and others are “perceivers.” Planners like to focus on a plan
and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what’s happening around them and more
readily adapt to it. Perceivers see things happening and work backward to understand the cause
and how to respond; they work from the outside in; they also see many more possibilities that
they compare and choose from; often they see so many that they are confused by them. In
contrast, planners work from the inside out, figuring out first what they want to achieve and then
how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. While a
perceiver likes to see new things and change directions often, this is discomforting to planners,
who prefer to stick to a plan. Planners weigh precedent much more heavily in their decisionmaking, and assume that if it was done before in a certain way, it should be done again in the
same way, while perceivers tend to optimize on the spot. Planners are typically left-brained, and
perceivers are typically right-brained.

Some people are driven more by their emotions, and others are driven more by their
intellect. We all have emotions and intellect. When they conflict, some people will give in to their
emotions, while others maintain control of their emotions and are driven by their intellect. I am
told this is more due to relative reliance on the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, but I’m not
sure. Once again, these two different types typically can’t understand and typically frustrate each
other.

... 48) Use personality assessment tests and quality reflections on experiences to
help you identify these differences. These should be done openly so that these
important differences are embraced and considered in our interactions.

... 49) Understand that different ways of seeing and thinking make people suitable
for different jobs. Since nature created different ways of thinking and since nature never
creates anything without a purpose, 61 each way of thinking has purposes. Often, thinking well for
some purposes necessitates thinking poorly for others. It is highly desirable to understand one’s
own ways, and others’ ways, of thinking, and their best applications. While there is no best quality,
there are certainly some qualities that are more suitable for some jobs (e.g., being a math wiz is
important for a job that requires a math wiz). So don’t treat everyone the same.

Sometimes I see people dealing with each other, especially in groups, without regard for these
differences. This is nonsensical. Both people expressing their own views and those considering
others’ views need to take into account their differences. These differences are real, so it’s dumb to
pretend they don’t exist.
49a) People are best at the jobs that require what they do well.
49b) If you’re not naturally good at one type of thinking, it doesn’t mean you’re precluded
from paths that require that type of thinking, but it does require that you either work with
someone who has that required way of thinking (which works best) or learn to think differently
(which is very difficult and sometimes impossible).

... 50) Don’t hide these differences. Explore them openly with the goal of figuring
out how you and your people are built so you can put the right people in the
right jobs and clearly assign responsibilities. This is good for both your team and for
Bridgewater as a whole.

... 51) Remember that people who see things and think one way often have
difficulty communicating and relating to people who see things and think
another way. Keep in mind how difficult it is to convey what it means to think in an alternative

way for the same reason it would be difficult to convey what the sense of smell is to someone who
doesn’t have the ability to smell.

Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge

52) Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are
Huge
So…
... 53) Think through what values, abilities, and skills you are looking for. A lot of time and

effort is put into hiring a person, and substantial time and resources are invested in new employees’
development before finding out whether they are succeeding. Getting rid of employees who aren’t
succeeding is also difficult, so it pays to be as sure as possible in hiring. Refer to our diagram that shows
how to achieve your goals by comparing them with the outcomes you’re getting, and think of the people
part as shown below. By constantly comparing the picture of what the people are like with the qualities
needed, you will hire better and evolve faster.

... 54) Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire. Avoid
the temptation to think narrowly about filling a job with a specific skill. 62 While having that skill might be
important, what’s most important is determining whether you and they are working toward the same goals
and can work in the same ways and share the same values.

... 55) Write the profile of the person you are looking for into the job description.
... 56) Select the appropriate people and tests for assessing each of these qualities and
compare the results of those assessments to what you’ve decided is needed for
the job. Synthesize the results of those tests to see if there is a “click.”
56a) Remember that people tend to pick people like themselves, so pick interviewers who can
identify what you are looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a visionary, pick a visionary to
do the interview where you test for vision. If there is a mix of qualities you’re looking for, put together
a group of interviewers who embody all of these qualities collectively. Don’t choose interviewers
whose judgment you don’t trust (in other words, choose believable interviewers).
56b) Understand how to use and interpret personality assessments. These can be a fantastic tool in
your arsenal for quickly getting a picture of what people are like—abilities, preferences, and style.

62
The importance of a skill will vary according to the job. The more knowledge-dependent and independent in nature the job is (e.g., a
programmer or lawyer whose job isn’t to think about the direction of the company), the more relevant the required skills are.

They are often much more objective and reliable than interviews.
56c) Pay attention to people’s track records.
56d) Dig deeply to discover why people did what they did. Knowing what they did is valuable only in
helping you figure out what they are like. Understanding the “why” behind people’s actions will tell you
about their qualities and as a result, what you can probably expect from them.
56e) Recognize that performance in school, while of some value in making assessments, doesn’t
tell you much about whether the person has the values and abilities you are looking for.
Memory and processing speed tend to be the abilities that determine success in school (largely
because they’re easier to measure and grade) and are most valued, so school performance is an
excellent gauge of these. School performance is also a good gauge for measuring willingness and
ability to follow directions as well as determination. However, school is of limited value for teaching
and testing common sense, vision, creativity, or decision-making.63 Since those traits all outweigh
memory, processing speed, and the ability to follow directions in most jobs, you must look beyond
school to ascertain whether the applicant has the qualities you’re looking for.
56f) Ask for past reviews. Don’t rely exclusively on the candidate for information about their track
record; instead, talk to people who know them (believable people are best), and look for documented
evidence.
56g) Check references.

... 57) Look for people who have lots of great questions. These are even more important than
great answers.

... 58) Make sure candidates interview you and Bridgewater. Show them the real picture. For

example, share these principles with them to show how we operate and why. Have them listen to the tapes
to see the reality.

... 59) Don’t hire people just to fit the first job they will do at Bridgewater; hire people
you want to share your life with. The best relationships are long term and based on shared

missions and values. Also, turnover is generally inefficient because of the long time it requires for people to
get to know each other and Bridgewater. Both the people you work with and the company itself will evolve
in ways you can’t anticipate. So hire the kind of people you want to be with on this long-term mission.

... 60) Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.” I have too often seen

people hired who don’t sparkle, just because they have clearly demonstrated they were “one of those.” If
you’re looking for a plumber you might be inclined to fill the job with someone who has years of experience,
without confirming whether he has demonstrated the qualities of an outstanding plumber. Yet the difference
between hiring an ordinary versus an extraordinary plumber (or any other expert) is huge. So when
reviewing a candidate’s background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be
outstanding. The most obvious demonstration is outstanding performance within an outstanding peer
group. If you’re less than excited to hire someone for a particular job, don’t do it. The two of you will
probably make each other miserable.

Consider how few important decisions you make as a student from first grade through college. Other than deciding which college to attend in
the senior year of high school and which major to pursue in the sophomore year of college, most people normally just do what they are told to
do.

... 61) Hear the click: Find the right fit between the role and the person. Remember that your

goal is to put the right people in the right design. First understand the responsibilities of the role, then what
qualities are needed to fulfill them excellently, and then ascertain whether an individual has them. This
matching process requires 1) visualizing the job and the qualities needed to do it well and 2) ascertaining if
the individual has those qualities. I describe this process as “hearing the click,” because that’s the sound of
finding the right fit between the role and the individual.

... 62) Pay for the person, not for the job. Look at what they were paid before and what people with
comparable credentials get paid and pay some premium to that, but don’t pay based on the job title.

that the person you hire will not be the great person you need for the job. Continue
the “interviewing” process as intensely after they are on the job as before, and don’t settle.

To Get the People Right
Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and
Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal

64) Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and Operating
a Machine to Achieve the Goal
So…
... 65) Understand the differences between managing, micromanaging, and not
managing. Micromanaging is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do and/or doing

their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement.
Managing means: 1) understanding how well your people and designs are operating to achieve your goals
and 2) constantly improving them. To be successful, you need to manage.
65a) Managing the people who report to you should feel like “skiing together.” Like a ski instructor,
you need to have close contact with your people on the slopes so that you can assess their strengths
and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs. There should be a good back and forth with trial and
error. With time you will be able to decide what they can and can’t effectively handle on their own.
65b) An excellent skier is probably going to be more critical and a better critic of another skier
than a novice skier. A student probably thinks his ski instructor is fabulous, while an Olympic skier
looking at the same ski instructor would assess him to be at a much lower level.

... 66) Constantly compare your outcomes to your goals. Identify problems and diagnose whether
the problems are with the way the organization is designed or with the way the people are handling their
responsibilities. So remember how the following feedback loop to rapid improvement works.

Part 3: My Management Principles

And remember to do this constantly so you have a large sample size. You want to have a large sample size
because 1) any one problem can either be a one-off imperfection or symptomatic of root causes that will
show up as problems repeatedly; and 2) looking at a large sample size of problems will make clear which it
is. Also, the larger your sample size, the clearer the root causes of your problems, and the more obvious
your solutions, will be.
If you do this constantly in this way, your evolutionary process should look like this:

... 67) Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level. Higher-level
thinking doesn’t mean the thinking done by higher-level beings. It means seeing things from a top-down
perspective—like looking at a photo of Earth from outer space, which shows you the relationships between
the continents, counties, and seas, and then going down to a photo of your country, then down to your
neighborhood, then down to your family. If you just saw your family without the perspective of seeing that
there are millions of other families, and there have been many millions of other families over thousands of
years, and observing how your family compares and how families evolve, you would just be dealing with
the items that are coming at you as they transpire without the perspective.

... 68) Connect the case at hand to your principles for handling cases of that type.

Remember that every problem and task is just another “one of those”—i.e., another one of a certain type.
Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a
better job. Whether or not you use the principles written here, you still must decide on a course of action
and what guiding principles will be effective. Through this process you will improve your principles as well
as handle your issues better.

... 69) Conduct the discussion at two levels when a problem occurs: 1) the “machine”
level discussion of why the machine produced that outcome and 2) the “case at
hand” discussion of what to do now about the problem. Don’t make the mistake of just

having the task-level discussion, because then you are micromanaging—i.e., you are doing your
managee’s thinking for him and your managee will mistake your doing this as being OK, when that’s not
OK (because you will be micromanaging). When having the machine-level discussion, think clearly how
things should have gone and explore why they didn’t go that way. If you are in a rush to determine what to
do and you have to tell the person who works for you what to do, point out that you are having to do this,
make clear that you are having to do this and that is what you are doing, and make it a training
experience—i.e., explain what you are doing and why.

... 70) Don’t try to be followed; try to be understood and to understand others. Your goal is

to understand what is true and improve together. If you want to be followed, either for an egotistical reason
or because you believe it more expedient to operate that way, you will pay a heavy price in the long run. If
you are the only one thinking, the results will suffer.
70a) Don’t try to control people by giving them orders. They will likely resent the orders, and when
you aren’t looking, defy them. An authoritarian approach also means you aren’t developing your
employees, and over time they will become increasingly dependent on you, which damages all
parties. Instead, the greatest power you have over intelligent people—and the greatest influence they
will have on you—comes from constantly getting in synch about what is true and what is best so that
they and you want the same things. People must desire to do the right things, and this desire must
come from them. You can, however, show them the connection between fulfilling their responsibilities
and their own well-being. Reaching agreement will come only from radically open discussions in
which you are fair, reasonable, and open-minded.
70b) Communicate the logic and welcome feedback. When making rules or changes, explain the
principles behind the decision. We want reasonable thinkers to operate sensibly. We achieve this
through principles that are sound and well understood, applied and tested through open discussion. It
is each person’s job to 1) evaluate whether he agrees with a decision, and if not, explain why; and 2)
hold each other accountable for operating consistently within the organization’s principles. We want
people who understand the principles that allow our community to succeed and possess strong ethics
that motivate them to work by our rules, rather than to sneak around them. We want people who
know that if the community works well, it will be good for them. We don’t want people who need to be
ordered and threatened. We don’t want people who just follow orders.

... 71) Clearly assign responsibilities. Eliminate any confusion about expectations and ensure that

people view the failure to achieve their goals and do their tasks as personal failures. 64The most important
person is the one who is given the overall responsibility for accomplishing the mission and has both the
vision to see what should be done and the discipline to make sure it’s accomplished by the people who do
the tasks.

... 72) Hold people accountable and appreciate them holding you accountable. It’s better for
them, for you, and for the community. Slacker standards don’t do anyone any good. People can resent
being held accountable, however, and you don’t want to have to tell them what to do all the time. Instead,
reason with them, so that they understand the value and importance of being held accountable. Hold them
accountable on a daily basis. Constant examination of problems builds a sample size that helps point the
way to a resolution and is a good way to detect problems early on before they become critical. Avoiding
these daily conflicts produces huge costs in the end.

72a) Distinguish between failures where someone broke their “contract” from ones where there
was no contract to begin with. If you didn’t make the expectation clear, you generally can’t hold
people accountable for it being fulfilled (with the exception of common sense—which isn’t all that
common). If you find that a responsibility fell through the cracks because there was no contract, think
about whether you need to edit the design of your machine.

64

You learn principles by experiencing the rewards and punishments of your actions interacting with reality. The clearer the relationship is
between cause and effect, the better it is for learning and evolving. So clearly designated responsibilities enhance the feedback and learning
process. For example, if you are in the woods and have to survive on your own, the connection between your actions and their results is
clearer and is all that matters. Blame doesn’t enter into it as it gets you nothing. All that you focus on are the interactions between your actions
and their results.

... 73) Avoid the “sucked down” phenomenon. This occurs when a manager is pulled down to do the

tasks of a subordinate without acknowledging the problem. The sucked down phenomenon bears some
resemblance to job slip, since it involves the manager’s responsibilities slipping into areas that should be
left to others. Both situations represent the reality of a job diverging from the ideal of that job. However, the
sucked down phenomenon is typically the manager’s response to subordinates’ inabilities to do certain
tasks or the manager’s failure to properly redesign how the responsibilities should be handled in light of
changed circumstances. You can tell this problem exists when the manager focuses more on getting tasks
done than on operating his machine.
73a) Watch out for people who confuse goals and tasks, because you can’t trust people with
responsibilities if they don’t understand the goals.
One way to test this: if you ask a high-level question like, “How is goal XYZ going?” a good answer
will provide a synthesis upfront (of how XYZ is in fact going overall), and then support that
assessment with the tasks done to achieve the goal. People who see the tasks and lose sight of the
goals will just explain the tasks that were done and not make the connection to how those tasks relate
to the machine that produces outcomes and achieves goals.

... 74) Think like an owner, and expect the people you work with to do the same. You must
act in the interest of our community and recognize that your well-being is directly connected to the wellbeing of Bridgewater. For example, spend money like it’s your own.

... 75) Force yourself and the people who work for you to do difficult things. It’s usually easy
to make things go well if you’re willing to do difficult things. We must act as trainers in gyms act in order to
keep each other fit. That’s what’s required to produce the excellence that benefits everyone. It is a law of
nature that you must do difficult things to gain strength and power. As with working out, after a while you
make the connection between doing difficult things and the benefits you get from doing them, and you
come to look forward to doing these difficult things.

75a) Hold yourself and others accountable. It is unacceptable for you to say you won’t fight for quality
and truth because it makes you or other people uncomfortable. Character is the ability to get yourself
to do the difficult but right things. Get over the discomfort, and force yourself to hold people
accountable. The choice is between doing that properly or letting our community down by behaving in
a way that isn’t good for you or the people you are “probing” and coaching.

... 76) Don’t worry if your people like you; worry about whether you are helping your
people and Bridgewater to be great. One of the most essential and difficult things you have to do
© 2011 Ray Dalio

82

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Manage as Someone Who Is Designing and
Operating a Machine to Achieve the Goal
is make sure the people who work for you do their jobs excellently. That requires constantly challenging
them and doing things they don’t like you to do, such as probing them. Even your best people, whom you
regularly praise and reward, must be challenged and probed. You shouldn’t be a manager if you have
problems confronting people or if you put being liked above ensuring your people succeed.

... 77) Know what you want and stick to it if you believe it’s right, even if others want to
take you in another direction.
... 78) Communicate the plan clearly. People should know the plans and designs within their

departments. When you decide to divert from an agreed-upon path, be sure to communicate your thoughts
to the relevant parties and get their views so that you are all clear about taking the new path.
78a) Have agreed-upon goals and tasks that everyone knows (from the people in the departments
to the people outside the departments who oversee them). This is important to ensure clarity on
what the goals are, what the plan is, and who is responsible to do what in order to achieve the goals.
It allows people to buy into the plan or to express their lack of confidence and suggest changes. It
also makes clear who is keeping up his end of the bargain and who is falling short. These stated
goals, tasks, and assigned responsibilities should be shown at department meetings at least once a
quarter, perhaps as often as once a month.
78b) Watch out for the unfocused and unproductive “we should … (do something).” Remember
that to really accomplish things we need believable responsible parties who should determine, in an
open-minded way, what should be done; so it is important to identify who these people are by their
names rather than with a vague “we,” and to recognize that it is their responsibility to determine what
should be done. So it is silly for a group of people who are not responsible to say things like “we
should…” to each other. On the other hand, it can be desirable to speak to the responsible party
about what should be done.

... 79) Constantly get in synch with your people. Being out of synch leads to confused and inefficient
decision-making. It can also lead you in conflicting directions either because 1) you are not clear with each
other, which often generates wildly differing assumptions, or 2) you have unresolved differences in your
views of how things should proceed and why. Getting in synch by discussing who will do what and why is
essential for mutual progress. It doesn’t necessarily entail reaching a consensus. Often there will be
irreconcilable differences about what should be done, but a decision still needs to be made, which is fine.
The process of getting in synch will make it clear what is to be done and why, even if it cannot eliminate
difference. One of the most difficult and most important things you must do, and have others do, is bring
forth disagreement and work through it together to achieve a resolution. Recognize that this process takes
time. It can happen any way people prefer: discussion, e-mail, etc. You must have a workable process for
making decisions even when disagreements remain. I discuss such a process in the earlier section on
getting in synch.

... 80) Get a “threshold level of understanding”—i.e., a rich enough understanding of the people,
processes and problems around you to make well-informed decisions.

... 81) Avoid staying too distant. You need to know your people extremely well, provide and receive
regular feedback, and have quality discussions. Your job design needs to build in the time to do these
things.

81a) Tool: Use daily updates as a tool for staying on top of what your people are doing and
thinking. Daily updates are brief descriptions of what the person did that day, what they are planning
to do the next day, their problems, their questions, and their observations. They typically take about
five minutes to write and do wonders for staying in touch.

... 82) Learn confidence in your people—don’t presume it. It takes time to learn about people and
what confidences can be placed in them. Sometimes new people are offended we don’t yet have
confidence in how they are handling their responsibilities. They think it’s a criticism of their abilities when in
fact it’s a realistic recognition that we simply haven’t had enough time or direct experience with them to
form a point of view. No manager (including myself) should delegate responsibilities to people we don’t yet
know well enough to have confidence in. And new people shouldn’t be offended if we haven’t yet formed
that confidence.

... 83) Vary your involvement based on your confidence. Management largely consists of

scanning and probing everything for which you are responsible to identify suspicious signs. Based on what
you see, you should vary your degree of digging, doing more of it for people and areas that look more
suspicious, and less of it where probing instills you with confidence. With the right tools in place and
performing well, your scanning will include both reviewing the output of these tools (e.g., “issues log,”
“metrics,” “daily updates,” and “checklists”) and spot-checking.

... 84) Avoid the “theoretical should.” The theoretical should occurs when a manager theorizes that

people should be able to do something when they can’t or without actually knowing whether they can do it.

... 85) Care about the people who work for you. If you are not working with people you care about

and respect, this whole thing ain’t worth it. If you don’t believe that, you probably shouldn’t work at
Bridgewater. While it’s desirable to convey these feelings, having them is more important. It is good to
share your lives together, but not required. Be there for weddings, births, and funerals. This is something
that I try to do but fail to do enough because of the numbers, so I convey that I will be there for anyone who
really needs me. Personal contact at the time of personal difficulty is a must.

... 86) Logic, reason, and common sense must trump everything else in decisionmaking.
... 87) While logic drives our decisions, feelings are very relevant. A feeling is a reality—and a

good reality—and it’s up to management to deal with all realities sensibly. Good emotions are important. In
fact, they are probably most important since they are the reasons behind the good things we do, e.g.,
satisfaction with a job wonderfully done and love of others. Emotions are bad only if they cloud judgment
and take us away from what we want.

... 88) Escalate when you can’t adequately handle your responsibilities, and make sure
that the people who work for you do the same. Escalating means saying that you don’t

believe that you can successfully handle a situation and that you are passing the “responsible party” (RP)
job to someone else. The person you are escalating to—the person to whom you report—can then decide
whether to coach you through it, take control, have someone else handle it, or do something else.
However, the boss should avoid being drawn into doing the job of the person who is failing without
exploring why the job has not been done successfully without help. It’s very important to get an accurate
assessment of what each person can and can’t do and why. If the boss just does the job for the person,
even if it produces good results, we will lack the right attribution of success and failure. Remember that an
important goal is to learn about what a person is like from testing, and that we want to get that information
without crashing the car. So, the RP must either say that he can handle his job or that he cannot. And it is
the responsibility of the boss to make the assessment of whether to remove the RP from the driver’s seat
because he might crash. We learn from mistakes by seeing our failures, feeling the pain of them, and
reflecting and gaining insight. If the boss and the RP don’t recognize the RP’s failures to fix things, and the
RP lacks the ability to do the job, trouble will result. Remember that life is the best teacher—“the proof is in
the pudding.” So going through this process is essential to real learning.

88a) Make sure your people know to be proactive. Demand that they speak up when they won’t meet
agreed-upon deliverables or deadlines. This communication is essential to getting in synch on both a
project level and on a personal level.
88b) Tool: An escalation button. Because there is confusion at times about whether responsible parties
are conveying to their managers their problems or whether they are escalating, use an escalation
button. This is a tool that makes clear to the manager that the managee is escalating.

... 89) Involve the person who is the point of the pyramid when encountering material
cross-departmental or cross sub-departmental issues. Imagine an organizational chart as a
pyramid that consists of numerous pyramids, so:

When issues involve parties that are not in the same part of the pyramid, it is generally desirable to involve
the person who is at the point of the pyramid. The individual at the point has the perspective and
knowledge to weigh the trade-offs properly and make an informed decision. Not involving the person at the
point of the pyramid will likely cause problems. In the diagram above, if persons G and H are having an
issue, who is the point of the pyramid? If persons F and I are having an issue, who is the point of the
pyramid? 65

To Get the People Right
Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from Your “Machine”

90) Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from
Your “Machine”
So…
... 91) Know what your people are like, and make sure they do their jobs excellently. This

requires constantly challenging them and probing them. That’s true even if your people are doing their jobs
well, even though those people can be given more leeway.

... 92) Constantly probe the people who report to you, and encourage them to probe
you. Managers are much less able to discover the right things to do than most people assume. I know

that’s true for me. The people who work for you should constantly challenge you, in order for you to
become as good as you can be. Also, inviting criticism brings to the surface any subterranean discontent
and makes the people working for you responsible for helping to find solutions. It’s much easier for people
to remain spectators offering unchallenged comments from the stands than to become players on the field.
Forcing people onto the field strengthens the whole team. Communication is a two-way responsibility.
92a) Remind the people you are probing that problems and mistakes are fuel for improvement.
They ought to understand that probing is good for them and everyone else. The main reason
Bridgewater has improved at a much faster rate than most other companies over the past 30 years is
that we seek out problems and find systematic ways of eliminating them. This approach has given us
an unlimited supply of practical ways to improve.

... 93) Probe to the level below the people who work for you. You can’t understand how the

person who reports to you manages others unless you know their direct reports and can observe how they
behave with them. Also encourage the people who work two levels below you to bring their disagreements
with their bosses to you.

... 94) Remember that few people see themselves objectively, so it’s important to
welcome probing and to probe others.
... 95) Probe so that you have a good enough understanding of whether problems are
likely to occur before they actually do. If problems take you by surprise, it is probably because

you are either too far removed from your people and processes or you haven’t adequately thought through
how the people and processes might lead to various outcomes.
95a) When a crisis appears to be brewing, contact should be so close that it’s extremely unlikely
that there will be any surprises.
95b) Investigate and let people know you are going to investigate so there are no surprises and
they don’t take it personally.

... 96) Don’t “pick your battles.” Fight them all. If you see something wrong, even something small,

deal with it. Because 1) small badnesses can be symptomatic of serious underlying problems; 2) resolving
small differences of perception may prevent more serious divergences of views; and 3) in trying to help to
train people, constant reinforcement of desired behavior is helpful. The more battles you fight, the more
opportunities you will have to get to know each other and the faster the evolutionary process will occur.

... 97) Don’t let people off the hook. Ask the important, difficult questions, and independently audit.

... 98) Don’t assume that people’s answers are correct. They could be erroneous theories or

“spin,” so you need to occasionally double check them, especially when they sound questionable. Some
managers are reluctant to do this, feeling as though it is the equivalent of saying they don’t trust them.
These managers need to understand and convey that trust in the accuracy of people’s statements is
gained or lost through this process. People will learn to be much more accurate in what they say to you if
they understand this—and increasingly, you will learn who and what you can rely on.

... 99) Make the probing transparent rather than private. That will help to assure the quality of the

probing (because others can make their own assessments), and it will reinforce the culture of transparency
and freedom to find truth.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”

100) Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”
So…
... 101) Make accurate assessments. Since truth is the foundation of excellence and people are your

most important resource, make the most precise personnel evaluations possible. This accuracy takes time
and considerable back-and-forth. Your assessment of how responsible parties are performing should be
based not on whether they’re doing it your way but on whether they’re doing it in a good way. Speak
frankly, listen with an open mind, consider the views of other believable and honest people, and try to get in
synch about what’s going on with the person and why. Remember not to be overconfident in your
assessments as it’s possible you are wrong.
101a) Use evaluation tools such as performance surveys, metrics, and formal reviews to
document all aspects of a person’s performance. These will help clarify assessments and
communication surrounding them.
101b) Maintain “baseball cards” and/or “believability matrixes” for your people. Imagine if you had
baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages, home runs,
errors, ERAs, win/loss records. You could see what they did well and poorly and call on the right
people to play the right positions in a very transparent way. These would also simplify discussions
about compensation, incentives, moving players up to first string, or cutting them from the team. You
can and should keep such records of your people. Create your baseball cards to achieve your goals
of conveying what the person is like. I use ratings, forced rankings, metrics, results, and credentials.
Baseball cards can be passed to potential new managers as they consider candidates for
assignments.

... 102) Evaluate employees with the same rigor as you evaluate job candidates. Ask

yourself: “Would I hire this person knowing what I now know about them?” I find it odd and silly that
interviewers often freely and confidently criticize job candidates despite not knowing them well, yet they
won’t criticize employees for similar weaknesses even though they have more evidence. That is because
some people view criticism as harmful and feel less protective of an outsider than they do of a fellow
employee. If you believe accuracy is best for everyone, then you should see why this is a mistake and why
frank evaluations must be ongoing.

... 103) Know what makes your people tick, because people are your most important
resource. Develop a full profile of each person’s values, abilities, and skills. These qualities are the real

drivers of behavior, and knowing them in detail will tell you which jobs a person can and cannot do well,
which ones they should avoid, and how the person should be trained. I have often seen people struggling
in a job and their manager trying for months to find the right response because the manager overlooked the
person’s “package.”These profiles should change as the people change.

... 104) Recognize that while most people prefer compliments over criticisms, there is
nothing more valuable than accurate criticisms. While it is important to be clear about what
people are doing well, there should not be a reluctance to profile people in a way that describes their
weaknesses. It is vital that you be accurate.

... 105) Make this discovery process open, evolutionary, and iterative. Articulate your theory of
a person’s values, abilities, and skills upfront and share this with him; listen to his and others’ response to
your description; organize a plan for training and testing; and reassess your theory based on the
performance you observe. Do this on an ongoing basis. After several months of discussions and real-world
tests, you and he should have a pretty good idea of what he is like. Over time this exercise will crystallize
suitable roles and appropriate training, or it will reveal that it’s time for the person to leave Bridgewater.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”

... 106) Provide constant, clear, and honest feedback, and encourage discussion of this
feedback. Don’t hesitate to be both critical and complimentary—and be sure to be open-minded.
Training and assessing will be better if you frequently explain your observations. Providing this feedback
constantly is the most effective way to train. 66

106a) Put your compliments and criticisms into perspective. I find that many people tend to blow
evaluations out of proportion, so it helps to clarify that the weakness or mistake under discussion is
not indicative of your total evaluation. Example: One day I told one of the new research people what a
good job I thought he was doing and how strong his thinking was. It was a very positive initial
evaluation. A few days later I heard him chatting away for hours about stuff that wasn’t related to
work, so I spoke to him about the cost to his and our development if he regularly wasted time.
Afterward I learned he took away from that encounter the idea that I thought he was doing a horrible
job and that he was on the brink of being fired. But my comment about his need for focus had nothing
to do with my overall evaluation of him. If I had explained myself when we sat down that second time,
he could have better put my comments in perspective.
106b) Remember that convincing people of their strengths is generally much easier than
convincing them of their weaknesses. People don’t like to face their weaknesses. At Bridgewater,
because we always seek excellence, more time is spent discussing weaknesses. Similarly, problems
require more time than things that are going well. Problems must be figured out and worked on, while
things that are running smoothly require less attention. So we spend a lot of time focusing on people’s
weaknesses and problems. This is great because we focus on improving, not celebrating how great
we are, which is in fact how we get to be great. For people who don’t understand this fact, the
environment can be difficult. It’s therefore important to 1) clarify and draw attention to people’s
strengths and what’s being done well; and2) constantly remind them of the healthy motive behind this
process of exploring weaknesses. Aim for complete accuracy in your assessments. Don’t feel you
have to find an equal number of “good and bad” qualities in a person. Just describe the person or the
circumstances as accurately as possible, celebrating what is good and noting what is bad.
106c) Encourage objective reflection—lots and lots of it.
106d) Employee reviews: While feedback should be constant, reviews are periodic. The purpose of a
review is to review the employee's performance and to state what the person is like as it pertains to
their doing their job.
A job review should have little surprises in it—this is because throughout the year, if you can’t make
sense of how the person is doing their job or if you think it’s being done badly, you should probe them
to seek understanding of root causes of their performance. Because it is very difficult for people to
identify their own weaknesses, they need the appropriate probing (not nitpicking) of specific cases by
others to get at the truth of what they are like and how they are fitting into their jobs.
From examining these specific cases and getting in synch about them, agreed-upon patterns will
emerge. As successes and failures will occur in everyone (every batter strikes out a lot), in reviewing
someone the goal is see the patterns and to understand the whole picture rather than to assume that
one or a few failures or successes is representative of the person. You have to understand the
person’s modus operandi and that to be successful, they can’t be successful in all ways—e.g., to be
meticulous they might not be able to be fast (and vice versa). Steve Jobs has been criticized as being
autocratic and impersonal, but his modus operandi might require him being that way, so the real

be made in the review, not just a theoretical assessment that he should do what he is doing and be
less autocratic.
In some cases it won’t take long to see what a person is like—e.g., it doesn’t take long to hear if a
person can sing. In other cases it takes a significant number of samples and time to reflect on them.
Over time and with a large sample size you should be able to see what people are like, and their track
records (i.e., the level and the steepness up or down in the trajectories that they are responsible for,
rather than the wiggles in these) paint a very clear picture of what you can expect from them.
If there are performance problems, it is either because of design problems (e.g., the person has too
many responsibilities) or fit/abilities problems. If the problems are due to the person’s inabilities, these
inabilities are either because of the person’s innate weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., with a height
of 5-foot-2, the person probably shouldn’t be a center on the basketball team) or because of
inadequate training to do the job. A good review, and getting in synch throughout the year, should get
at these things.
The goal of a review is to be clear about what the person can and can’t be trusted to do based on
what the person is like. From there, “what to do about it” (i.e., how these qualities fit into the job
requirement) can be determined.

... 107) Understand that you and the people you manage will go through a process of
personal evolution. Personal evolution occurs first by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, and
then by changing your weaknesses (e.g., through training) or changing jobs to play to strengths and
preferences. This process, while generally difficult for both managers and their subordinates, has made
people happier and Bridgewater more successful. Remember that most people are happiest when they are
improving and doing things that help them advance most rapidly, so learning your people’s weaknesses is
just as valuable for them and for you as learning their strengths.

... 108) Recognize that your evolution at Bridgewater should be relatively rapid and a
natural consequence of discovering your strengths and weaknesses; as a result,
your career path is not planned at the outset. Your career path isn’t planned because the

evolutionary process is about discovering your likes and dislikes as well as your strengths and
weaknesses. The best career path for anyone is based on this information. In other words, each person’s
career direction will evolve differently based on what we all learn. This process occurs by putting people
into jobs that they are likely to succeed at, but that they have to stretch themselves to do well. They should
be given enough freedom to learn and think for themselves while being coached so they can be taught and
prevented from making unacceptable mistakes. During this process they should receive constant feedback.
They should reflect on whether their problems can be resolved by additional learning or stem from innate
qualities that can’t be changed. Typically it takes six to 12 months to get to know a person in a by-and-large
sort of way and about 18 months to change behavior (depending on the job and the person). During this
time there should be periodic mini-reviews and several major ones. Following each of these assessments,
new assignments should be made to continue to train and test them. They should be tailored to what was
learned about the person’s likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses. This is an iterative process in
which these cumulative experiences of training, testing, and adjusting direct the person to ever more
suitable roles and responsibilities. It benefits the individual by providing better self-understanding and
greater familiarity with various jobs at Bridgewater. This is typically both a challenging and rewarding
process. When it results in a parting of ways, it’s usually because people find they cannot be excellent and
happy in any job at Bridgewater or they refuse to go through this process.

... 109) Remember that the only purpose of looking at what people did is to learn what
they are like. Knowing what they are like will tell you how you can expect them to handle their
responsibilities in the future. Intent matters, and the same actions can stem from different causes.

Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”
109a) Look at patterns of behaviors and don’t read too much into any one event. Since there is no
such thing as perfection, even excellent managers, companies, and decisions will have problems. It’s
easy, though often not worth much, to identify and dwell on tiny mistakes. In fact, this can be a
problem if you get bogged down pinpointing and analyzing an infinite number of imperfections. At the
same time, minor mistakes can sometimes be manifestations of serious root causes that could cause
major mistakes down the road, so they can be quite valuable to diagnose. When assessing mistakes
it is important to 1) ask whether these mistakes are manifestations of something serious or
unimportant and 2) reflect on the frequency of them. An excellent decision-maker and a bad decisionmaker will both make mistakes. The difference is what causes them to make mistakes and the
frequency of their mistakes.
There is also a difference between “I believe you made a bad decision” and “I believe you are a bad
decision-maker,” which can be ascertained only by seeing the pattern. Any one event has many
different possible explanations, whereas a pattern of behavior can tell you a lot about root causes.
There are many qualities that make up a person. To understand each requires 1) a reliable sample
size and 2) getting in synch (i.e., asking the person why and giving feedback). Some qualities don’t
require a large sample size—e.g., it takes only one data point to know if a person can sing—and
others take multiple observations (five to 10). The number of observations needed to detect a pattern
largely depends on how well you get in synch after each observation. A quality discussion of how and
why a person behaved a certain way should help you quickly understand the larger picture.
109b) Don’t believe that being good or bad at some things means that the person is good or bad
at everything. Realize that all people have strengths and weaknesses.

... 110) If someone is doing their job poorly, consider whether this is due to inadequate
learning (i.e., training/experience) or inadequate ability. A weakness due to a lack of

experience or training or due to inadequate time can be fixed. A lack of inherent ability cannot. Failing to
distinguish between these causes is a common mistake among managers, because managers are often
reluctant to appear unkind or judgmental by saying someone lacks ability. They also know people assessed
this way tend to push back hard against accepting a permanent weakness. Managers need to get beyond
this reluctance. In our diagram of thinking through the machine that will produce outcomes, think about…

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”

... 111) Remember that when it comes to assessing people, the two biggest mistakes are
being overconfident in your assessment and failing to get in synch on that
assessment. Don’t make those mistakes.
111a) Get in synch in a non-hierarchical way regarding assessments. The greatest single
discrepancy between a manager and a managee is how well each performs his job. In most
organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The
managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than the employee’s selfassessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees
also have opinions of managers that in most companies they wouldn’t dare bring up, so
misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of
the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in synch in a
high-quality way.
111b) Learn about your people and have them learn about you with very frank conversations
about mistakes and their root causes. You need to be clear in conveying your assessments and be
open-minded in listening to people’s replies. This is so they can understand your thinking and you can
open-mindedly consider their perspectives. So together you can work on setting their training and
career paths. Recognizing and communicating people’s weakness is one of the most difficult things
managers have to do. Good managers recognize that while it is difficult in the short term, it actually
makes things easier in the long term, because the costs of having people in jobs where they can’t
excel are huge. Most managers at other companies dodge being as open with assessments as we
insist on; more typically, managers elsewhere tend to be less frank in conveying their views, which is
neither fair nor effective.

... 112) Help people through the pain that comes with exploring their weaknesses.

Emotions tend to heat up during most disagreements, especially about someone’s possible weaknesses.
Speak in a calm, slow, and analytical manner to facilitate communication. If you are calm and open to
others’ views, they are less likely to shut down logical exchanges than if you behave emotionally. Put things
in perspective by reminding them that their pain is the pain that comes with learning and personal
evolution—they’re going to be in a much better place by getting to truth. Consider asking them to go away
and reflect when they are calm, and have a follow-up conversation in a few days.

... 113) Recognize that when you are really in synch with people about weaknesses,
whether yours or theirs, they are probably true. Getting to this point is a great achievement.

When you reach an agreement, it’s a good sign you’re there. This is one of the main reasons why the
person being evaluated needs to be an equal participant in the process of finding truth. So when you do
agree, write it down on the relevant baseball card. This information will be a critical building block for future
success.

... 114) Remember that you don’t need to get to the point of “beyond a shadow of a
doubt” when judging people. Instead, work toward developing a mutually agreed “by-and-large”

understanding of someone that has a high level of confidence behind it. When necessary, take the time to
enrich this understanding. That said, you should not aim for perfect understanding. Perfect understanding
isn’t possible, and trying to get it will waste time and stall progress.

... 115) Understand that you should be able to learn the most about what a person is like
and whether they are a “click” for the job in their first year. You should be able to roughly

assess someone’s abilities after six to 12 months of close contact and numerous tests and getting in synch
about them. A more confident assessment so that you can make a more confident role assignment will
probably take about 18 months. This timeline will of course depend on the job, the person, the amount of
contact with that person, and how well you do it. As I explain in the section on design, the ratio of senior
managers to junior managers as well as the ratio of managers to the number of people who work two levels

92

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”
below them should be small enough to ensure quality communication and mutual understanding.
Generally, that ratio should not be more than 1:10, preferably more like 1:5.

... 116) Continue assessing people throughout their time at Bridgewater. You will get to know
them better, it will help you train and direct them, and you won’t be stuck with an obsolete picture. Most
importantly, assess what your people’s core values and abilities are and make sure they complement
Bridgewater’s. Since core values and abilities are more permanent than skills, they are more important to
ascertain, especially at Bridgewater. As mentioned, you should be able to roughly assess people’s abilities
after six to 12 months of close contact and confidently assess them after 18 months.
Don’t rest with that evaluation, however. Always ask yourself if you would have hired them for that job
knowing what you now know. If not, get them out of the job.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Train and Test People Through Experiences

117) Train and Test People Through Experiences
So…
... 118) Understand that training is really guiding the process of personal evolution. It

requires the trainee to be open-minded, to suspend ego in order to find out what he is doing well and
poorly, and to decide what to do about it. It also requires the trainer to be open-minded (and to do the other
things previously mentioned). It would be best if at least two believable trainers work with each trainee in
order to triangulate views about what the trainee is like. As previously explained, the training should be
through shared experiences like that of a ski instructor skiing with his student—i.e., it should be an
apprentice relationship.

... 119) Know that experience creates internalization. A huge difference exists between memory-

based “book” learning and hands-on, internalized learning. A medical student who has “learned” to perform
an operation in his medical school class has not learned it in the same way as a doctor who has already
conducted several operations. In the first case, the learning is stored in the conscious mind, and the
medical student draws on his memory bank to remember what he has learned. In the second case, what
the doctor has learned through hands-on experience is stored in the subconscious mind and pops up
without his consciously recalling it from the memory bank. People who excel at book learning tend to call
up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions. Others who are better at
internalized learning use the thoughts that flow from their subconscious. The experienced skier doesn’t
recite instructions on how to ski and then execute them; rather, he does it well “without thinking,” in the
same way he breathes without thinking. Understanding these differences is essential. 67Remember that
experience creates internalization. Doing things repeatedly leads to internalization, which produces a
quality of understanding that is generally vastly superior to intellectualized learning.

... 120) Provide constant feedback to put the learning in perspective. Most training comes from
doing and getting in synch about performance. Feedback should include reviews of what is succeeding and
what is not in proportion to the actual situation rather than in an attempt to balance compliments and
criticisms. You are a manager, and you want your machine to function as intended. For it do so, employees
must meet expectations, and only you can help them to understand where they are in relation to
expectations. As strengths and weaknesses become clearer, responsibilities can be more appropriately
tailored to make the machine work better and to facilitate personal evolution. The more intensely this is
done, the more rapid the evolutionary process will be. So you must constantly get in synch about employee
performance.

... 121) Remember that everything is a case study. Think about what it is a case of and what
principles apply.

... 122) Teach your people to fish rather than give them fish. It is a bad sign when you tell people

what they should do because that behavior typically reflects micromanagement or inability on the part of
the person being managed. Instead, you should be training and testing. So give people your thoughts on
how they might approach their decisions or how and why you would operate in their shoes, but don’t dictate
to them. Almost all that you will be doing is constantly getting in synch about how they are doing things and
exploring why.

67
I believe that school overrates the importance of intellectualized learning. People who were terrific in school and very good at this type of
learning tend to overvalue it, or at least fail to distinguish it from the experiential/internalized kind of learning. This lack of differentiation can
become a great peril later in life. Many people who have had great academic success need to be mindful of this challenge, especially if their
success has been in the “sciences,” such as math and engineering. I also believe this is why hands-on experience is particularly valuable for
these types of people.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Get the People Right
Train and Test People Through Experiences

... 123) Recognize that sometimes it is better to let people make mistakes so that they
can learn from them rather than tell them the better decision. However, since the
connections between cause and effect can be misunderstood, providing feedback for these people is
essential to the learning process.

123a) When criticizing, try to make helpful suggestions. Your goal is to help your people understand
and improve, so your suggestions are important. Offering suggestions also helps those being
criticized to understand that your goal is to help them and Bridgewater, not to hurt them.
123b) Learn from success as well as from failure. Point out examples of jobs that are well done and
the causes of success. This reinforces good behavior and creates role models for those who are
learning.

... 124) Know what types of mistakes are acceptable and unacceptable, and don’t allow
the people who work for you to make the unacceptable ones. When considering what

failures you are willing to allow in order to promote learning through trial-and-error, weigh the potential
damage of a mistake against the benefit of incremental learning. In defining what latitude I’m willing to give
people, I say, “I’m willing to let you scratch or dent the car, but I won’t put you in a position where I think
there’s a significant risk you could total it.”

... 125) Recognize that behavior modification typically takes about 18 months of
constant reinforcement. The first step is intellectualizing the best way of doing things. If you’re out of
shape you must understand that you are out of shape, you must want to get in shape, and you must
understand the way to get in shape: “I want to be fit by eating well and exercising.” Then the intellect will
fight with desires and emotions. With determination, the intellect will overcome the impediments to doing
what’s necessary to achieve the goal, and the desired behavior will occur. After doing that consistently for
18 months, the new behavior will be internalized.

... 126) Train people; don’t rehabilitate them. Training is part of the plan to develop people’s skills and
to help them evolve. Rehabilitation is the process of trying to create significant change in people’s values
and/or abilities. Since values and abilities are difficult to change, rehabilitation typically takes too long and
is too improbable to do at Bridgewater. If attempted, it is generally best directed by professionals over
extended periods of time. People with inappropriate values and inadequate abilities to meet their job
requirements have devastating impacts on the organization. They should be properly sorted (see the
principles section on sorting).

126a) A common mistake: training and testing a poor performer to see if he or she can acquire the
required skills without simultaneously trying to assess their abilities. Skills are readily testable,
so they should be easy to determine. Knowing them is less important than knowing people’s abilities.
That makes picking people with the right skills relatively easy. Abilities, especially right-brained
abilities, are more difficult to assess. When thinking about why someone is a poor performer, openly
consider whether it is a problem with their abilities. Values are the toughest and take the longest to
assess.

... 127) After you decide “what’s true” (i.e., after you figure out what your people are
like), think carefully about “what to do about it.”As mentioned before, it’s important to

separate thinking about “what’s true” and thinking about “what to do about it.” Figuring out what’s true takes
time—often several months filled with a large sample size. Figuring out what to do about it (i.e., designing)
is much faster—typically hours or days—but it isn’t instantaneous. Too often people either jump to
decisions or don’t make them.

To Get the People Right
Sort People into Other Jobs at Bridgewater, or
Remove Them from Bridgewater

128) Sort People into Other Jobs at Bridgewater, or
Remove Them from Bridgewater
So…
... 129) When you find that someone is not a good “click” for a job, get them out of it
ASAP. If you are expecting/wishing people to be much better in the near future than they have been in

the past, you are making a serious mistake—instead, sort the people. People who repeatedly operated in a
certain way probably will continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they’re like.
Since people generally change slowly (at best), you should expect slow improvement (at best), so instead
of hoping for improvement, you need to sort the people or change the design to supplement them. Since
changing the design to accommodate people’s weaknesses is generally a bad idea, it is generally better to
sort the people.
Sometimes good people “lose their boxes” because they can’t evolve into responsible parties soon enough.
Either there is a problem with their qualities or it will take too long to train them well. Some of these people
might be good at another position within Bridgewater. Remember that identifying failure and learning from it
are part of the evolutionary process. Make sure you record the reasons on the relevant “baseball card” and
think about what a good next step would be for that individual.

... 130) Know that it is much worse to keep someone in a job who is not suited for it than
it is to fire someone. Don’t collect people. Firing people is not a big deal—certainly nowhere near as
big a deal as keeping badly performing people, because keeping a person in a job they are not suited for is
terrible both for the person (because it prevents personal evolution) and our community (because we all
bear the consequences and it erodes meritocracy). Consider the enormous costs of not firing someone
unsuited for a job: the costs of bad performance over a long time; the negative effect on the environment;
the time and effort wasted trying to train the person; and the greater pain of separation involved with
someone who’s been here awhile (say, five years or more) compared with someone let go after just a year.

... 131) When people are “without a box,” consider whether there is an open box at
Bridgewater that would be a better fit. If not, fire them. Remember that we hire people not

to fill their first job at Bridgewater nor primarily for their skills. We are trying to select people with whom we’d
like to share our lives. We expect everyone to evolve here. Because managers have a better idea of
people’s strengths and weaknesses and their fit within our culture than what emerges from the interview
process, you have invaluable information for assessing them for another role at Bridgewater.

... 132) Do not lower the bar. If a person can’t operate consistently with our requirements of excellence
and radical truth and can’t get to the bar in an acceptable time frame, they have to leave. We want to
neither lower the bar nor enter into a long-term rehabilitation program.

To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve
Problems…
133) Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively
So…
... 134) Keep in mind the 5-Step Process explained in Part 2.
... 135) Recognize that perceiving problems is the first essential step toward great
management. As in nature, if you can’t see what’s happening around you, you will deteriorate and

eventually die off. People who can 1) perceive problems; 2) decide what to do about them; and 3) get these
things done can be great managers.

... 136) Understand that problems are the fuel for improvement. Problems are like wood thrown
into a locomotive engine, because burning them up—i.e., inventing and implementing solutions—propels
us forward. Problems are typically manifestations of root causes, so they provide clues for getting better.
Most of the movement toward excellence comes from eliminating problems by getting at their root causes
and making the changes that pay off repeatedly in the future. So finding problems should get you excited
because you have found an opportunity to get better.

... 137) You need to be able to perceive if things are above the bar (i.e., good enough) or
below the bar (i.e., not good enough), and you need to make sure your people can
as well. That requires the ability to synthesize.
... 138) Don’t tolerate badness. Too often I observe people who observe badness and tolerate it.

Sometimes it is because they don’t have the courage to make the needed changes, and sometimes it is
because they don’t know how to fix it. Both are very bad. If they’re stuck, they need to seek the advice of
believable people to make the needed changes, and if that doesn’t work, they need to escalate.

... 139) “Taste the soup.” A good restaurateur constantly tastes the food that is coming out of his kitchen
and judges it against his vision of what is excellent. A good manager needs to do the same.

... 140) Have as many eyes looking for problems as possible. Encourage people to bring

problems to you and look into them carefully. If everyone in your area feels responsible for the well-being of
that area and feels comfortable speaking up about problems, your risks of overlooking them will be much
less than if you are the only one doing this. This will help you perceive problems, gain the best ideas, and
keep you and your people in synch.
140a) “Pop the cork.” It’s your responsibility to make sure that communications from your people are
flowing freely.
140b) Hold people accountable for raising their complaints. Ask yourself: 1) does someone think
there’s something wrong; 2) did this lead to a proper discussion; and 3) if they felt raising the issue
didn’t lead to the proper response, did they escalate it? That’s how it should be.
140c) The leader must encourage disagreement and be either impartial or open-minded.

Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively
140d) The people closest to certain jobs probably know them best, or at least have perspectives
you need to understand, so those people are essential for creating improvement.

... 141) To perceive problems, compare how the movie is unfolding relative to your
script—i.e., compare the actual operating of the machine and the outcomes it is producing to your

visualization of how it should operate and the outcomes you expected. As long as you have the
visualization of your expectations in mind to compare with the actual results, you will note the deviations so
you can deal with them. For example, if you expect improvement to be within a specific range…

… and it ends up looking like this…

… you will know you need to get at the root cause to deal with it. If you don’t, the trajectory will probably
continue.

Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively

... 142) Don’t use the anonymous “we” and “they,” because that masks personal
responsibility—use specific names. For example, don’t say “we” or “they” handled it badly. Also
avoid: “We should...” or “We are...”Who is “we”? Exactly who should, who made a mistake, or who did a
great job? Use specific names. Don’t undermine personal accountability with vagueness. When naming
names, it’s also good to remind people of related principles like “mistakes are good if they result in
learning.”

... 143) Be very specific about problems; don’t start with generalizations. For example, don’t
say, “Client advisors aren’t communicating well with the analysts.”Be specific: name which client advisors
aren’t doing this well and in which ways. Start with the specifics and then observe patterns.

... 144) Tool: Use the following tools to catch problems: issues logs, metrics, surveys,
checklists, outside consultants, and internal auditors.
1) Issues log: A problem or “issue” that should be logged is easy to identify: anything that went wrong.
The issues log acts like a water filter that catches garbage. By examining the garbage and
determining where it came from, you can determine how to eliminate it at the source. You diagnose
root causes for the issues log the same way as for a drilldown (explained below) in that the log must
include a frank assessment of individual contributions to the problems alongside their strengths and
weaknesses. As you come up with the changes that will reduce or eliminate the garbage, the water
will become cleaner. In addition to using issues logs to catch problems, you can use them to measure
the numbers and types of problems, and they can therefore be effective metrics of performance. A
common challenge to getting people to use issues logs is that they are sometimes viewed as vehicles
for blaming people. You have to encourage use by making clear how necessary they are, rewarding
active usage, and punishing non-use. If, for example, something goes wrong and it’s not in the issues
log, the relevant people should be in big trouble. But if something goes wrong and it’s there (and,
ideally, properly diagnosed), the relevant people will probably be rewarded or praised. But there must
be personal accountability.
2) Metrics: Detailed metrics measure individual, group, and system performance. Make sure these
metrics aren’t being “gamed” so that they cease to convey a real picture. If your metrics are good
enough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what your people are doing and how well
they are doing it that you can nearly manage via the metrics. However, don’t even think of taking the
use of metrics that far! Instead, use the metrics to ask questions and explore. Remember that any
single metric can mislead. You need enough evidence to establish patterns. Metrics and 360 reviews
reveal patterns that make it easier to achieve agreement on employees’ strengths and weaknesses.
Of course, the people providing the information for metrics must deliver accurate assessments. There
are various ways to facilitate this accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at
the average grade each grader gives; those giving much higher average grades might be the easy
graders. Similarly helpful are “forced rankings,” in which people must rank coworker performance
from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as “grading on a curve.” Metrics
that allow for independent grading across departments and/or groups are especially valuable.
3) Surveys (of workers and of customers).

... 145) The most common reason problems aren’t perceived is what I call the “frog in
the boiling water” problem. Supposedly, if you throw a frog in a pot of boiling water it will

immediately jump out. But if you put a frog in room-temperature water and gradually bring the water to a

99

Part 3: My Management Principles

Know How to Perceive Problems Effectively
boil, the frog will stay in place and boil to death. There is a strong tendency to get used to and accept very
bad things that would be shocking if seen with fresh eyes.

... 146) In some cases, people accept unacceptable problems because they are
perceived as being too difficult to fix. Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually
a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable.

They will lead to chronic unacceptable results, stress, more work, and possibly get you fired. So remember
one of the first principles of management: you either have to fix problems or escalate them (if need be, over
and over again) if you can't fix them. There is no other, or easier, alternative.
146a) Problems that have good, planned solutions are completely different from those that don’t.
The spectrum of badness versus goodness with problems looks like this:
a) They’re unidentified (worst);
b) Identified but without a planned solution (better);
c) Identified with a good, planned solution (good); and
d) Solved (best).
However, the worst situation for morale is the second case: identified but without a planned solution.
So it’s really important to identify which of these categories the problem belongs to.

Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of

147) Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are
Symptomatic Of
So…
... 148) Recognize that all problems are just manifestations of their root causes, so
diagnose to understand what the problems are symptomatic of. Don’t deal with your

problems as one-offs. They are outcomes produced by your machine, which consists of design and people.
If the design is excellent and the people are excellent, the outcomes will be excellent (though not perfect).
So when you have problems, your diagnosis should look at the design and the people to determine what
failed you and why.

... 149) Understand that diagnosis is foundational both to progress and quality
relationships. An honest and collaborative exploration of problems with the people around you will give

you a better understanding of why these problems occur so that they can be fixed. You will also get to
know each other better, be yourself, and see whether the people around you are reasonable and/or enforce
their reasonableness. Further, you will help your people grow and vice versa. So, this process is not only
what good management is; it is also the basis for personal and organizational evolution and the way to
establish deep and meaningful relationships. Because it starts and ends with how you approach mistakes, I
hope that I have conveyed why I believe this attitude about and approach to dealing with mistakes is so
important.

... 150) Ask the following questions when diagnosing. These questions are intended to look at the

problem (i.e., the outcome that was inconsistent with the goal) as a manifestation of your “machine.” It does
this first by examining how the responsible parties imagined that the machine would have worked, then
examining how it did work, and then examining the inconsistencies. If you get adept at the process, it
should take 10 to 20 minutes. As previously mentioned, it should be done constantly so that you have a
large sample size and no one case is a big deal.
1) Ask the person who experienced the problem: What suboptimality did you experience?
2) Ask the manager of the area: Is there a clear responsible party for the machine as a whole who can
describe the machine to you and answer your questions about how the machine performed compared
with expectations? Who owns this responsibility?
• Do not mask personal responsibility—use specific names.
3) Ask the responsible party: What is the “mental map” of how it was supposed to work?
• A “mental map” is essentially the visualization of what should have happened.

•

To be practical, “mental maps” (i.e., the designs that you would have expected would have
worked well) should account for the fact that people are imperfect. They should lead to
success anyway.

4) Ask the owner of the responsibility: What, if anything, broke in this situation? Were there problems with
the design (i.e., who is supposed to do what) or with how the people in the design behaved?
• Compare the mental map of “what should have happened” to “what did happen” in order
to identify the gap.
• If the machine steps were followed, ask, “Is the machine designed well?” If not, what’s
wrong with the machine?
5) Ask the people involved why they handled the issue the way they did. What are the proximate causes
of the problem (e.g., “Did not do XYZ”)? They will be described using verbs—for example, “Harry did
XYZ.” What are the root causes? They will be descriptions. For example: inadequate
training/experience, lack of vision, lack of ability, lack of judgment, etc. In other words, root cause is not
an action or a reaction—it is a reason.
• Be willing to touch the nerve.
6) Ask the people involved: Is this broadly consistent with prior patterns (yes/no/unsure)? What is the
systematic solution? How should the people / machines / responsibilities evolve as a result of this
issue?
• Confirm that the short-term resolution of the issue has been addressed.
• Determine the steps to be taken for long-term solutions and who is responsible for those
steps. Specifically:
a. Are there responsibilities that need either assigning or greater clarification?
b. Are there machine designs that need to be reworked?
c. Are there people whose fit for their roles needs to be evaluated?

... 151) Remember that a root cause is not an action but a reason. It is described by using

adjectives rather than verbs. Keep asking “why” to get at root causes, and don’t forget to examine problems
with people. In fact, since most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not
do them a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people, especially “the responsible
party.” When the problem is attributable to a person, you have to ask why the person made the mistake to
get at the real root cause, and you need to be as accurate in diagnosing a fault in a person as you are in
diagnosing a fault in a piece of equipment.
For example, a root cause discovery process might proceed like this:
- “The problem was due to bad programming.”
- “Why was there bad programming?”
- “Because Harry programmed it badly.”
- “Why did Harry program it badly?”
- “Because he wasn’t well trained and because he was in a rush.”
- “Why wasn’t he well trained? Did his manager know that he wasn’t well trained and let him do the job
anyway, or did he not know?”

Ultimately it will come down to what the people or the design is like.

... 152) Identify at which step failure occurred in the 5-Step Process. If a person is chronically
failing it is due to either lack of training or lack of ability. Which was it? At which of the five steps did the
person fail? Different steps require different abilities.

1. Setting goals: This requires big-picture thinking, vision, and values that are consistent with those of our
community. (It is helpful to ask whether the responsible party lost sight of the goals or whether he or she set
goals that are inconsistent with Bridgewater’s.)

2. Perceiving problems: This requires perception, the ability to synthesize, and an intolerance of badness
(i.e., some people see badness but aren’t sufficiently bothered by it to push themselves to eliminate it). Of
course, having perspective (typically gained via experience) helps at all steps.
3. Diagnosis: This requires logic, assertiveness, and open-mindedness. You must be willing to have open
and/or difficult discussions to get at the truth.
4. Design: This requires creativity and practical visualization.
5. Doing the tasks: This requires determination and self-discipline.
If you 1) identify at which of these steps the chronic failures are occurring and 2) see which, if any, of these
abilities the person is short of, you will go a long way toward diagnosing the problem.

... 153) Remember that a proper diagnosis requires a quality, collaborative, and honest
discussion to get at the truth. Don’t just give your verdict without exploring the mistake, because

there’s a reasonably high probability that you don’t know the answer. Do not be arrogant. You might have a
theory about what happened, and that theory should be explored with relevant others. If you and others are
open-minded, you will almost certainly have a quality analysis that will give everyone working theories to
explore or you will reach conclusions that can be used for the design phase. And if you do this whenever
problems recur, you and others involved will eventually uncover the root causes.

... 154) Keep in mind that diagnoses should produce outcomes. Otherwise there’s no purpose

in them. The outcome might not take the form of an agreement, but at a minimum it should take the form of
theories about root causes (which should be written down so you have a collection of synthesized dots to
use for identifying patterns) and clarity about what should be done in the future to protect against them, or
to gather information to find out.

... 155) Don’t make too much out of one “dot”—synthesize a richer picture by squeezing
lots of “dots” quickly and triangulating with others. A dot is a particular outcome. When you
diagnose to understand the reason it occurred, you are “squeezing” the dot. Don’t try to squeeze too much
out of a single dot—it can only tell you so much. Rather, try to collect and squeeze a bunch of dots in an
80/20 way, triangulating with the dots of others, so that you can synthesize a pointillist painting of what the
person is like.

... 156) Maintain an emerging synthesis by diagnosing continuously—You must be able to

categorize, understand, and observe the evolution of the different parts of your machine/system through
time, and synthesize this understanding into a picture of how your machine is working and how it should be
modified to improve. But if you don’t look into the significant bad outcomes as they occur, you won’t really
understand what they are symptomatic of, nor will you be able to understand how things are changing
through time (e.g., if they are improving or worsening).

... 157) To distinguish between a capacity issue and a capability issue, imagine how the
person would perform at that particular function if they had ample capacity. Think
back on how they performed in similar functions when they had ample capacity.

... 158) The most common reasons managers fail to produce excellent results or
escalate are:
a. They are too removed.
b. They have problems discerning quality differences.

c. They have lost sight of how bad things have become because they have gradually gotten used to
their badness (the “frog in the boiling water problem”).
d. They have such high pride in their work that they can’t bear to admit they are unable to solve their
own problems.
e. They fear adverse consequences from admitting failure.

... 159) Avoid “Monday morning quarterbacking.” That is, evaluate the merits of a past decision

based on what you know now versus what you could have reasonably known at the time of the decision.
Do this by asking yourself, “What should a quality person have known and done in that situation?” Also,
have a deep understanding of the person who made the decision (how do they think, what type of person
are they, did they learn from the situation, etc).

... 160) Identify the principles that were violated. Identify which of these principles apply to the case
at hand, review them, and see if they would have helped. Think for yourself what principles are best for
handling cases like this. This will help solve not only this problem but it will also help you solve other
problems like it.

... 161) Remember that if you have the same people doing the same things, you should
expect the same results.
... 162) Use the following “drilldown” technique to gain an 80/20 understanding of a
department or sub-department that is having problems. A drilldown is the process by which
someone who wants to do so can gain a deep enough understanding of the problems in an area as well as
the root causes, so that they can then go on to design a plan to make the department or sub-department
excellent. It is not a “diagnosis,” which is done for each problem. A manager doing ongoing diagnosis will
naturally understand his areas well and won’t have to do a drilldown. Drilling down is a form of probing,
though it is broader and deeper. Done well, it should get you almost all the information needed to turn a
department around in about five hours of effort.

A drilldown takes place in two distinct steps: 1) listing problems and 2) listing causes/diagnosing. It is
followed by 3) designing a plan. If done well, getting informed via the first two steps typically takes about
four hours (give or take an hour), with the first step of listing the problems typically taking one to two hours
and the second step of diagnosing them typically taking two to four hours, if done efficiently.
It’s very important that these steps are done separately and independently. That’s because going into two
or three directions at the same time causes confusion and doesn’t allow adequate discussion of each of the
possible causes and solutions.
Having the people from the area under scrutiny actively participate in all three steps is critical. You need to
hear their descriptions and allow them to argue with you when they think you are wrong. This way you are
much more likely to come up with an accurate diagnosis and a good plan.
After the drilldown, you will create the plan or design, which typically takes two to three hours. So the whole
process, from asking the first question to coming up with the detailed plan, typically takes about five to eight
hours spread over three or four meetings. Then there is step four—the executing, monitoring, and
modifying of the plan—which typically takes six to 12 months.
Here is more detail on each of the steps:
Step 1—List the problems. Don’t confuse problems with possible solutions. Sometimes problems occur
for rare or insignificant reasons because nothing is perfect. Don’t pay much attention to those. But more
often than not, they are symptomatic of something malfunctioning in your machine, so it pays to investigate
what that is. For example, not having enough capacity is not a “problem”; it might cause problems, but it’s
not a problem. Having people work so late that they might quit, getting out reports too late, etc., might be

© 2011 Ray Dalio

104

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems
Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of
problems that are caused by a lack of capacity. But the lack of capacity itself is not a problem. To fix
problems, you need to start with the specific problems and address them one by one and come up with
very specific solutions. That’s because there are lots of ways to solve problems. The problem of people
working late at night might be solved by gaining capacity, or it might be solved by shifting work to another
department, or by doing less, etc. To assume that lack of capacity is the problem could lead to inferior
problem-solving. So unless you keep in mind the very specific problems, you will not be effective at solving
them. In the process of solving problems, you will often see that several problems are due to the same
cause (e.g., lack of capacity, a shortage of tech resources, bad management, etc.), but that is not the same
thing as starting at the more general level (like saying that bad management or lack of capacity, etc., are
problems), which is why I am saying you must start with very specific problems before making
generalizations. For example, when you have a “people problem,” be specific. Specify which people you
are having what problems with and avoid the tendency of saying things like, “People in operations aren’t…”
Avoid the tendency not to name names for fear of offending.
Step 2—Identify root causes. Root causes are the deep-seated reasons behind the actions that caused
the problems. It is important to distinguish between proximate causes, which are superficial reasons for
what happened (e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule”), and root causes (e.g.,
“I didn’t check the schedule because I am forgetful”). Typically a proximate cause is the action that led to
the problem while a root cause is the fundamental reason that action occurred. So, when diagnosing, if you
are describing what happened or didn’t happen to cause the problem, you are probably describing
proximate causes. When you start describing the qualities that were behind these actions, you are probably
getting at the root causes. To get at the root cause, keep asking why. For example, if the problem is that
people are working late and the direct cause was that there wasn’t enough capacity, then ask why there
wasn’t enough capacity. Then you will get closer to the root cause.
If your machine is producing outcomes that you don’t want, either the design is flawed or the parts/people
that you dropped into the design are malfunctioning. Most, but not all, problems happen because 1) it isn’t
clear who the “responsible party” is for making sure things go well 68 or 2) the responsible party isn’t
handling his or her responsibilities well (in other words, isn’t operating according to the principles to
eliminate the problem). So first ask, “Is it clear who the responsible party is?” If not, specify that. If it is
clear, then ask, “Why isn’t he or she doing a good job?” There are two possible reasons for someone doing
a poor job: insufficient training or insufficient ability.
Though it is essential to connect problems to the responsible parties, this can be difficult if the responsible
parties don’t acknowledge their mistakes and fail to diagnose why they made the mistakes. Still, clarity
about responsibility and the problems’ root causes must be achieved because otherwise there is no hope
for improvement. If the responsible parties do not explicitly take responsibility for ensuring that their areas
operate smoothly, their areas will not operate smoothly. An important first step toward achieving clarity is to
remove the mentality of blame and credit, because it stands in the way of accurately understanding
problems, and that’s a prerequisite for producing improvements. Also, it is important not to judge too
quickly what the root causes are. Instead, you should observe the patterns of problems using the issues log
as a tool and discuss with the responsible parties what the root causes might be each time a problem
arises. You probably won’t initially be able to come to conclusions with a high degree of confidence,
because there are many possible reasons for any one problem. But over time, the problems’ patterns and
causes will become clear to everyone.
As mentioned, there are two possible reasons why the responsible party handled something badly: 1) the
responsible party didn’t encounter this problem enough times previously to learn from it and prevent it in
the future (by using the principles) or 2) the responsible party is unsuited for that job. And there are also
two possible reasons the person is not suited for that job: 1) not enough experience or training and 2) lack

68

Which would be because the manager—the responsible party for making it clear who is responsible for what—is failing to do that well.

Part 3: My Management Principles

Diagnose to Understand What the Problems Are Symptomatic Of
of values and/or abilities required to do the job well. So getting at the root causes is largely a matter of
figuring out:
1. Who is the responsible party for what went wrong?
2. Did that person encounter the problem enough times that he or she should have either learned how
not to repeat it or elevated it to someone who could have helped learn how to solve it? The
conclusions could be the following: 1) If the person did encounter the problem enough times to
have resolved or elevated it, then the person is not suitable for the job 69;2) if the person did not
encounter the problems enough times to resolve or elevate it, what are the probable root causes?
The most common root causes are: 1) the person is not suitable for the job in some way (doesn’t
learn from mistakes, doesn’t have a high sense of responsibility, is lazy, etc.); 2) the design of the
process is flawed (e.g., the person is doing things in a way that can be improved); or 3) there is no
possible solution. If it’s the first root cause, the person should have their job changed; if it’s the
second, you and the person need to properly diagnose the problem and come up with a different
process that will work; and if it’s the third, you won’t know that until you have thoroughly explored
whether the process can be remediated.
That second alternative of trying to find a better process takes time and patience (involving you and
the person properly diagnosing the problem and finding a different approach that works). Normally,
this is the point at which most companies and people fail. That is because people often take the
identification of a “mistake” as the equivalent of an accusation that they are flawed (dumb, lazy,
etc.), so they become defensive. If instead they view the exercise as an investigation into how the
process might be flawed, it’s easier to make progress. So when criticizing, it’s sometimes helpful to
convey explicitly the point of the exercise: mutually diagnosing the problem and exploring the pros
and cons of alternative approaches. You both need to be mindful that doing this well typically takes
time and patience. One of the purposes of the brainstorming session is to do this, ideally with an
agreed diagnosis resulting from it.
Step 3—Create a plan (brief notes):
-Look at each root cause and ask yourself what should be done about it.
-Creating a plan is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time in order to
achieve the goal.
-Step away from the group to reflect and work on the plan, then bring it back to the group to discuss and
modify.
-When developing the plan, iterate through multiple possibilities and play them out in time to help determine
the best choice.
-Make sure to assign who is supposed to do what with rough target dates for achieving individual tasks of
the plan. Once the plan design is complete, make sure the tasks, responsible parties, and timelines are
reasonable and doable.
-While everyone does not need to agree with the plan, it is important that the key people agree that it will
work.
Step 4—Implement the plan (brief notes):
- Give each person a monthly to-do list to provide clarity and transparency around responsibilities and
expectations for that month. Then plot the progress in open, monthly meetings with all the relevant parties.
Explicitly assess how the plan is working and deal with problems that aren’t being resolved.
-Make sure to hold responsible parties accountable for target dates and develop metrics around how they
are meeting their commitments.

69

That doesn’t mean that all people have to solve and prevent all repeating problems or they shouldn’t be in their jobs. That might not be
possible because smaller, repeating problems might be consciously accepted until they become high enough priorities to be fixed. However, it
does mean that repeating problems should be recognized and, if not able to be resolved, they must be elevated.

-Regularly look at that list of assigned tasks to track progress and determine if any adjustments are
needed.
-Create transparency around the plan by posting it publicly and reviewing it regularly with the group. This
helps people see the ways in which all of the problems are being addressed and reinforces accountability.
Do not exclude any relevant people from the drilldown: besides losing the benefit of their ideas, you
disenfranchise these people from the game plan and reduce their sense of ownership.
Remember that people tell you things they want and tend not to be self-critical. It is your job as a
manager to get at truth and excellence, not to make people happy. For example, the correct path might
be to fire some people and replace them with better people, or to put people in jobs they might not want,
etc. The brainstorming session must include a discussion of people’s weaknesses and failings to get at
truth and excellence. Everyone’s objective must be to get at the best answer, not the answer that will make
people happy. This is especially true for managers. In the long run, the best answers will be the ones that
make the people we want to be at Bridgewater happiest.

To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems
Put Things in Perspective

163) Put Things in Perspective
So…
... 164) Go back before going forward. Before moving forward, take the time to reflect on how the

machine worked. By diagnosing what went right and what went wrong (especially what went wrong), you
can see how the machine is operating and how it should be improved. People who are just focused on
what they should do next are overly focused on the tasks at hand and not on how the machine is working;
so they don’t make sustainable progress.

Go back by “telling the story” to help put things in perspective. Sometimes people have problems putting
current conditions into perspective or projecting into the future. Sometimes they disagree on cause-effect
relationships, or focus on details rather than addressing the big picture. Sometimes they forget who or what
caused things to go well or poorly. By asking them to “tell the story” of how we got here, or by “telling the
story” yourself, you put where you are in perspective. Doing this highlights important items that were done
well or poorly in relation to their consequences, draws attention to the overarching goals, and helps achieve
agreement. By telling the story from the past to the present, it will help you continue it into the future (i.e.,
design a plan). Making a good plan involves sketching out the important events through time and thinking
through the specifics in sequence so that when you are done, the final story is vivid and easy to visualize.
Then other people can understand the plan, comment on it, and eventually believe in it. It’s also required
for specifying who should do what and when.
164a) Tool: Have all new employees listen to tapes of “the story” to bring them up to date. Listen to
some of the associated tapes about Bridgewater’s story. Imagine how much better informed you
would be than a person who just joined Bridgewater and hadn’t listened to these stories.

... 165) Understand “above the line” and “below the line” thinking and how to navigate
between the two. There are different levels and themes going on in any one conversation. It is

important to know how to navigate them. If you imagine main points and subordinate points organized in
outline form, an above-the-line discussion addresses the main points. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
reference details, because some details might be necessary to the discussion. But reference details solely
for the purpose of understanding major points rather than dissecting minor points.

For example, suppose your major point is: “Sally can do that job well.” In an above-the-line conversation,
the discussion of her qualities would target the question of Sally’s capacity to do her job. As soon as
agreement was reached on whether she could perform competently, you would pass to the next major
point—such as what qualities are required for that job. In contrast, a below-the-line discussion would focus
on Sally’s qualities for their own sake, without relating them to whether she can do her job well. The
discussion might cover qualities that are irrelevant to the job. While both levels of discussion touch on
minor points, “above the line” discourse will always move coherently from one major point to the next in
much the same way as you can read an outline in order to fully understand the whole concept and reach a
conclusion. You go “below the line” to the minor points only to illustrate something important about the
major points and progress in an orderly and accurate way to the conclusion. Your ability to do this is
partially innate but can be improved with practice. 70

70

Good conceptual thinkers naturally see things in this outline-like form and know how to navigate. They know whether they are having an
above-the-line conversation and appropriately delving, and they know how to navigate between both levels. Poor conceptual thinkers tend to
get confused because they see things as one big pile of information from which they pick data points almost at random.

Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals

166) Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals
So…
... 167) Remember: You are designing a “machine” or system that will produce
outcomes. This machine will consist of distinct parts (i.e., people and other resources as well as the way
they interact with each other).

167a) A short-term goal probably won’t require you to build a machine. But for an ongoing mission,
you will need a well-designed and efficient machine.
167b) Beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and not enough attention to
what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve your goals.
Constantly compare your machine’s outcomes to your goals in order to reflect on how well the
machine is operating. Examine both the design and how the individual parts are functioning.

... 168) Don’t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan. Take at least a
few hours to think through your plan. Those hours will be virtually nothing in relation to the amount of time
that will be spent doing, and they will make the doing radically more effective.

... 169) The organizational design you draw up should minimize problems and maximize
capitalization on opportunities. Make the design an extension of your understanding of your
problems and opportunities.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems
Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals

... 170) Put yourself in the “position of pain” for a while so that you gain a richer
understanding of what you’re designing for. Temporarily insert yourself into the flow to gain a

real understanding of what you are dealing with (the process flow, the type of people needed, the potential
problems, etc.) and to visualize a clear picture of what will work. You can accomplish this in a number of
ways (reviewing work, doing work at different stages in the process, etc.).

... 171) Recognize that design is an iterative process; between a bad “now” and a good
“then” is a “working through it” period. That “working through it” period involves trying

processes and people out, seeing what goes well or poorly, learning from the iterations, and moving toward
having the right people in the ideal systematic design. Even with a good future design picture in mind, it will
naturally take time, testing, mistakes, and learning to get to a good “then” state.

... 172) Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose. A good

designer is able to visualize the machine and its outcomes accurately, though imperfectly. First visualize
the parts and their interactions, and then find the parts to fit the design. Look at all the system’s pieces and
their interactions. Imagine how goals 1, 2, and 3 can be achieved. Imagine how Harry, Larry, and Sally can
operate in various ways with various tools and different incentives and penalties in place to achieve those
goals. Then imagine how the system would work differently if you replaced Harry with George, or if it was
configured in an entirely different way. Do this iteratively. Think through what the products and people and
finances will look like month by month (or quarter by quarter) over the next year given one system; then
change the system and visualize the outcomes again. At the end of this process, your plan should look like
a realistic movie script, which describes the parties and their interactions through time. Remember that
everything takes longer and costs more than you plan for. Recognize that some people are relatively better
or worse at visualization. Accurately assess your own abilities and those of others so you can use the most
capable people to create the visualization.

... 173) Think about second- and third-order consequences as well as first-order
consequences. The outcome you get as a first-order consequence might be desirable (or undesirable),
while the second- or third-order consequences could be the opposite, so focusing solely on first-order
consequences, which people tend to do, could lead to bad decision-making. Though I might not like the
first-order consequences of a rainy day, I might love the second-order consequences. So if I were in a
position to choose whether or not there should be rainy days, I would need to look at the second- and thirdorder consequences to make the right decision. For example, for every person you plan to hire, you will
have to hire more to support them. I call this “The 1.6 Effect.”

... 174) Most importantly, build the organization around goals rather than tasks. As an

example of building the organization around goals rather than tasks, we have traditionally had a marketing
department (goal: to market) that is separate from our client service department (goal: to service clients),
even though they do similar things and there would be advantages to having them work together. But
because marketing and servicing clients are two distinct goals, we have a separate department for each. If
they were merged, the department head, salespeople, client advisors, analysts, and others would be giving
and receiving conflicting feedback. If asked why clients were receiving relatively poor attention, the answer
might be: “We have incentives to raise sales.” Asked why they weren’t making sales, the merged
department might explain that they need to take care of their clients. Keeping the two areas separate gives
each department a clear focus and the appropriate resources to achieve its goals, makes the diagnosis of
resource allocations more straightforward, and reduces “job slip.” Of course, when building departments
around goals, your goals have to be the right size to warrant these resources. An organization might not be
big enough to warrant having a few salesmen and its own analytical group. Bridgewater has successfully
evolved from a one-cell organization, in which most people were involved in everything, to the current multicell organization because we retained our ability to efficiently focus as the organization grew. Also, I want
to make clear that temporarily sharing or rotating resources is OK, and is not the same thing as a merging
of responsibilities. I will discuss merging later in this document, as well the coordination required to
maintain focus in large organizations.

To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems
Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals
174a) First come up with the best workflow design, sketch it out in an organizational chart,
visualize how the parts interact, specify what qualities are required for each job, and, only
after that is done, choose the right people to fill the jobs (based on how their capabilities and
desires match up with the requirements).
174b) Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings. Some
groups naturally gravitate toward one another. Trying to impose your own structure without
acknowledging these magnetic pulls is ineffective and likely will result in a bad outcome.
174c) Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the
resources they need to achieve the goals. We do this because we don’t want to create a
bureaucracy that forces departments to requisition resources from a pool that lacks the focus to do
the job. People sometimes argue that we should have a technology department, but I am against that
because building technology is a task, not a goal in and of itself. You build technology to perform
valuable tasks. If we kept the tech resources outside the department, we would have people from
various departments arguing about whose project is most important in order to garner resources,
which isn’t good for efficiency. The tech people would be evaluated and managed by bureaucrats
rather than the people they do the work for.
174d) The efficiency of an organization decreases and the bureaucracy of an organization
increases in direct relation to the increase in the number of people and/or the complexity of
the organization.

... 175) Build your organization from the top down. An organization is the opposite of a building—

the foundation is at the top. The head of the organization is responsible for designing the organization and
for choosing people to fill its boxes. Therefore, make sure you hire managers before their direct reports.
Managers can then help design the machine and choose people who complement the machine.
175a) Everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards. Without this
strong oversight, there is potential for inadequate quality control, inadequate training, and inadequate
appreciation of excellent work. Do not “just trust” people to do their jobs well.
175b) The people at the top of each pyramid should have the skills and focus to manage their
direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs. Here’s an example of the confusion that
can arise when that understanding is absent: It was proposed that the head of technology have the
facilities group (the people who take care of facilities like the building, lunches, office supplies, etc.)
report to him because both are, in a sense, “facilities” and because they have some things in
common, such as the electrical supply. But the head of technology didn’t understand what the
facilities people do. Having people who are responsible for the janitorial services and meals reporting
to a technology manager is as inappropriate as having the technology people report to the person
who is taking care of facilities. These functions, even if they’re considered “facilities” in the broadest
sense, are very different, as are the respective skill sets. Similarly, at another time, we talked about
combining folks who work on client agreements with those who do counterparty agreements under
one manager. That would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with
clients are very different from the ones required to reach agreements with counterparties. It was
wrong to conflate both departments under the general heading of “agreements,” because each kind
called for specific knowledge and skills.
175c) The ratio of senior managers to junior managers and to the number of people who work two
levels below should be limited, to preserve quality communication and mutual understanding.
Generally, the ratio should not be more than 1:10, and preferably closer to 1:5. Of course, the
appropriate ratio will vary depending on how many people your direct reports have reporting to them,
the complexity of the jobs they’re doing, and the manager’s ability to handle several people or
projects at once.

175d) The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to their direct reports
will limit the size of an effective organization.
175e) The larger the organization, the more important are 1) information technology expertise in
management and 2) cross-department communication (more on these later).
175f) Do not build the organization to fit the people. Jobs are created based on the work that needs to
be done, not what people want to do or what people are available. You can always search outside
Bridgewater to find the people who “click” best for a particular role.

... 176) Have the clearest possible delineation of responsibilities and reporting lines. It’s

required both within and between departments. Make sure reporting lines and designated responsibilities
are clear. To avoid confusion, people should not report to two different departments. Dual reporting
(reporting across department lines) causes confusion, complicates prioritization, diminishes focus on clear
goals, and muddies the lines of supervision and accountability, especially when a person reports to two
people in two different departments. When situations require dual reporting, managers need to be
informed. Asking someone from another department to do a task without consulting with his or her
manager is strictly prohibited (unless the request will take less than an hour or so). However, appointing coheads of a department or a sub-department can work well if the managers are in synch and combine
complementary and essential strengths to this area; dual reporting in that case can work fine if properly
coordinated by the co-heads.
176a) Create an organizational chart to look like a pyramid, with straight lines down that don’t
cross. A series of descending pyramids make up the whole pyramid, but the number of layers should
be limited to minimize hierarchy.

... 177) Constantly think about how to produce leverage. For example, to make training as easy to
leverage as possible, document the most common questions and answers through audio, video, or written
guidelines and then assign someone to regularly organize them into a manual. Technology can do most
tasks, so think creatively about how to design tools that will provide leverage for you and the people who
work for you.

177a) You should be able to delegate the details away. If you can’t, you either have problems with
managing or training or you have the wrong people doing the job. The real sign of a master manager
is that he doesn’t have to “do” practically anything. Of course, a great manager has to hire and
oversee the people who do things; but a “supreme master” manager can even hire a person or two to
do this and has achieved such leverage that things are effortlessly running superbly. Of course, there
is a continuum related to this. The main message I’m trying to convey is that managers should strive
to hire, train, and oversee in a way in which others can superbly handle as much as possible on their
own. Managers should view the need to get involved in the nitty-gritty themselves as a bad sign.
177b) It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have a
greater number of ordinary and less well-equipped people. First of all, great people and great
technology are almost always a great value because their effectiveness in enhancing the
organization’s productivity can be enormous. Second, it is desirable to have smart people have the
widest possible span of understanding and control because fragmented understanding and control
create inefficiencies and undermine organizational cohesion. Usually it is the person’s capacity that
limits the scope of his understanding and control. So the mix of really smart people operating with
really great technology in a streamlined organization is optimal for organizational efficiency.
177c) Use “leveragers.” Leveragers are capable of doing a lot to get your concepts implemented.
Conceptualizing and managing are most important and take only about 10% of the time needed for
implementing; so if you have good leveragers, you can accomplish a lot more with relative ease.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Perceive, Diagnose, and Solve Problems
Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals

... 178) Understand the clover-leaf design. Find two or three responsible parties who have overlapping

believabilities and responsibilities and who are willing to challenge and check each other. If you do this, and
those people are willing to fight for what they believe is best by being open-minded and assertive at the
same time, and if they escalate their disagreements and failures to you, this process will have a high
probability of sorting issues that they can probably handle well from issues that you should examine and
resolve with them.

... 179) Don’t do work for people in another department or grab people from another
department to do work for you unless you speak to the boss.
... 180) Watch out for “department slip.” This happens when a support department, such as HR or

Facilities, mistakes its responsibilities to provide support with a responsibility to determine how the thing
they are supporting should be done. An example of this sort of mistake is if those in the Recruiting
department think they should determine whom we should hire or if people in HR think they should
determine what our employment policies should be. Another example would be if the Facilities group
determined what facilities we should have. While support departments should know the goals of the people
they’re supporting and provide feedback regarding possible choices, they are not the ones to determine the
vision.

... 181) Assign responsibilities based on workflow design and people’s abilities, not job
titles. What people do should primarily be a function of the job they have, and it should be pretty obvious
who should do what (if they’re suited for the job). For example, just because someone is responsible for
“human resources,” “recruiting,” “legal,” “programming,” etc., doesn’t necessarily mean they are the
appropriate person to do everything associated with those functions. For example, though “Human
Resources” people help with hiring, firing, and providing benefits, it would be a mistake to give them the
responsibility of determining who gets hired and fired and what benefits are provided to employees. When
assigning responsibilities, think about both the workflow design and a person’s abilities, not the job title.

... 182) Watch out for consultant addiction. Beware of the chronic use of consultants to do work that
should be done by employees.

... 183) Tool: Maintain a procedures manual. This is the document in which you describe how all of

the pieces of your machine work. There needs to be enough specificity so that operators of the different
pieces of the machine can refer to the manual to help them do their job. The manual should be a living
document that includes output from the issues log so that mistakes already identified and diagnosed aren’t
repeated. It prevents forgetting previous learning and facilitates communication.

... 184) Tool: Use checklists. When people are assigned tasks, it is generally desirable to have these

captured on checklists so they can check off each item as it is done. If not, there is a risk that people will
gradually not do the agreed tasks or there will be lack of clarity. Crossing items off a checklist will serve as
a task reminder and confirmation of what has been done.
184a) Don’t confuse checklists with personal responsibility. People should be expected to do their
job well, not just what is on their checklists.
184b) Remember that “systematic” doesn’t necessarily mean computerized. It might mean having
people do specified tasks and indicate that they have done them with checklists.
184c) Use “double-do” rather than “double-check” to make sure mission-critical tasks are done
correctly. When people double-check someone else’s work, there is a much lower rate of catching
errors than when two parties independently do the work and the results are compared. Double-doing
is having two different people doing the same task on the same job so that two independent answers
are derived. By comparing them you will not only assure better answers but you will see the

differences in people’s performances and make much more rapid improvement. I use double-dos in
critical areas such as finance, where large amounts of money are involved.

... 185) Watch out for “job slip.”Job slip is when a job changes without being explicitly thought through

and agreed to, generally because of changing circumstances or a temporary necessity. Job slip will
generally cause bad job design. It often leads to the wrong people handling the wrong responsibilities and
confusion over who is supposed to do what.

... 186) Think clearly how things should go, and when they aren’t going that way,
acknowledge it and investigate. First decide which issue to address first: finding the reason the

machine isn’t working well or executing the tasks required to get past the problem (in which case you need
to come back to the reasons later). Either way, don’t pass the problem by without discussing the reasons.
Otherwise, you will end up with job slip.

... 187) Have good controls so that you are not exposed to the dishonesty of others and
trust is never an issue. A higher percentage of the population than you might imagine will cheat if

given an opportunity, and most people who are given the choice of being “fair” with you and taking more for
themselves will choose taking more for themselves. Even a tiny amount of cheating is intolerable, so your
happiness and success will depend on your controls. Security controls should be viewed as a necessary
tool of our profession, not as a personal affront to an individual’s integrity. Just as a bank teller doesn’t view
a check on the money in his drawer as an indication that the bank thinks he is dishonest, everyone here
should understand the need for our security controls. Explain this to your people so they see it in the proper
context. Even the best controls will never be foolproof, and trustworthiness is a quality that should be
appreciated.
187a) People doing auditing should report to people outside the department being audited, and
auditing procedures should not be made known to those being audited.
187b) Remember: There is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors).

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with Not Knowing

To Make Decisions Effectively…
190) Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with
Not Knowing
So…
... 191) Recognize that your goal is to come up with the best answer, that the probability
of your having it is small, and that even if you have it, you can’t be confident that
you do have it unless you have other believable people test you.
... 192) Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is far more powerful than
knowing. That is because there’s way more that we don’t know than what we could possibly ever know.
192a) Embrace the power of asking: “What don’t I know, and what should I do about it?” Generally
you should find believable people and ask their advice, remembering that you are looking to
understand their reasoning rather than get their conclusions.
192b) Finding the path to success is at least as dependent on coming up with the right questions
as coming up with answers. Successful people are great at asking the important questions and
then finding the answers. When faced with a problem, they first ask themselves if they know all the
important questions about it; they are objective in assessing the probability that they have the
answers; and they are good at open-mindedly seeking believable people to ask.

... 193) Remember that your goal is to find the best answer, not to give the best one you
have. The answer doesn’t have to be in your head; you can look outside of you. In life the goal is for you
to do the right thing, considering the probability that you might be wrong. So it is invaluable to know what
you don’t know so that you can figure out a way to find out and/or to get help from others.

... 194) While everyone has the right to have questions and theories, only believable
people have the right to have opinions. If you can’t successfully ski down a difficult slope, you

shouldn’t tell others how to do it, though you can ask questions about it and even express your views about
possible ways if you make clear that you are unsure.

... 195) Constantly worry about what you are missing. Even if you acknowledge you are a “dumb

shit” and are following the principles and are designing around your weaknesses, understand that you still
might be missing things. You will get better and be safer this way.
195a) Successful people ask for the criticism of others and consider its merit.
195b) Triangulate your view. Never make any important decisions without asking at least three
believable people. Don’t ask them for their conclusions or just do what they tell you to do.
Understand, visualize, and assess their reasoning to see if it makes sense to you. Ask them to probe
your own reasoning. That’s critical to your learning as well as to your successful handling of your
responsibilities.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value Calculations

196) Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value
Calculations
So…
... 197) Considering both the probabilities and the payoffs of the consequences, make
sure that the probability of the unacceptable (i.e., the risk of ruin) is nil.
197a) The cost of a bad decision is equal to or greater than the reward of a good decision, so
knowing what you don’t know is at least as valuable as knowing.
197b) Recognize opportunities where there isn’t much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the
probability of the gain happening is low. It is a reality that there are always multiple possibilities
and nothing is certain. All decisions are therefore risk/reward bets. Know how to pursue fabulous
risk/reward ratios that have a huge upside and very little downside, albeit a small probability of
happening. My life has been filled with these.
197c) Understand how valuable it is to raise the probability that your decision will be right by
accurately assessing the probability of your being right. I often observe people giving opinions
as soon as they have them, which seems at about the point that they think there’s more than a 50%
chance of them being right. Often they don’t pay any attention to the value of raising the probability of
being right (e.g., from 51% to 85%) by reflecting harder on whether the answer is right and doing the
investigations and double-checking with others to make sure that the answer is right. Remember that,
in an expected value sense, raising the probability of being right (e.g., from 51% to 85%) can be
worth more than just going from probably wrong (e.g., 45%) to probably being right (e.g., 51%)
because we are all playing probabilities. Think about the effects of altering the probabilities of
achieving must-dos: if you have a 51% probability of handling a “must-do” correctly, it means that only
a bit more than half of your must-dos will be done appropriately, whereas an 85% probability of
handling a decision well means that only 15% of the must-dos will be handled badly.
197d) Don’t bet too much on anything. Make 15 or more good, uncorrelated bets.

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is

198) Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key
20% Is
So…
... 199) Distinguish the important things from the unimportant things and deal with the
important things first.
199a) Don’t be a perfectionist, because perfectionists often spend too much time on little differences at
the margins at the expense of other big, important things. Be an effective imperfectionist. Solutions
that broadly work well (e.g., how people should contact each other in the event of crises) are
generally better than highly specialized solutions (e.g., how each person should contact each other in
the event of every conceivable crisis), especially in the early stages of a plan. There generally isn’t
much gained by lots of detail relative to a good broad solution. Complicated procedures are tough to
remember, and it takes a lot of time to make such detailed plans (so they might not even be ready
when needed).
199b) Since 80% of the juice can be gotten with the first 20% of the squeezing, there are relatively
few (typically less than five) important things to consider in making a decision. For each of
them, the marginal gains of studying them past a certain point are limited.
199c) Watch out for “detail anxiety,” i.e., worrying inappropriately about unimportant, small things.
199d) Don’t mistake small things for unimportant things, because some small things can be very
important (e.g., hugging a loved one).

... 200) Think about the appropriate time to make a decision in light of the marginal
gains made by acquiring additional information versus the marginal costs of
postponing the decision. There are some decisions that are best made after acquiring more

information, and some that are best made sooner rather than later. The later a decision is made, the more
informed it can be; however, making it later can also have adverse consequences (e.g., postponing
progress). Understanding the trade-off between the marginal gains of acquiring the extra information
against the marginal costs of postponing a decision is an important factor in the timing and preparation of
decision-making.

... 201) Make sure all the “must do’s” are above the bar before you do anything else. First,
distinguish between your “must do’s” and your “like to do’s”. Don’t overlook any “must do’s,” and don’t
mistakenly slip the “like to do’s” onto the list. Then, get all the “must do’s” above the bar. Then get all the
“must do’s” excellent. If you have time, turn to the “like to do’s” and try to get them above the bar. Only if
you have time (though you certainly will not if you are thinking broadly), turn toward making things perfect.
Chances are, you won’t have to deal with the unimportant things, which is better than not having time to
deal with the important things. I often hear people say, "Wouldn’t it be good to do this or that,” referring to
nice-to-do’s rather than must-do’s that have to be above the bar. Chances are, they are being distracted
from far more important things that need to be done well.

... 202) Remember that the best choices are the ones with more pros than cons, not
those that don’t have any cons. Watch out for people who tend to argue against
something because they can find something wrong with it without properly
weighing all the pros against the cons. Such people tend to be poor decision-makers.

119

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is

... 203) Watch out for unproductively identifying possibilities without assigning them
probabilities, because it screws up prioritization. You can recognize this with phrases like

“It’s possible that...” then going on to say something that’s improbable and/or unimportant, rather than
something like, “I think there’s a good chance that…” followed by something that’s important or probable.
Almost anything is possible. All possibilities must be looked at in terms of their likelihoods and prioritized.

... 204) Understand the concept and use the phrase “by and large.” Too often I hear

discussions fail to progress when a statement is made and the person to whom it is made replies, “Not
always,” leading to a discussion of the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, a statement like “The
people in the XYZ Department are working too many hours” might lead to a response like “Not all of them
are; Sally and Bill are working normal hours,” which could lead to a discussion of whether Sally and Bill are
working too long, which derails the discussion. Because nothing is 100% true, conversations can get off
track if they turn to whether exceptions exist, which is especially foolish if both parties agree that the
statement is by and large true. To avoid this problem, the person making such statements might use the
term “by and large,” like “By and large, the people in the XYZ Department are working too many hours.”
People hearing that should consider whether it is a “by and large” statement and treat it accordingly.
204a) When you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that “It’s not totally
true,” it’s probably true enough.

120

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Synthesize

205) Synthesize
So…
... 206) Understand and connect the dots. To do this well, you have to synthesize what is going on.

Usually it takes diagnosing a few (e.g., five or so) dots of the same type to get at the true root cause so that
you can see how the machine should be modified to produce better outcomes. For example, one type of
outcome involves someone, let’s call him Harry, handling a type of responsibility (entering an order). You
will need at least a few experiences to learn about Harry doing this. It will pay for you to understand Harry
and his handling of orders and have him understand you by looking objectively at the outcomes and by
getting in synch, especially about the bad outcomes. The quality of your understanding of your machine
and its constituent parts will depend on how well you diagnose and process the important outcomes. If you
don’t do this continuously and you don’t synthesize well, you will fail. This isn’t easy.
See how the dots connect through time. This requires collecting, analyzing, and sorting lots of different
types, and it ain’t easy for most folks. Imagine a day in which eight outcomes occur. Some are good, some
bad. Let’s represent this day as follows, with each type of event represented by a letter and the quality of
the outcome represented by its height.

In order to see the day this way, you must categorize outcomes by type and quality, which will require
synthesizing a “by and large” assessment of each. If you didn’t examine the bad outcomes as they
occurred, you couldn’t understand what they are symptomatic of. Keep in mind our example is a relatively
simple one: only eight occurrences over one day. Now let’s look at what a month looks like.

121

Part 3: My Management Principles
To Make Decisions Effectively
Synthesize

Confusing, eh? Some people are much better at this than others.
In order to understand how your machine is working to achieve your goals, you have to perceive change
over time, charting improvement vs. deterioration. The chart below plots just the type X dots, which you can
see improving. As mentioned in the section on diagnosis, you must categorize, understand, and observe
the evolution of the different parts of your machine through time, and synthesize this understanding into a
picture of how your machine is working and how it should be improved. People who do this well are rare
and essential. As with most abilities, synthesizing well is partially innate and partially learned through
practice.

... 207) Understand what an acceptable rate of improvement is, and that it is the level
and not the rate of change that matters most. I often hear people say, “It’s getting better,” as

though that is good enough when “it” is both below that bar and improving at an inadequate rate. That isn’t
good enough. For example, if someone who has been getting 30s and 40s on tests raised his grade to the
50s, you could say he’s improving but the level is still woefully inadequate. Everything important you
manage has to be on a trajectory to be “above the bar” and headed for “excellent” at an acceptable pace.
For example, in the chart below, the trajectory of A might be acceptable, but B’s trajectory is not. A gets us
above the bar in an acceptable amount of time.

... 208) If your best solution isn’t good enough, think harder or escalate that you can’t
produce a solution that is good enough. A common mistake is accepting your own best solution
when it isn’t good enough.

... 209) Avoid the temptation to compromise on that which is uncompromisable. You must

have and achieve high standards. This is particularly difficult when two uncompromisable things are at
odds. At such times, there is a tendency to let one of them go. However, at such times you have to allocate
more time to figure out how to best handle this, be more creative, and ask for more input. But don’t
compromise on one of the things that shouldn’t be compromised. For example, one of the
uncompromisable things I regularly get pressure from people to compromise on is letting great people
avoid exploring their mistakes and weaknesses because they find it painful. For reasons articulated
throughout these principles, I believe we can’t compromise on this because that process of exploration is
healthy for Bridgewater, healthy for them, and key to our culture. I also believe that to allow opt-outs would
legitimatize two sets of rules and put our radically honest way of being in jeopardy. But I want great
people. 72

... 210) Don’t try to please everyone. Not everyone is going to be happy about every decision you make,
especially the decisions that say they can’t do something.

72

Everyone is wrestling with some things, but most people don’t talk about them—some people don’t like to probe you about your weaknesses
because they think it’s unkind or awkward. And it’s often difficult for us to see and accept our own weaknesses. So when you are really in
synch with others about what you’re wrestling with, that is a great step forward, because this feedback is probably true.

How the Economic Machine Works
The economy is like a machine. At the most fundamental level it is a relatively simple machine. But many people
don’t understand it – or they don’t agree on how it works – and this has led to a lot of needless economic
suffering. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template, and wrote this
piece to describe how I believe it works. My description of how the economy works is different from most
economists'. It has worked better, allowing me to anticipate the great deleveragings and market changes that
most others overlooked. I believe that is because it is more practical. Since I certainly do not want you to blindly
believe in my description of how the economic machine works, I have laid it out clearly so that you can assess the
value of it yourself. So, let’s begin.

How the Economic Machine Works: “A Transactions-Based Approach”
An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up. A transaction is a simple thing. Because there
are a lot of them, the economy looks more complex than it really is. If instead of looking at it from the top down,
we look at it from the transaction up, it is much easier to understand.
A transaction consists of the buyer giving money (or credit) to a seller and the seller giving a good, a service or a
financial asset to the buyer in exchange. A market consists of all the buyers and sellers making exchanges for
the same things – e.g., the wheat market consists of different people making different transactions for different
reasons over time. An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets. So, while seemingly
complex, an economy is really just a zillion simple things working together, which makes it look more complex
than it really is.
For any market, or for any economy, if you know the total amount of money (or credit) spent and the total
quantity sold, you know everything you need to know to understand it. For example, since the price of any good,
service or financial asset equals the total amount spent by buyers (total $) divided by the total quantity sold by
sellers (total Q), in order to understand or forecast the price of anything you just need to forecast total $ and total
Q. While in any market there are lots of buyers and sellers, and these buyers and sellers have different
motivations, the motivations of the most important buyers are usually pretty understandable and adding them up
to understand the economy isn’t all that tough if one builds from the transactions up. What I am saying is
conveyed in the simple diagram below. This perspective of supply and demand is different from the traditional
perspective in which both supply and demand are measured in quantity and the price relationship between them
is described in terms of elasticity. This difference has important implications for understanding markets.

The only other important thing to know about this part of the Template is that spending ($) can come in either of
two forms – money and credit. For example, when you go to a store to buy something you can pay with either a
credit card or cash. If you pay with a credit card you have created credit, which is a promise to deliver money at a
later date,1 whereas, if you pay with money, you have no such liability.
In brief, there are different types of markets, different types of buyers and sellers and different ways of paying
that make up the economy. For simplicity, I will put them in groups and summarize how the machine works.
Most basically:
•

All changes in economic activity and all changes in financial markets’ prices are due to changes in the
amounts of 1) money or 2) credit that are spent on them (total $), and the amounts of these items sold
(total Q). Changes in the amount of buying (total $) typically have a much bigger impact on changes in
economic activity and prices than do changes in the total amount of selling (total Q). That is because
there is nothing that’s easier to change than the supply of money and credit (total $).

•

For simplicity, let’s cluster the buyers in a few big categories. Buying can come from either 1) the private
sector or 2) the government sector. The private sector consists of “households” and businesses that can
be either domestic or foreign. The government sector most importantly consists of a) the Federal
Government,2 which spends its money on goods and services and b) the central bank, which is the only
entity that can create money and, by and large, mostly spends its money on financial assets.

Because money and credit, and through them demand, are easier to create (or stop creating) than the production
of goods and services and investment assets, we have economic and price cycles.
Seeing the economy and the markets through this ”transactions-based” perspective rather than seeing it through
the traditional economic perspective has made all the difference in the world to my understanding of what is
going on and what is likely to happen. It lets me see what is actually happening and why it’s happening in much
more granular ways than the traditional way of looking at things. I will give you a few examples:
1.

The traditional way of looking at the relationship between supply, demand and price measures both
supply and demand via the same quantity number (i.e., at any point the demand is equal to the supply
which is the amount of quantity exchanged) and the price is described as changing via what is called
velocity. There is no attention paid to the total amount of spending that occurred, who spent it, and why
they spent it. Yet, in any time and across all time frames, the relationship between the change in the
quantities exchanged and the change in the price will change based on these factors that are being
ignored. Throwing all buyers into one group (rather distinguishing between them and understanding
their motivations) and measuring their demand in terms of quantity bought (rather than in the amount
spent) and ignoring whether the spending was paid for via money or credit, creates a theoretical and
imprecise picture of the markets and the economy.

2.

Most of what economists call the velocity of money is not the velocity of money at all – it is credit
creation. Velocity is a misleading term created to explain how the amount of spending in a year (GDP)
could be paid for by a smaller amount of money. To explain this relationship, people divided the amount
of GDP by the amount of money to convey the picture that money is going around at a speed of so many
times per year, which is the called the velocity. The economy doesn’t work that way. Instead, much of
spending comes from credit creation, and credit creation doesn’t need money to go around in order to
occur. Understanding this has big implications for understanding how the economy and markets will
work. For example, whereas one who has the traditional perspective might think that a large increase in
the amount of money will be inflationary, one using a transactions based approach will understand that it

Credit can be created on the spot between consenting parties. The idea of money going around via "velocity" and adding up to nominal GDP
is a misleading description of what happens.

is the amount of spending that changes prices, so that if the increase in the amount of money is
offsetting a decrease in the amount of credit, it won’t make a difference; in fact, if the amount of credit is
contracting and the amount of money is not increased, the amount of spending will decline and prices
will fall.
This different way of looking at the economy and markets has allowed us to understand and anticipate economic
booms and busts that others using more traditional approaches have missed.

How the Market-Based System Works
As mentioned, the previously outlined economic players buy and sell both 1) goods and services and 2) financial
assets, and they can pay for them with either 1) money or 2) credit. In a market-based system, this exchange
takes place through free choice – i.e., there are “free markets” in which buyers and sellers of goods, services and
financial assets make their transactions in pursuit of their own interests. The production and purchases of
financial assets (i.e., lending and investing) is called “capital formation”. It occurs because both the buyer and
seller of these financial assets believe that the transaction is good for them. Those with money and credit provide
it to recipients in exchange for the recipients’ “promises” to pay them more. So, for this process to work well,
there must be large numbers of capable providers of capital (i.e., investors/lenders) who choose to give money
and credit to large numbers of capable recipients of capital (borrowers and sellers of equity) in exchange for the
recipients’ believable claims that they will return amounts of money and credit that are worth more than they
were given. While the amount of money in existence is controlled by central banks, the amount of credit in
existence can be created out of thin air – i.e., any two willing parties can agree to do a transaction on credit –
though this is influenced by central bank policies. In bubbles more credit is created than can be later paid back,
which creates busts.
When capital contractions occur, economic contractions also occur, i.e., there is not enough money and/or credit
spent on goods, services and financial assets. These contractions typically occur for two reasons, which are most
commonly known as recessions (which are contractions within a short-term debt cycle) and depressions (which
are contractions within deleveragings). Recessions are typically well understood because they happen often and
most of us have experienced them, whereas depressions and deleveragings are typically poorly understood
because they happen infrequently and are not widely experienced.
A short-term debt cycle, (which is commonly called the business cycle), arises from a) the rate of growth in
spending (i.e., total $ funded by the rates of growth in money and credit) being faster than the rate of growth in
the capacity to produce (i.e., total Q) leading to price (P) increases until b) the rate of growth in spending is
curtailed by tight money and credit, at which time a recession occurs. In other words, a recession is an economic
contraction that is due to a contraction in private sector debt growth arising from tight central bank policy
(usually to fight inflation), which ends when the central bank eases. Recessions end when central banks lower
interest rates to stimulate demand for goods and services and the credit growth that finances these purchases,
because lower interest rates 1) reduce debt service costs; 2) lower monthly payments (de-facto, the costs) of
items bought on credit, which stimulates the demand for them; and 3) raise the prices of income-producing
assets like stocks, bonds and real estate through the present value effect of discounting their expected cash flows
at the lower interest rates, producing a “wealth effect” on spending.
In contrast:
A long-term debt cycle, arises from debts rising faster than both incomes and money until this can’t continue
because debt service costs become excessive, typically because interest rates can’t be reduced any more. A
deleveraging is the process of reducing debt burdens (i.e., debt and debt service relative to incomes).
Deleveragings typically end via a mix of 1) debt reduction,3 2) austerity, 3) redistributions of wealth, and 4) debt
3

Debt reductions take the form of some mix of debt write-downs (so the amount of debt to be repaid is reduced), the timing of debt
payments being extended and interest rates being reduced.

monetization. A depression is the economic contraction phase of a deleveraging. It occurs because the
contraction in private sector debt cannot be rectified by the central bank lowering the cost of money. In
depressions, a) a large number of debtors have obligations to deliver more money than they have to meet their
obligations, and b) monetary policy is ineffective in reducing debt service costs and stimulating credit growth.
Typically, monetary policy is ineffective in stimulating credit growth either because interest rates can’t be
lowered (because interest rates are near 0%) to the point of favorably influencing the economics of spending and
capital formation (this produces deflationary deleveragings), or because money growth goes into the purchase of
inflation-hedge assets rather than into credit growth, which produces inflationary deleveragings. Depressions are
typically ended by central banks printing money to monetize debt in amounts that offset the deflationary
depression effects of debt reductions and austerity.
To be clear, while depressions are the contraction phase of a deleveraging, deleveragings (e.g., reducing debt
burdens) can occur without depressions if they are well managed. (See ”An In-Depth Look at Deleveragings.“)
Differences in how governments behave in recessions and deleveragings are good clues that signal which one is
happening. For example, in deleveragings, central banks typically ”print“ money that they use to buy large
quantities of financial assets in order to compensate for the decline in private sector credit, while these actions
are unheard of in recessions.4 Also, in deleveragings, central governments typically spend much, much more to
make up for the fall in private sector spending.
But let‘s not get ahead of ourselves. Since these two types of contractions are just parts of two different types of
cycles that are explained more completely in this Template, let’s look at the Template.

The Template: The Three Big Forces
I believe that three main forces drive most economic activity: 1) trend line productivity growth, 2) the long-term
debt cycle and 3) the short-term debt cycle. Figuratively speaking, they look as shown below:

1.

3.

What follows is an explanation of all three of these forces and how, by overlaying the archetypical short-term
debt cycle on top of the archetypical long-term debt cycle and overlaying them both on top of the productivity
trend line, one can derive a good template for tracking most economic/market movements. While these three
forces apply to all countries’ economies, in this study we will look at the U.S. economy over the last 100 years or
so as an example to convey the Template. This Template will tell you just about everything I have to say in a
nutshell. If you are interested to explore these concepts in more depth you can go into the next two chapters of
this book.

1) Productivity Growth
As shown below in chart 1, real per capita GDP has increased at an average rate of a shade less than 2% over the
last 100 years and didn’t vary a lot from that. This is because, over time, knowledge increases, which in turn
raises productivity and living standards. As shown in this chart, over the very long run, there is relatively little
variation from the trend line. Even the Great Depression in the 1930s looks rather small. As a result, we can be
relatively confident that, with time, the economy will get back on track. However, up close, these variations from
trend can be enormous. For example, typically in depressions the peak-to-trough declines in real economic
activity are around 20%, the destruction of financial wealth is typically more than 50% and equity prices typically
decline by around 80%. The losses in financial wealth for those who have it at the beginning of depressions are
typically greater than these numbers suggest because there is also a tremendous shifting of who has wealth.

Swings around this trend are not primarily due to expansions and contractions in knowledge. For example, the
Great Depression didn't occur because people forgot how to efficiently produce, and it wasn't set off by war or
drought. All the elements that make the economy buzz were there, yet it stagnated. So why didn't the idle
factories simply hire the unemployed to utilize the abundant resources in order to produce prosperity? These
cycles are not due to events beyond our control, e.g., natural disasters. They are due to human nature and the
way the credit system works.
Most importantly, major swings around the trend are due to expansions and contractions in credit – i.e., credit
cycles, most importantly 1) a long-term (typically 50 to 75 years) debt cycle and 2) a shorter-term (typically 5 to
8 years) debt cycle (i.e., the “business/market cycle”). Productivity is examined in greater depth in chapter III,
“Productivity and Structural Reform: Why Countries Succeed & Fail, and What Should Be Done So Failing
Countries Succeed.”

The Two Debt Cycles
I find that whenever I start talking about cycles, particularly the long-term variety, I raise eyebrows and elicit
reactions similar to those I’d expect if I were talking about astrology. For this reason, before I begin explaining
these two debt cycles I'd like to say a few things about cycles in general.
A cycle is nothing more than a logical sequence of events leading to a repetitious pattern. In a market-based
economy, cycles of expansions in credit and contractions in credit drive economic cycles and they occur for
perfectly logical reasons. Each sequence is not pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same way nor to take exactly
the same amount of time, though the patterns are similar, for logical reasons. For example, if you understand the
game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand credit and economic cycles. Early in the game of
Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels. Those who have
more hotels make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible into property in
order to profit from making other players give them cash. So as the game progresses, more hotels are acquired,
which creates more need for cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with lots of hotels on it)
at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels. When they are caught needing cash, they
are forced to sell their hotels at discounted prices. So early in the game, “property is king” and later in the game,
“cash is king.” Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold the right mix of property and
cash, as this right mix changes.
Now, let’s imagine how this Monopoly® game would work if we changed the role of the bank so that it could
make loans and take deposits. Players would then be able to borrow money to buy hotels and, rather than
holding their cash idly, they would deposit it at the bank to earn interest, which would provide the bank with more
money to lend. Let’s also imagine that players in this game could buy and sell properties from each other giving
each other credit (i.e., promises to give money and at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it would
provide an almost perfect model for the way our economy operates. There would be more spending on hotels
(that would be financed with promises to deliver money at a later date). The amount owed would quickly grow to
multiples of the amount of money in existence, hotel prices would be higher, and the cash shortage for the
debtors who hold hotels would become greater down the road. So, the cycles would become more pronounced.
The bank and those who saved by depositing their money in it would also get into trouble when the inability to
come up with needed cash caused withdrawals from the bank at the same time as debtors couldn’t come up with
cash to pay the bank. Basically, economic and credit cycles work this way.
We are now going to look at how credit cycles – both long-term debt cycles and short-term debt cycles – drive
economic cycles. But first we need to understand some basics of how money and credit work in a market-based
system.

Money and Credit in a Market-Based System
Prosperity exists when the economy is operating at a high level of capacity: in other words, when demand is
pressing up against a pre-existing level of capacity. At such times, business profits are good and unemployment
is low. The longer these conditions persist, the more capacity will be increased, typically financed by credit
growth. Declining demand creates a condition of low capacity utilization; as a result, business profits are bad and
unemployment is high. The longer these conditions exist, the more cost-cutting (i.e., restructuring) will occur,
typically including debt and equity write-downs. Therefore, prosperity equals high demand, and in our creditbased economy, strong demand equals strong real credit growth; conversely, deleveraging equals low demand,
and hence lower and falling real credit growth. Contrary to now-popular thinking, recessions and depressions do
not develop because of productivity (i.e., inabilities to produce efficiently); they develop from declines in demand,
typically due to a fall-off in credit creation.

Since changes in demand precede changes in capacity in determining the direction of the economy, one would
think that prosperity would be easy to achieve simply through pursuing policies that would steadily increase
demand. When the economy is plagued by low capacity utilization, depressed business profitability and high
unemployment, why doesn't the government simply give it a good shot of whatever it takes to stimulate demand
in order to produce a far more pleasant environment of high capacity utilization, fat profits and low
unemployment? The answer has to do with what that shot consists of.

Money
Money is what you settle your payments with. Some people mistakenly believe that money is whatever will buy
you goods and services, whether that's dollar bills or simply a promise to pay (e.g., whether it's a credit card or an
account at the local grocery). When a department store gives you merchandise in return for your signature on a
credit card form, is that signature money? No, because you did not settle the transaction. Rather, you promised
to pay money. So you created credit, which is a promise to pay money.
The Federal Reserve has chosen to define “money” in terms of aggregates (i.e., currency plus various forms of
credit - M1, M2, etc.), but this is misleading. Virtually all of what they call money is credit (i.e., promises to
deliver money) rather than money itself. The total amount of debt in the U.S. is about $50 trillion and the total
amount of money (i.e., currency and reserves) in existence is about $3 trillion. So, if we were to use these
numbers as a guide, the amount of promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) is roughly 15 times the amount of
money there is to deliver.5 The main point is that most people buy things with credit and don’t pay much
attention to what they are promising to deliver and where they are going to get it from, so there is much less
money than obligations to deliver it.

Credit
As mentioned, credit is the promise to deliver money, and credit spends just like money. While credit and money
spend just as easily, when you pay with money the transaction is settled; but if you pay with credit, the payment
has yet to be made.
There are two ways demand can increase: with credit or without it. Of course, it's far easier to stimulate demand
with credit than without it. For example, in an economy in which there is no credit, if I want to buy a good or
service I would have to exchange it for a comparably valued good or service of my own. Therefore, the only way I
can increase what I own and the economy as a whole can grow is through increased production. As a result, in an
economy without credit, the growth in demand is constrained by the growth in production. This tends to reduce
the occurrence of boom-bust cycles, but it also reduces both the efficiency that leads to high prosperity and
severe deleveraging, i.e., it tends to produce lower swings around the productivity growth trend line of about 2%.
By contrast, in an economy in which credit is readily available, I can acquire goods and services without giving up
any of my own. A bank will lend the money on my pledge to repay, secured by my existing assets and future
earnings. For these reasons credit and spending can grow faster than money and income. Since that sounds
counterintuitive, let me give an example of how that can work.
If I ask you to paint my office with an agreement that I will give you the money in a few months, your painting my
office will add to your income (because you were paid with credit), so it will add to GDP, and it will add to your
net worth (because my promise to pay is considered as much of an asset as the cash that I still owe you). Our
transaction will also add an asset (i.e., the capital improvement in my office) and a liability (the debt I still owe
you) to my balance sheet. Now let’s say that buoyed by this increased amount of business that I gave you and
your improved financial condition that you want to expand. So you go to your banker who sees your increased
income and net worth, so he is delighted to lend you some “money” (increasing his sales and his balance sheet)

that you decide to buy a financial asset with (let’s say stocks) until you want to spend it. As you can see, debt,
spending and investment would have increased relative to money and income.
This process can be, and generally is, self-reinforcing because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising
net worths, which raise borrowers’ capacity to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. Typically,
monetary expansions are used to support credit expansions because more money in the system makes it easier
for debtors to pay off their loans (with money of less value), and it makes the assets I acquired worth more
because there is more money around to bid them. As a result, monetary expansions improve credit ratings and
increase collateral values, making it that much easier to borrow and buy more.
In such an economy, demand is constrained only by the willingness of creditors and debtors to extend and receive
credit. When credit is easy and cheap, borrowing and spending will occur; and when it is scarce and expensive,
borrowing and spending will be less. In the short-term debt cycle, the central bank will control the supply of
money and influence the amount of credit that the private sector creates by influencing the cost of credit (i.e.,
interest rates). Changes in private sector credit drive the cycle. Over the long term, typically decades, debt
burdens rise. This obviously cannot continue forever. When it can’t continue a deleveraging occurs.
As previously mentioned, the most fundamental requirement for private sector credit creation to occur in a
market-based system is that both borrowers and lenders believe that the deal is good for them. Since one man’s
debts are another man’s assets, lenders have to believe that they will get paid back an amount of money that is
greater than inflation (i.e., more than they could get by storing their wealth in inflation-hedge assets), net of
taxes. And, because debtors have to pledge their assets (i.e., equity) as collateral in order to motivate the lenders,
they have to be at least as confident in their ability to pay their debts as they value the assets (i.e., equity) that
they pledged as collateral.
Also, an important consideration of investors is liquidity – i.e., the ability to sell their investments for money and
use that money to buy goods and services. For example, if I own a $100,000 Treasury bond, I probably presume
that I'll be able to exchange it for $100,000 in cash and in turn exchange the cash for $100,000 worth of goods
and services. However, since the ratio of financial assets to money is so high, obviously if a large number of
people tried to convert their financial assets into money and buy goods and services at the same time, the central
bank would have to either produce a lot more money (risking a monetary inflation) and/or allow a lot of defaults
(causing a deflationary deleveraging).

Monetary Systems
One of the greatest powers governments have is the creation of money and credit, which they exert by
determining their countries’ monetary systems and by controlling the levers that increase and decrease the
supply of money and credit. The monetary systems chosen have varied over time and between countries. In the
old days there was barter, i.e., the exchange of items of equal intrinsic value. That was the basis of money. When
you paid with gold coins, the exchange was for items of equal intrinsic value. Then credit developed – i.e.,
promises to deliver “money” of intrinsic value. Then there were promises to deliver money that didn’t have
intrinsic value.
Those who lend expect that they will get back an amount of money that can be converted into goods or services
of a somewhat greater purchasing power than the money they originally lent – i.e., they use credit to exchange
goods and services today for comparably valuable goods and services in the future. Since credit began, creditors
essentially asked those who controlled the monetary systems: “How do we know you won’t just print a lot of
money that won’t buy me much when I go to exchange it for goods and services in the future?” At different times,
this question was answered differently.
Basically, there are two types of monetary systems: 1) commodity-based systems – those systems consisting of
some commodity (usually gold), currency (which can be converted into the commodity at a fixed price) and
credit (a claim on the currency); and 2) fiat systems – those systems consisting of just currency and credit. In the

© 2015 Ray Dalio

first system, it's more difficult to create credit expansions. That is because the public will offset the government's
attempts to increase currency and credit by giving both back to the government in return for the commodity they
are exchangeable for. As the supply of money increases, its value falls; or looked at the other way, the value of
the commodity it is convertible into rises. When it rises above the fixed price, it is profitable for those holding
credit (i.e., claims on the currency) to sell their debt for currency in order to buy the tangible asset from the
government at below the market price. The selling of the credit and the taking of currency out of circulation
cause credit to tighten and the value of the money to rise; on the other hand, the general price level of goods and
services will fall. Its effect will be lower inflation and lower economic activity.
Since the value of money has fallen over time relative to the value of just about everything else, we could tie the
currency to just about anything in order to show how this monetary system would have worked.
For example, since a one-pound loaf of white bread in 1946 cost 10 cents, let's imagine we tied the dollar to
bread. In other words, let’s imagine a monetary system in which the government in 1946 committed to buy bread
at 10 cents a pound and stuck to that until now. Today a pound loaf of white bread costs $2.75. Of course, if they
had used this monetary system, the price couldn’t have risen to $2.75 because we all would have bought our
bread from the government at 10 cents instead of from the free market until the government ran out of bread.
But, for our example, let’s say that the price of bread is $2.75. I'd certainly be willing to take all of my money, buy
bread from the government at 10 cents and sell it in the market at $2.75, and others would do the same. This
process would reduce the amount of money in circulation, which would then reduce the prices of all goods and
services, and it would increase the amount of bread in circulation (thus lowering its price more rapidly than other
prices). In fact, if the supply and demand for bread were not greatly influenced by its convertibility to currency,
this tie would have dramatically slowed the last 50 years’ rapid growth in currency and credit.
Obviously, what the currency is convertible into has an enormous impact on this process. For example, if instead
of tying the dollar to bread, we chose to tie it to eggs, since the price of a dozen eggs in 1947 was 70 cents and
today it is about $2.00, currency and credit growth would have been less restricted.
Ideally, if one has a commodity-based currency system, one wants to tie the currency to something that is not
subject to great swings in supply or demand. For example, if the currency were tied to bread, bakeries would in
effect have the power to produce money, leading to increased inflation. Gold and, to a much lesser extent, silver,
have historically proven more stable than most other currency backings, although they are by no means perfect.
In the second type of monetary system – i.e., in a fiat system in which the amount of money is not constrained by
the ability to exchange it for a commodity – the growth of money and credit is very much subject to the influence
of the central bank and the willingness of borrowers and lenders to create credit.
Governments typically prefer fiat systems because they offer more power to print money, expand credit and
redistribute wealth by changing the value of money. Human nature being what it is, those in government (and
those not) tend to value immediate gratification over longer-term benefits, so government policies tend to
increase demand by allowing liberal credit creation, which leads to debt crises. Governments typically choose
commodity-based systems only when they are forced to in reaction to the value of money having been severely
depreciated due to the government’s “printing” of a lot of it to relieve the excessive debt burdens that their
unconstrained monetary systems allowed. They abandon commodity-based monetary systems when the
constraints to money creation become too onerous in debt crises. So throughout history, governments have gone
back and forth between commodity-based and fiat monetary systems in reaction to the painful consequences of
each. However, they don’t make these changes often, as monetary systems typically work well for many years,
often decades, with central banks varying interest rates and money supplies to control credit growth well enough
so that these inflection points are infrequently reached. In the next two sections I first describe the long-term
debt cycle and then the short-term debt cycle.

2) The Long-Term Debt Cycle
As previously mentioned, when debts and spending rise faster than money and income, the process is selfreinforcing on the upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise
borrowers’ capacity to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can’t rise
faster than money and income forever there are limits to debt growth. Think of debt growth that is faster than
income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle – there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra
boost, but you can’t live on it forever. In the case of debt, you can take it out before you put it in (i.e., if you don’t
have any debt, you can take it out), but you are expected to return what you took out. When you are taking it out,
you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the appearance of being prosperous. At such times,
you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as being creditworthy and not pay enough attention to
what your paying back will look like. When debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time of
paying back comes, the process works in reverse. It is that dynamic that creates long-term debt cycles. These
long-term debt cycles have existed for as long as there has been credit. Even the Old Testament described the
need to wipe out debt once every 50 years, which was called the year of Jubilee.
The next chart shows U.S. debt/GDP going back to 1916 and conveys the long-term debt cycle.

Upswings in the cycle occur, and are self-reinforcing, in a process by which money growth creates greater debt
growth, which finances spending growth and asset purchases. Spending growth and higher asset prices allow
even more debt growth. This is because lenders determine how much they can lend on the basis of the
borrowers’ 1) income/cash flows to service the debt and 2) net worth/collateral, as well as their own capacities
to lend, and these rise in a self-reinforcing manner.
Suppose you earn $100,000, have a net worth of $100,000 and have no debt. You have the capacity to borrow
$10,000/year, so you could spend $110,000 per year for a number of years, even though you only earn
$100,000. For an economy as a whole, this increased spending leads to higher earnings, which supports stock
valuations and other asset values, giving people higher incomes and more collateral to borrow more against, and
so on. In the up-wave part of the cycle, promises to deliver money (i.e., debt burdens) rise relative to both a) the
supply of money and b) the amount of money and credit debtors have coming in (via incomes, borrowings and
sales of assets). This up-wave in the cycle typically goes on for decades, with variations in it primarily due to
central banks tightening and easing credit (which makes short-term debt cycles). But it can’t go on forever.

Eventually the debt service payments become equal to or larger than the amount we can borrow and the
spending must decline. When promises to deliver money (debt) can’t rise any more relative to the money and
credit coming in, the process works in reverse and we have deleveragings. Since borrowing is simply a way of
pulling spending forward, the person spending $110,000 per year and earning $100,000 per year has to cut his
spending to $90,000 for as many years as he spent $110,000, all else being equal.
While the last chart showed the amount of debt relative to GDP, the debt ratio, it is more precise to say that high
debt service payments (i.e., principal and interest combined), rather than high debt levels, cause debt squeezes
because cash flows rather than levels of debt create the squeezes that slow the economy. For example, if interest
rates fall enough, debts can increase without debt service payments rising enough to cause a squeeze. This
dynamic is best conveyed in the chart below. It shows interest payments, principal payments and total debt
service payments of American households as a percentage of their disposable incomes going back to 1920. I am
showing this debt service burden for the household sector because the household sector is the most important
part of the economy; however, the concept applies equally well to all sectors and all individuals. As shown, the
debt service burden of households has increased to the highest level since the Great Depression. What triggers
reversals?

The long-term debt cycle top occurs when 1) debt burdens are high and/or 2) monetary policy doesn’t
produce credit growth. From that point on, debt can’t rise relative to incomes, net worth and money supply.
That is when deleveraging – i.e., bringing down these debt ratios – begins. All deleveragings start because there is
a shortage of money relative to debtors’ needs for it. This leads to large numbers of businesses, households and
financial institutions defaulting on their debts and cutting costs, which leads to higher unemployment and other
problems. While these debt problems can occur for many reasons, most classically they occur because
investment assets are bought at high prices and with leverage6 – i.e., because debt levels are set on the basis of
overly optimistic assumptions about future cash flows. As a result of this, actual cash flows fall short of what’s
required for debtors to service their debts. Ironically, quite often in the early stages the cash flows fall short
because of tight monetary policies that are overdue attempts to curtail these bubble activities (buying overpriced
assets with excessive leverage), so that the tight money triggers them (e.g., in 1928/29 in much of the world, in
1989/91 in Japan and in 2006/07 in much of the world). Also, ironically, inflation in financial assets is more
dangerous than inflation in goods and services because this financial asset inflation appears like a good thing and
6

This time around, residential and commercial real estate, private equity, lower grade credits and, to a lesser extent, listed equities were the
assets that were bought at high prices and on lots of leverage. During both the U.S. Great Depression and the Japanese deleveraging, stocks
and real estate were also the assets of choice that were bought at high prices and on leverage.

isn’t prevented even though it is as dangerous as any other form of over-indebtedness. In fact, while debtfinanced financial booms that are accompanied by low inflation are typically precursors of busts, at the time they
typically appear to be investment-generated productivity booms (e.g., much of the world in the late 1920s, Japan
in the late 1980s and much of the world in the mid 2000s).
Typically, though not always, interest rates decline in reaction to the economic and market declines and central
banks easing, but they can’t decline enough because they hit 0%. As a result, the ability of central banks to
alleviate these debt burdens, to stimulate private credit growth and to cause asset prices to rise via lower interest
rates is lost. These conditions cause buyers of financial assets to doubt that the value of the money they will get
from owning this asset will be more than the value of the money they pay for it. Then monetary policy is
ineffective in rectifying the imbalance.
In deleveragings, rather than indebtedness increasing (i.e., debt and debt service rising relative to income and
money), it decreases. This can happen in one of four ways: 1) debt reduction, 2) austerity, 3) transferring wealth
from the haves to the have-nots and 4) debt monetization. Each one of these four paths reduces debt/income
ratios, but they have different effects on inflation and growth. Debt reduction (i.e., defaults and restructurings)
and austerity are both deflationary and depressing while debt monetization is inflationary and stimulative.
Transfers of wealth typically occur in many forms, but rarely in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the
deleveraging. The differences between how deleveragings play out depends on the amounts and paces of these
four measures.
Depressions are the contraction phase of the deleveraging process. Typically the “depression” phase of the
deleveraging process comes at the first part of the deleveraging process, when defaults and austerity (i.e., the
forces of deflation and depression) dominate. Initially, in the depression phase of the deleveraging process, the
money coming in to debtors via incomes and borrowings is not enough to meet debtors’ obligations; assets need
to be sold and spending needs to be cut in order to raise cash. This leads asset values to fall, which reduces the
value of collateral, and in turn reduces incomes. Because of both lower collateral values and lower incomes,
borrowers’ creditworthiness is reduced, so they justifiably get less credit, and so it continues in a self-reinforcing
manner. Since the creditworthiness of borrowers is judged by both a) the values of their assets/collaterals (i.e.,
their net worths) in relation to their debts and b) the sizes of their incomes relative to the size of their debt
service payments, and since both net worths and incomes fall faster than debts, borrowers become less
creditworthy and lenders become more reluctant to lend. In this phase of the cycle the contraction is selfreinforcing at the same time as debt/income and debt/net-worth ratios rise. That occurs for two reasons. First,
when debts cannot be serviced both debtors and creditors are hurt; since one man’s debts are another man’s
assets, debt problems reduce net worths and borrowing abilities, thus causing a self-reinforcing contraction cycle.
Second, when spending is curtailed incomes are also reduced, thus reducing the ability to spend, also causing a
self-reinforcing contraction.
You can see debt burdens rise at the same time as the economy is in a deflationary depression in both chart 2 and
chart 3. The vertical line on these charts is at 1929. As you can see in chart 2, the debt/GDP ratio shot up from
about 160% to about 250% from 1929 to 1933. The vertical line in chart 3 shows the same picture – i.e., debt
service levels rose relative to income levels because income levels fell. In the economic and credit downturn,
debt burdens increase at the same time as debts are being written down, so the debt liquidation process is
reinforced. Chart 4 shows the household sector’s debt relative to its net worth. As shown, this leverage ratio
shot up from already high levels, as it did during the Great Depression, due to declines in net worths arising from
falling housing and stock prices.

As mentioned earlier, in a credit-based economy, the ability to spend is an extension of the ability to borrow. For
lending/borrowing to occur, lenders have to believe that a) they will get paid back an amount of money that is
greater than inflation and b) they will be able to convert their debt into money. In deleveragings, lenders
justifiably worry that these things will not happen.
Unlike in recessions, when cutting interest rates and creating more money can rectify this imbalance, in
deleveragings monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit. In other words, in recessions (when monetary
policy is effective) the imbalance between the amount of money and the need for it to service debt can be
rectified by cutting interest rates enough to 1) ease debt service burdens, 2) stimulate economic activity because
monthly debt service payments are high relative to incomes and 3) produce a positive wealth effect. However, in
deleveragings, this can’t happen. In deflationary depressions/deleveragings, monetary policy is typically
ineffective in creating credit because interest rates hit 0% and can’t be lowered further, so other, less effective
ways of increasing money are followed. Credit growth is difficult to stimulate because borrowers remain overindebted, making sensible lending impossible. In inflationary deleveragings, monetary policy is ineffective in
creating credit because increased money growth goes into other currencies and inflation-hedge assets because
investors fear that their lending will be paid back with money of depreciated value.
In order to try to alleviate this fundamental imbalance, governments inevitably a) create initiatives to encourage
credit creation, b) ease the rules that require debtors to come up with money to service their debts (i.e., create
forbearance) and, most importantly, c) print and spend money to buy goods, services and financial assets. The
printing of and buying financial assets by central banks shows up in central banks’ balance sheets expanding and
the increased spending by central governments shows up in budget deficits exploding. This is shown in the
following three charts.

You can tell deleveragings by these three things occurring together, which does not happen at other times.
Typically, though not necessarily, these moves come in progressively larger dosages as initial dosages of these
sorts fail to rectify the imbalance and reverse the deleveraging process. However, these dosages do typically
cause temporary periods of relief that are manifest in bear market rallies in financial assets and increased
economic activity. For example, in the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market (of between
21% and 48%) in a bear market that totaled 89%, with all of these rallies triggered by these sorts of increasingly
strong dosages of government actions that were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance.
That is because a return to an environment of normal capital formation and normal economic activity can occur
only by eliminating this fundamental imbalance so that capable providers of capital (i.e., investors/lenders)
willingly choose to give money to capable recipients of capital (borrowers and sellers of equity) in exchange for
believable claims that they will get back an amount of money that is worth more than they gave. Eventually there
is enough “printing of money” or debt monetization to negate the deflationary forces of both debt reduction and
austerity. When a good balance of debt reduction, austerity, and “printing/monetizing” occurs, debt burdens
can fall relative to incomes with positive economic growth. In the U.S. deleveraging of the 1930s, this occurred
from 1933 to 1937.
Some people mistakenly think that the depression problem is just psychological: that scared investors move their
money from riskier investments to safer ones (e.g., from stocks and high-yield lending to government cash), and
that problems can be rectified by coaxing them to move their money back into riskier investments. This is wrong
for two reasons. First, contrary to popular thinking, the deleveraging dynamic is not primarily psychologically
driven. It is primarily driven by the supply and demand of and relationships between credit, money and goods
and services. If everyone went to sleep and woke up with no memories of what had happened, we would all soon
find ourselves in the same position. That is, because debtors still couldn’t service their debts, because their
obligations to deliver money would still be too large relative to the money they are taking in, the government
would still be faced with the same choices that would still have the same consequences, etc. Related to this, if
the central bank produces more money to alleviate the shortage, it will cheapen the value of money, thus not
rectifying creditors’ worries about being paid back an amount of money that is worth more than they gave.
Second, it is not correct that the amount of money in existence remains the same and has simply moved from
riskier assets to less risky ones. Most of what people think is money is really credit, and it does disappear. For
example, when you buy something in a store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, “I promise to pay.”
Together you created a credit asset and a credit liability. So where did you take the money from? Nowhere. You
created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store owner justifiably believes that you and others
might not pay the credit card company and that the credit card company might not pay him if that happens. Then
he correctly believes that the “asset” he has isn’t really there. It didn’t go somewhere else.
As implied by this, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought
was their wealth isn’t really there. When investors try to convert their investments into money in order to raise
needed cash, the liquidity of their investments is tested and, in cases in which the investments prove illiquid,
panic-induced “runs” and sell-offs of their securities occur. Naturally those who experience runs, especially
banks (though this is true of most entities that rely on short-term funding), have problems raising money and
credit to meet their needs, so they often fail. At such times, governments are forced to decide which ones to save
by providing them with money and whether to get this money through the central government (i.e., through the
budget process) or through the central bank “printing” more money. Governments inevitably do both, though in
varying degrees. What determines whether deleveragings are deflationary or inflationary is the extent to which
central banks create money to negate the effects of contracting credit.
Governments with commodity-based monetary systems or pegged currencies are more limited in their abilities to
“print” and provide money, while those with independent fiat monetary systems are less constrained. However,
in both cases, the central bank is eager to provide money and credit, so it always lowers the quality of the

collateral it accepts and, in addition to providing money to some essential banks, it also typically provides money
to some non-bank entities it considers essential.
The central bank’s easing of monetary policy and the movement of investor money to safer investments initially
drives down short-term government interest rates, steepens the yield curve and widens credit and liquidity
premiums. Those who do not receive money and/or credit that is needed to meet their debt service obligations
and maintain their operations, which is typically a large segment of debtors, default and fail.
In depressions, as credit collapses, workers lose jobs and many of them, having inadequate savings, need financial
support. So in addition to needing money to provide financial support to the system, governments need money to
help those in greatest financial need. Additionally, to the extent that they want to increase spending to make up
for decreased private sector spending, they need more money. At the same time, their tax revenue falls because
incomes fall. For these reasons, governments’ budget deficits increase. Inevitably, the amount of money lent to
governments at these times increases less than their needs (i.e., they have problems funding their deficits),
despite the increased desire of lenders to buy government securities to seek safety at these times. As a result,
central banks are again forced to choose between “printing” more money to buy their governments’ debts or
allowing their governments and their private sector to compete for the limited supply of money, thus allowing
extremely tight money conditions.
Governments with commodity-based money systems are forced to have smaller budget deficits and tighter
monetary policies than governments with fiat monetary systems, though they all eventually relent and print more
money (i.e., those on commodity-based monetary systems either abandon these systems or change the
amount/pricing of the commodity that they will exchange for a unit of money so that they print more, and those
on fiat systems will just print more). This “printing” of money takes the form of central bank purchases of
government securities and non-government assets such as corporate securities, equities and other assets. In
other words, the government “prints” money and uses it to negate some of the effects of contracting credit. This
is reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity
contract. Traditional economists see that as the velocity of money declining, but it’s nothing of the sort. If the
money creation is large enough, it devalues the currency, lowers real interest rates and drives investors from
financial assets to inflation-hedge assets. This typically happens when investors want to move money outside
the currency, and short-term government debt is no longer considered a safe investment.
Because governments need more money, and since wealth and incomes are typically heavily concentrated in the
hands of a small percentage of the population, governments raise taxes on the wealthy. Also, in deleveragings,
those who earned their money in the booms, especially the capitalists who made a lot of money working in the
financial sector helping to create the debt (and especially the short sellers who some believe profited at others’
expense), are resented. Tensions between the “haves” and the “have-nots” typically increase and, quite often,
there is a move from the right to the left. In fact, there is a saying that essentially says “in booms everyone is a
capitalist and in busts everyone is a socialist.” For these various reasons, taxes on the wealthy are typically
significantly raised. These increased taxes typically take the form of greater income and consumption taxes
because these forms of taxation are the most effective in raising revenues. While sometimes wealth and
inheritance taxes are also increased,7 these typically raise very little money because much wealth is illiquid and,
even for liquid assets, forcing the taxpayer to sell financial assets to make their tax payments undermines capital
formation. Despite these greater taxes on the wealthy, increases in tax revenue are inadequate because incomes
– both earned incomes and incomes from capital – are so depressed, and expenditures on consumption are
reduced.
The wealthy experience a tremendous loss of “real” wealth in all forms – i.e., from their portfolios declining in
value, from their earned incomes declining and from higher rates of taxation, in inflation-adjusted terms. As a
result, they become extremely defensive. Quite often, they are motivated to move their money out of the country

The extent to which wealth taxes can be applied varies by country. For example, they have been judged to be unconstitutional in the U.S. but
have been allowed in other countries.

(which contributes to currency weakness), illegally dodge taxes and seek safety in liquid, non-credit-dependent
investments.
Workers losing jobs and governments wanting to protect them become more protectionist and favor weaker
currency policies. Protectionism slows economic activity, and currency weakness fosters capital flight. Debtor
countries typically suffer most from capital flight.
When money leaves the country, central banks are once again put in the position of having to choose between
“printing” more money, which lessens its value, and not printing money in order to maintain its value but allowing
money to tighten. They inevitably choose to “print” more money. This is additionally bearish for the currency.
As mentioned, currency declines are typically acceptable to governments because a weaker currency is
stimulative for growth and helps to negate deflationary pressures. Additionally, when deflation is a problem,
currency devaluations are desirable because they help to negate it.
Debtor, current account deficit countries are especially vulnerable to capital withdrawals and currency weakness
as foreign investors also tend to flee due to both currency weakness and an environment inhospitable to good
returns on capital. However, this is less true for countries that have a great amount of debt denominated in their
own currencies (like the United States in the recent period and in the Great Depression) as these debts create a
demand for these currencies. Since debt is a promise to deliver money that one doesn’t have, this is essentially a
short squeeze that ends when a) the shorts are fully squeezed (i.e., the debts are defaulted on) and/or b) enough
money is created to alleviate the squeeze, and/or c) the debt service requirements are reduced in some other
way (e.g., forbearance).
The risk at this stage of the process is that the currency weakness and the increased supply of money will lead to
short-term credit (even government short-term credit) becoming undesirable, causing the buying of inflationhedge assets and capital flight rather than credit creation. For foreign investors, receiving an interest rate that is
near 0% and having the foreign currency that their deposits are denominated in decline produces a negative
return; so this set of circumstances makes holding credit, even government short-term credit, undesirable.
Similarly, for domestic investors, this set of circumstances makes foreign currency deposits more desirable. If
and when this happens, investors accelerate their selling of financial assets, especially debt assets, to get cash in
order to use this cash to buy other currencies or inflation-hedge assets such as gold. They also seek to borrow
cash in that local currency. Once again, that puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between
increasing the supply of money to accommodate this demand for it or allowing money and credit to tighten and
real interest rates to rise. At such times, sometimes governments seek to curtail this movement by establishing
foreign exchange controls and/or prohibiting gold ownership. Also, sometimes price and wage controls are put
into place. Such moves typically create economic distortions rather than alleviate problems.
Though the deleveraging process, especially the depression phase of it, seems horrible and certainly produces
great hardships – in some cases, even wars – it is the free market’s way of repairing itself. In other words, it gets
the capital markets and the economy into a much healthier condition by rectifying the fundamental imbalance.
Debts are reduced (through bankruptcies and other forms of debt restructuring), businesses’ break-even levels
are reduced through cost-cutting, the pricing of financial assets becomes cheap, and the supply of money to buy
the assets and to service debts is increased by the central banks – so capital formation becomes viable again.
Deleveragings typically end via a mix of 1) debt reduction, 2) austerity, 3) redistributions of wealth, and 4) debt
monetization. Additionally, through this process, businesses lowering their break-even levels through costcutting, substantial increases in risk and liquidity premiums that restore the economics of capital formation (i.e.,
lending and equity investing), and nominal interest rates being held under nominal growth rates typically occur.
The decline in economic and credit creation activity (the depression phase) is typically fast, lasting two to three
years. However, the subsequent recovery in economic activity and capital formation tends to be slow, so it takes

18

roughly a decade (hence the term “lost decade”) for real economic activity to reach its former peak level. Though
it takes about a decade to return the economy to its former peak levels, it typically takes longer for real stock
prices to reach former highs, because equity risk premiums take a very long time to reach pre-deleveraging lows.
During this time nominal interest rates must be kept below nominal growth rates to reduce the debt burdens. If
interest rates are at 0% and there is deflation, central banks must “print” enough money to raise nominal growth.
As mentioned, these cycles are due to human nature and the way the system works. Throughout this process,
most everyone behaves pretty much as you’d expect in pursuing their self-interest, thus reacting to and causing
developments in logical ways, given how the economic machine works.

3) The Short-Term Debt Cycle
The short-term debt cycle, also known as the business cycle, is primarily controlled by central banks’ policies that
a) tighten when inflation is too high and/or rising uncomfortably because there isn’t much slack in the economy
(as reflected in the GDP gap, capacity utilization and the unemployment rate) and credit growth is strong; and b)
ease when the reverse conditions exist. The cycles in the U.S. since 1960 are shown below.

These cycles can be described a bit differently by different people, but they are all about the same. They typically
occur in six phases – four in the expansion and two in the recession.
The expansion phase of the cycle:
The “early-cycle” (which typically lasts about five or six quarters), typically begins with the demand for
interest rate sensitive items (e.g., housing and cars) and retail sales picking up because of low interest rates
and lots of available credit. It is also supported by prior inventory liquidations stopping and inventory
rebuilding starting. This increased demand and rising production pulls the average workweek and then
employment up. Credit growth is typically fast, economic growth is strong (i.e., in excess of 4%), inflation is
low, growth in consumption is strong, the rate of inventory accumulation is increasing, the U.S. stock market
is typically the best investment (because there is fast growth and interest rates aren’t rising because inflation
isn’t rising) and inflation-hedge assets and commodities are the worst-performing assets.
This is typically followed by what I call the “mid-cycle” (which lasts an average of three or four quarters)
when economic growth slows substantially (i.e., to around 2%), inflation remains low, growth in
consumption slows, the rate of inventory accumulation declines, interest rates dip, the stock market rate of
increase tapers off, and the rate of decline in inflation-hedge assets slows.

© 2015 Ray Dalio

19

This in turn is followed by the “late-cycle“ (which typically begins about two and a half years into expansion,
depending on how much slack existed in the economy at the last recession’s trough). At this point, economic
growth picks up to a moderate pace (i.e., around 3.5-4%), capacity constraints emerge, but credit and
demand growth are still strong. So, inflation begins to trend higher, growth in consumption rises, inventories
typically pick up, interest rates rise, the stock market stages its last advance and inflation-hedge assets
become the best-performing investments.
This is typically followed by the tightening phase of the expansion. In this phase, actual or anticipated
acceleration of inflation prompts the Fed to turn restrictive, which shows up in reduced liquidity, interest
rates rising and the yield curve flattening or inverting. This, in turn, causes money supply and credit growth
to fall and the stock market to decline before the economy turns down.
The recession phase of the cycle follows and occurs in two parts.
In the early part of the recession, the economy contracts, slack returns (as measured by the GDP gap,
capacity utilization and the unemployment rate), stocks, commodities and inflation-hedge assets fall and
inflation declines because the Fed remains tight.
In the late part of the recession, the central bank eases monetary policy as inflation concerns subside and
recession concerns grow. So interest rates decline and the lower interest rates cause stock prices to rise
(even though the economy hasn’t yet turned up) while commodity prices and inflation-hedge assets continue
to be weak. The lower interest rates and higher stock prices set the stage for the expansion part of the cycle
to begin.
Although I have referred to average time lags between each of these stages of the cycle, as mentioned from the
outset, it is the sequence of events, not the specific timeline, which is important to keep an eye on. For example,
given the previously described linkages, inflation doesn't normally heat up until the slack in the economy is largely
eliminated, and the Fed doesn't normally turn restrictive until inflation rises. An expansion that starts off after a
deep recession (i.e., one that produces lots of slack) is bound to last longer than an expansion that begins with
less excess capacity. Similarly, as the cycle progresses through its various stages as a function of the sequences
just described, the rate at which it progresses will be a function of the forcefulness of the influences that drive its
progression. For example, an expansion that is accompanied by an aggressively stimulative central bank is likely
to be stronger and evolve more quickly than one that is accompanied by a less stimulative monetary policy. Also,
exogenous influences such as China’s entry into the world economy, wars and natural disasters can alter the
progressions of these cycles. What I am providing is a description of the classic template: not all cycles manifest
precisely as described.
For the sake of brevity, I won’t go into great depth about short-term debt cycles here.

The Interaction of These Three Forces
While the economy is more complicated than this Template suggests, laying the short-term debt cycle on top of
the long-term debt cycle and then laying them both on top of the productivity line gives a good conceptual
roadmap for understanding the market-based system and seeing both where the economy is now and where it is
probably headed. For the sake of brevity, I won’t digress into a complete explanation of this. But I will give an
example.
Example: The table below shows each of the cyclical peaks and troughs in the Fed funds rate, when they
occurred, the magnitudes of changes up and the magnitudes of the changes down (in both basis point terms and
percentage terms), since 1919. These are the interest rate changes that caused all of the recessions and
expansions over the last 90 years. This table shows 15 cyclical increases and 15 cyclical decreases. Note that
these swings were around one big uptrend and one big downtrend. Specifically, note that from the September
1932 low (at 0%) until the May 1981 high (at 19%), every cyclical low in interest rates was above the prior
cyclical low and every cyclical high was above the prior cyclical high – i.e., all of the cyclical increases and
decreases were around that 50-year uptrend. And note that from the May 1981 high in the Fed funds rate (at
19%), until the March 2009 low in the Fed funds rate (0%), every cyclical low in the Fed funds rate was lower
than the prior low and every cyclical high in interest rates was below the prior cyclical high – i.e., all of the cyclical
increases and all of the cyclical decreases were around a 27-year downtrend. Each cyclical decline in interest
rates incrementally reduced debt service payments, lowered the de-facto purchase prices of items bought on
credit to make them more affordable and boosted the value of assets a notch (having a positive wealth effect).
So, debt continued to rise relative to income and money, though the trend in debt service payments was
essentially flat, until interest rates hit 0% and this could not longer continue, at which time the government had
to print and spend a lot of money to make up for the reduced private sector credit creation and spending.

Again, for the sake of brevity, I won’t go into greater depth about the three forces' interactions here. As
mentioned at the outset, this chapter is meant to just to give you a brief explanation of how I believe the
economic machine works. For those who are inclined to learn more, the following chapters: “II. Debt Cycles:
Leveragings & Deleveragings” and “III. Productivity and Structural Reform: Why Countries Succeed & Fail, and
What Should Be Done So Failing Countries Succeed,” examine these processes in much greater depth. In chapter
II, “An In-Depth Look at Deleveragings” reviews the mechanics of deleveragings across a number of cases and
why some are beautiful and others ugly. The chapter concludes with detailed timelines of two classic deflationary
and inflationary deleveragings – the U.S. deleveraging of the 1930s and the Weimar Republic deleveraging of the
1920s – to make clear the important cause and effect relationships at work and to convey an up-close feeling of
what it was like to go through the experiences as an investor. Chapter III has two parts: “Part 1: The Formula for
Economic Success”, “Part 2: Economic Health Indices by Country, and the Prognoses that They Imply” and “Part
3: The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years”. The first discusses how different countries’
shares of the world economy have changed and why these changes occurred. The second examines in more
depth the drivers of long term growth, the logic behind them, and what they say about the economic health of
countries today.

An In-Depth Look at Deleveragings
The purpose of this paper is to show the compositions of past deleveragings and, through this process, to convey
in-depth, how the deleveraging process works.
The deleveraging process reduces debt/income ratios. When debt burdens become too large, deleveragings
must happen. These deleveragings can be well managed or badly managed. Some have been very ugly (causing
great economic pain, social upheaval and sometimes wars, while failing to bring down the debt/income ratio),
while others have been quite beautiful (causing orderly adjustments to healthy production-consumption
balances in debt/income ratios). In this study, I review the mechanics of deleveragings by showing how a
number of past deleveragings transpired in order to convey that some are ugly and some are beautiful. What
you will see is that beautiful deleveragings are well balanced and ugly ones are badly imbalanced. The
differences between how deleveragings are resolved depend on the amounts and paces of 1) debt reduction, 2)
austerity, 3) transferring wealth from the haves to the have-nots and 4) debt monetization. What I am saying is
that beautiful ones balance these well and ugly ones don’t and what I will show below is how.
Before I examine these, I will review the typical deleveraging process.

The Typical Deleveraging Process
Typically, deleveragings are badly managed because they come along about once in every lifetime and policy
makers haven't studied them. As a result, they usually set policies like blind men trying to cook on a hot stove,
through a painful trial and error process in which the pain of their mistakes drives them away from the bad
moves toward the right moves. Since everyone eventually gets through the deleveraging process, the only
question is how much pain they endure in the process. Because there have been many deleveragings throughout
history to learn from, and because the economic machine is a relatively simple thing, a lot of pain can be avoided
if they understand how this process works and how it has played out in past times. That is the purpose of this
study.
As previously explained, the differences between deleveragings depend on the amounts and paces of 1) debt
reduction, 2) austerity, 3) transferring wealth from the haves to the have-nots, and 4) debt monetization. Each
one of these four paths reduces debt/income ratios, but they have different effects on inflation and growth. Debt
reduction (i.e., defaults and restructurings) and austerity are both deflationary and depressing while debt
monetization is inflationary and stimulative. Ugly deleveragings get these out of balance while beautiful ones
properly balance them. In other words, the key is in getting the mix right.
Typically, in response to a debt crisis the going to these four steps takes place in the following order:
1)

At first, problems servicing debt and the associated fall off in debt growth cause an economic
contraction in which the debt/income ratios rise at the same time as economic activity and
financial asset prices fall. I will call this phase an “ugly deflationary deleveraging”. Debt
reduction (i.e., defaults and restructurings) and austerity without material debt monetization
characterize this phase. During this period, the fall in private sector credit growth and the tightness
of liquidity lead to declines in demand for goods, services and financial assets. The financial bubble
bursts when there is not enough money to service the debt and debt defaults and restructurings hit
people, especially leveraged lenders (banks), like an avalanche that causes fears. These justified
fears feed on themselves and lead to a liquidity crisis. As a result, policy makers find themselves in a
mad scramble to contain the defaults before they spin out of control. This path to reducing debt
burdens (i.e., debt defaults and restructurings) must be limited because it would otherwise lead to a

25

self-reinforcing downward spiral in which defaults and restructurings can be so damaging to
confidence that, if let go, they might prevent faith and recoveries from germinating for years.
Defaults and restructurings cannot be too large or too fast because one man's debts are another
man's assets, so the wealth effect of cutting the value of these assets aggressively can be devastating
on the demands for goods, services and investment assets. Since in order to reduce debt service
payments to sustainable levels the amount of write-down must equal what is required so the debtor
will be able to pay (e.g., let's say it’s 30% less), a write-down will reduce the creditor's asset value by
that amount (e.g. 30%). While 30% sounds like a lot, since many entities are leveraged, the impacts
on their net worths can be much greater. For example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would
experience a 60% decline in his net worth. Since banks are typically leveraged about 12 or 15:1, that
picture is obviously devastating for them. This is usually apparent from the outset of the
deleveragings. Since the devastating forcefulness of the wave of defaults that occurs in a
deleveraging is apparent from the outset, policy makers are typically immediately motivated to
contain the rate of defaults, though they typically don't know the best ways to do that.
In reaction to the shock of the debt crisis, policy makers typically try austerity because that's the
obvious thing to do. Since it is difficult for the debtor to borrow more, and since it’s clear that he
already has too much debt, it’s obvious that he has to cut his spending to bring it back in line with his
income. The problem is that one man's spending is another man's income, so when spending is cut,
incomes are also cut, so it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions
to debt/income ratios. Normally policy makers play around with this path for a couple of years, get
burned by the results, and eventually realize that more must be done because the deflationary and
depressing effects of both debt reduction and austerity are too painful. That leads them to go to the
next phase in which “printing money” plays a bigger role. I don’t mean to convey that debt reductions
and austerity don’t play beneficial roles in the deleveraging process because they do – just not big
enough roles to make much of a difference and with too painful results unless balanced with “printing
money/monetization”.
2) In the second phase of the typical deleveraging the debt/income ratios decline at the same
time as economic activity and financial asset prices improve. This happens because there is
enough “printing of money/debt monetization” to bring the nominal growth rate above the
nominal interest rate and a currency devaluation to offset the deflationary forces. This creates
a “beautiful deleveraging”. The best way of negating the deflationary depression is for the central
bank to provide adequate liquidity and credit support and, depending on different key entities’ need
for capital, for the central government to provide that too. This takes the form of the central bank
both lending against a wider range of collateral (both lower quality and longer maturity) and buying
(monetizing) lower-quality and/or longer-term debt. This produces relief and, if done in the right
amounts, allows a deleveraging to occur with positive growth. The right amounts are those that a)
neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit market collapse and b) get the nominal
growth rate marginally above the nominal interest rate to tolerably spread out the deleveraging
process. At such times of reflation, there is typically currency weakness, especially against gold, but
this will not produce unacceptably high inflation because the reflation is simply negating the
deflation. History has shown that those who have done it quickly and well (like the US in 2008/9)
have derived much better results than those who did it late (like the US in 1930-33). However, there
is such a thing as abusive use of stimulants. Because stimulants work so well relative to the
alternatives, there is a real risk that they can be abused, causing an “ugly inflationary deleveraging”.
3) When there is too much “printing of money/monetization” and too severe a currency
devaluation (which are reflationary) relative to the amounts of the other three alternatives
“ugly inflationary deleveragings” can occur. When these happen a) they either occur quickly in
countries that don’t have reserve currencies, that have significant foreign currency denominated
debts and in which the inflation rate is measured in their rapidly depreciating local currency, and b)

they can occur slowly and late in the deleveraging process of reserve currency countries, after a long
time and a lot of stimulation that is used to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
By the way, transfers of wealth from the have to the have-nots typically occur in many forms (e.g.,
increased taxes on the wealthy, financial support programs such as those the "rich” European countries
are providing to the overly indebted ones, etc.) throughout the process, but they rarely occur in amounts
that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging (unless there are "revolutions").
Now let's take a look at some past deleveragings so we can see these things happening.

Past Deleveragings
While there are dozens of deleveragings that I could have picked, I chose seven – 1) the US in the 1930s, 2) Japan
in the 1930s, 3) the UK in the '50s and '60s, 4) Japan over the past two decades, 5) the US 2008-now, 6) Spain
now and 7) the Weimar Republic in the 1920s – because they are both important and different in interesting
ways. As you will see, while they are different because the amounts and paces of the four paths to deleveraging
were different, “the economic machines” that drove the outcomes were basically the same.
I am going to begin by looking at the first six and then turn our attention to the Weimar Republic’s inflationary
deleveraging.
I will break these down into three groups, which I will call:
1)

“ugly deflationary deleveragings” (which occurred before enough money was “printed” and
deflationary contractions existed and when nominal interest rates were above nominal growth rates),

2) “beautiful deleveragings” (those in which enough “printing” occurred to balance the deflationary
forces of debt reduction and austerity in a manner in which there is positive growth, a falling
debt/income ratio and nominal GDP growth above nominal interest rates), and
3) “ugly inflationary deleveragings” (in which the “printing” is large relative to the deflationary forces
and nominal growth through monetary inflation and interest rates are in a self-reinforcing upward
spiral).

The Ugly Deflationary Deleveragings (i.e., when the economy was bad
while the debt/income ratio rose)
As shown below, in all of these cases, a) money printing was limited, b) nominal growth was below nominal
rates, c) the currency was generally strong, and d) the debt/income ratios rose because of the combination of
interest payment costs and nominal incomes falling or stagnating.

The following charts attribute the changes in debt/GDP. More specifically, a black dot conveys the total
annualized change in debt/GDP. Each bar breaks up the attribution of this change into the following pieces:
changes in GDP (i.e., income) and changes in the nominal value of the debt stock. Income changes are broken
into (1) real income changes and (2) inflation. A decline in real GDP shows up as a positive contribution to
debt/GDP in the shaded region, while an increase in inflation shows up as a negative contribution. Changes in
nominal debt levels are broken into (3) defaults, (4) the amount of new borrowing required just to make interest
payments, and (5) whatever increases or decreases in borrowing that occur beyond that. So, defaults show up as
negatives, while interest payments show up as positives and new borrowing beyond interest payments as
positives or negatives (depending on whether new debt was created or paid down).

The Beautiful Deleveragings (i.e., when the economy was growing in a
balanced way with the debt/income ratio declining)
As shown below, in all of these cases, money printing and currency devaluations were sizable, nominal growth
rates were pushed above nominal interest rates and the debt/income ratios fell. During the reflation periods, a
recovery in nominal incomes lessened the debt/income burdens. Naturally, in cases in which the downturns that
preceded these periods were very deep (e.g., 1930-32 in the US) the rebounds were greater.

Notes:
- In the US nominal growth has outpaced nominal government bond yields, but has been a bit below aggregate interest rates paid in the economy
(given the credit spread component of private sector debt and that the fall in bond yields today flows through with a lag to the rate borne in the
economy). As a result, the increase in debt/GDP from interest payments has been a bit higher than the reduction from nominal incomes (real +
inflation), but the trajectory is for aggregate economy-wide interest rates to fall below nominal growth.
- For the Japan in the 1930s case, we do not have reliable default data, so “New Borrowing above Int. Payments” is net of defaults in that case.

The Ugly Inflationary Deleveraging (i.e., when the economy was bad at
the same time as there was hyperinflation that wiped out the debts)
While you can get the rough big picture of the dynamic from the numbers below, which summarize the
hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic, the explanation that will follow later will make this picture clearer. This
dynamic is basically the same as those in other inflationary deleveragings such as those in Latin America in the
1980s.

Total Change in Debt

A Closer Look at Each
United States Depression and Reflation, 1930-1937
As explained, the US Great Deleveraging in the 1930s transpired in two phases – a deflationary depression from
1930 through 1932, and a reflationary deleveraging from 1933 to 1937. The charts below show debt levels
against nominal GDP growth year over year (left chart) and against the total return of stocks (right chart). Debt
levels as % of GDP are on the right axis of each chart. The line shows where there was a significant amount of
“money printing”. The first phase is labeled (1) and the second phase is labeled (2). During the first phase (the
“ugly deflationary depression” phase), income and credit collapsed, with nominal growth rates falling
significantly below nominal interest rates, and the economy contracted while the debt/income ratio rose. As
shown, it followed the stock market bubble bursting in September 1929. As a result of that private sector
deleveraging, incomes collapsed, to the point that they were declining by nearly 30% per year at the end of 1932.
Because of the fall in incomes, debt/GDP rose from roughly 150% to 250% of GDP (as shown on the left).
Through this time stocks fell by more than 80% (as shown on the right). This first phase ended and the second
phase began when the money printing started in March 1933. FDR broke the peg to gold and the dollar fell 40%
from 21 dollars/ounce to 35 over the course of the year. This reflation also led to rising economic activity, and
nominal growth to be above nominal interest rates. 1937 is when it ended in response to the Fed turning
restrictive which caused a “re”cession (which is when the term was invented).

In March of '33, the Fed eased by devaluing the dollar against gold and kept interest rates low for many years.
Most of the additional balance sheet expansion was to buy gold to keep the value of the dollar depressed. While
the Fed made money easy through low rates and currency, it did not directly buy many risky assets (unlike today
as I discuss further below).

The table below tells this story more precisely. During the “ugly deflationary depression”, incomes collapsed as
nominal GDP fell 17% per year, about half from deflation and half from the collapse in real demand. As a result,
nominal growth was 20.4% below nominal rates, and debt to GDP rose at a rate of 32% per year. Beginning
March 1933, the government devalued the dollar against gold and from ’33-‘37 it increased money supply
roughly 1.7% of GDP. Nominal growth recovered at a rate of 9.2% in this period, a combination of 7.2% real
growth and moderate 2% inflation. Nominal GDP rose to 6.3% above rates. The private sector reduced its debt
burdens, while government borrowing grew with incomes.

The chart below shows an over time picture of the same basic attribution shown earlier. Relative to GDP, total
debt was the same in 1937 as in 1930. In between, it ballooned because of a contraction in incomes from
deflation and negative real growth. The reversal of the debt burden was driven by a rise in incomes to 1930
levels in nominal terms. Borrowing for interest payments was mostly offset by paying down of debts.

The stock of government debt was small at the onset of the depression. Initially, this debt burden rose because
of the collapse in income. Nominal government debt levels increased following 1933 because of larger fiscal
deficits, while the income recovery cushioned the increase in these burdens.

As shown below, the catalyst for the recovery was the printing and dollar devaluation against gold. Price levels
turned at this point, from declining at an average rate of 8% to increasing roughly 2% per year. This is a good
example of how printing negated deflation rather than triggering high inflation.

Japan Depression and Reflation, 1929-1936
The Japanese deleveraging during the Great Depression was similar to the experience of the US, though Japan
printed money earlier than the US did. The ugly deflationary phase, labeled (1), began three months after the
Wall Street Crash of 1929 when Japan returned to the gold standard at a high pre-WWI level. That arose
because the political party gaining power believed the debt excesses of the past required fiscal and monetary
restraint to fix the debt problems. The expensive currency and the deteriorating global economy caused a
collapse in real growth, severe deflation, a decline in exports, a crash in stock prices, and a tightening of liquidity
as Japan’s gold reserves fell. Collapsing incomes resulted in debt increasing from nearly 75% of GDP in 1929 to
nearly 110% of GDP by the end of 1931. Then, in response to this pain, a new government came into power in late
1931 and broke the link to gold as one of its first moves. Over the course of a year, the yen devalued about 60%
against the dollar and gold. At the same time, the government increased expenditures by about 3% of GDP, and
the Bank of Japan kept rates low and monetized a modest amount of government debt. This stimulus supported a
recovery in exports, price levels and incomes over the period from 1932-1936, labeled (2) in the charts below.
The charts below show debt levels against nominal GDP growth year over year (left chart) and against the total
return of stocks (right chart). Debt levels as % of GDP are on the right axis of each chart. The line shows where
the government delinked the currency from gold. The devaluation and low short rates brought nominal growth
above nominal interest, which led the total debt to fall by 10% of GDP.

The table below shows the attribution of the changes in some detail. As shown, during the ugly deflationary
depression phrase from 1929-1931, incomes collapsed as nominal GDP fell 9% per year, mostly from deflation,
though real growth fell as well. As a result, nominal growth was 14% below nominal rates, and debt to GDP rose
at a rate of 11% per year. After the devaluation, nominal growth recovered at a rate of 7% in this period, a
combination of 6% real growth and moderate 1-2% inflation eroding domestic debt burdens. Nearly half of the
recovery in nominal GDP came from a rebound in exports that was supported by the more competitive yen and
global recovery. This level of growth, combined with low interest rates, kept nominal GDP growing 2% above
nominal rates. Accordingly, the private sector reduced its debt burdens, though the government kept borrowing
through the period.

As shown below, the biggest driver of the increase in debt relative to GDP in the ugly deleveraging phase was
deflation. At the same time, a real growth contraction further pushed incomes downward and borrowing to pay
for interest payments pushed debts higher. After the gold peg was broken in late 1931, debt to GDP gradually fell,
as rising income from real growth and inflation offset increasing debt stocks.

The private sector saw nearly all of their increase in debt/GDP from the ugly deleveraging stage reversed as
inflation and real growth boosted incomes and offset interest burdens. Note that we do not have good
information on whether defaults played a material role in the deleveraging.

The chart below shows nominal GDP growth during the two phases of the deleveraging. In the ugly deleveraging
phase, a deflation rate of 7.4% shrank incomes, even as the contraction in real growth was more modest.
Following the devaluation, nominal GDP grew at an average rate of 7.0% per year due to strong real growth and
more modest inflation.

following the devaluation bringing nominal rates above nominal interest rates, Japan was able to gradually lower

UK Deleveraging, 1947-1969
The charts below show debt levels against nominal GDP growth year over year (left chart) and against the total
return of stocks (right chart). Debt levels as % of GDP are on the right axis of each chart. The line shows where
a significant amount of “money printing” occurred. The first phase is labeled (1) and the second phase is labeled
(2). The UK acquired lots of debt both before and during World War II and entered a recession at the end of
World War II, pushing debt burdens higher. As shown, from the end of 1943 to the end of 1947 debt levels rose
from just above 250% of GDP to 400%. While in 1948 debt burdens dipped a bit with a recovery in incomes, in
September 1949 the UK printed money and devalued the pound by 30% against the dollar and gold, at the same
time also keeping short rates basically at zero. As a result nominal growth rose above nominal interest rates,
debt levels fell by 250% and stocks rallied between 1948 and 1969.

At the same time that the UK kept interest rates low with easy money during the period, there was a big currency
devaluation in 1949 and the BOE increased asset purchases to about 1% GDP in 1950, both of which helped to
keep nominal growth above nominal interest rates, which was the most important influence in lowering the
debt/income ratio.

period

As shown below, as a result of this mix in policies, the decline in total debt in the post-war period occurred via a
rise in nominal GDP which outpaced more modest increases in the amount of new borrowing. Inflation of around
4% from 1947-1970 drove nearly 2/3 of the decline in debt to GDP that is attributable to GDP growth. Net new
borrowing was small as borrowing for interest payments was offset by paying down debts. This is shown in the
chart below.

The same is true for both the government and the private sector. The net new borrowing by the government was
relatively small through the period, particularly from 1947-1960. The charts below show the attributions of the

Japan Deleveraging, 1990-Present
As shown below, Japan has been stuck in a moderate “ugly deflationary deleveraging” for over 20 years. In 1989
the private sector debt bubble burst and government sector debt/fiscal expansion began, but there was never
adequate “money printing/monetization” to cause nominal growth to be above nominal interest rates and to
have the currency devalue. While Japan has eased some, nominal income growth has been stagnant, with
persistent deflation eroding moderate real growth. Meanwhile, nominal debts have risen much faster, pushing
debt levels higher, from about 400% of GDP at the end of 1989 to 500% today. Equities have declined by nearly
70%.

The BOJ has “printed/monetized” very little in duration-adjusted terms throughout the deleveraging process,
with most of the printing that it has done going to short-term cash-like assets of little duration. As result, it has
failed to reflate and the government is building a terrible debt burden.

As shown in the table below, money creation has been limited at 0.7% of GDP per year, and the yen has
appreciated 2.9% per year against the dollar. As a result, since 1990 real growth has averaged 1.1% with
persistent deflation (averaging -0.5%). This has left nominal growth 2% below nominal interest rates which
cumulatively has led to a large increase in the debt/income ratio. While the private sector has delevered
modestly, Japan’s total debt level has climbed from 403% to 498% because of government borrowing and
deflation.

The charts below show how the Japan case developed over time, breaking out the cumulative contributions of
different drivers to changes in debt burdens relative to incomes. In aggregate in the economy, new borrowing
has merely covered continued debt service and no more. Persistent deflation has added to debt burdens, while
defaults and real growth have reduced them.

US Deleveraging, 2008-Present
Like the US deleveraging in the 1930s, the lead-up consisted of a debt driven boom, and the deleveraging has
transpired in two stages: a contraction in incomes followed by reflation and growth. However, because of a swift
policy response from the Fed, which was prompt in guaranteeing debt and aggressively printing money, the
contractionary period only lasted six months (versus over three years in the 1930s), and since then there has
been reflation and debt reduction through a mix of rising nominal incomes, default and debt repayment.
As shown in the charts below, unlike both the US in the 1930s and Japan since 1990, the US has quickly entered a
reflation and ended the “ugly deflationary deleveraging” phase of the process (which lasted from July 2008, just
before Lehman fell, to March 2009, when the Fed instituted its aggressive program of quantitative easing to
monetize the debts). During the “ugly” phase, incomes fell, debt burdens rose from about 340% GDP to 370%
and stocks lost almost half their value. Because so much debt around the world is dollar denominated, the
contraction in global credit and dollar liquidity created a squeeze for dollars, and the dollar strengthened
significantly against a trade-weighted basket. Exports collapsed faster than domestic demand. Following the
reflation that began in March 2009, incomes recovered, debt burdens fell below their initial starting level to
around 335% and stocks recovered all of their losses. At this time, the credit markets are largely healed and
private sector credit growth is improving. Thus far, this deleveraging would win my award of the most beautiful
deleveraging on record. The key going forward will be for policy makers to maintain balance so that the
debt/income ratio keeps declining in an orderly way.

The magnitude of the easing by the Fed has been substantial. Not only did the Fed cut rates and backstop
essential credit during the liquidity crisis, but it pursued one of the most aggressive easing policies by pushing
money into risky assets. The Fed began to push money into the system with the announcement of a significant
QE1 in March 2009 with the purchase of Treasuries and agency-backed bonds. The Fed further increased its
holdings of longer duration government debt (mostly Treasuries) with QE2 starting in August 2010 and
Operation Twist starting in the fall 2011. During these three periods, changes in asset holdings on a durationadjusted basis (equivalent to 10-year duration) peaked at 8%, 5% and roughly 2% of GDP annualized pace
respectively.

As shown below, during the contractionary period, nominal growth fell at an annualized rate of -5.4% due to a
collapse in real activity between July 2008 and February 2009. Falling incomes sent the debt to GDP level
higher, even as credit creation collapsed.
In March 2009, the Fed eased aggressively through QE, as discussed, buying government bonds and pushing a
massive amount of money into the system (more than $1.5 trillion). This push of money and the subsequent
reflation of assets stimulated a recovery in economic activity, which rebounded at a rate of 3.5% per year.
Nominal growth has been marginally higher than nominal government rates. Debt levels have fallen 13% of GDP
per year, because the private sector has deleveraged while government borrowing has risen. Nominal growth
contributed to an annualized 12% decline in the debt/income ratio, defaults contributed to a 6% reduction and
repayments contributed to a 15% reduction while interest payments contributed to a 20% increase in the
debt/income ratio.

As shown, debt levels increased during the contraction phase but declined in response to reflation so that they
are now down a bit from the starting point. With debt levels so high, interest payments have been a significant
burden, but they have been offset by a mix of paying down debts, moderate inflation and defaults, with debt
repayment the largest component.

The Recent Spain Deleveraging, 2008-Present
As shown below, Spain has been going through the first and “ugly deflationary” phase of the cycle and has not
yet moved on because it can’t “print/monetize”; it is dependent on the ECB to do this. As shown, incomes also
began to fall in Spain from July 2008 and debts rose from that point from about 365% to close to 400%. Debt
burdens have since stabilized but are still higher than at the start of the deleveraging. Equities initially fell nearly
45% and are still 25% below July 2008 levels.

Though Spain has not been able to print money directly, the ECB has pushed a significant amount of money into
Spain by buying its bonds and providing liquidity to its banks which prevented a more severe deleveraging. It
provided this support in the summer of 2010 and again in the fall of 2011, when credit tightened. During both
these periods, peak purchases by the ECB pushed money into Spanish risky assets at a rate of more than 10% of
Spanish GDP (adjusted to a 10-year duration). The push of money has come from a mix of sovereign and
covered bond purchases, and shorter-term loans, such as the recent LTRO. Despite this printing the ECB has not
pushed Spanish sovereign spreads and interest rates down enough so that nominal growth is above nominal
rates (as shown later).

Understandably, in Spain the policy response has been much slower than in the US because the policy options
are limited, most importantly because Spain cannot print money. And understandably, Spain has seen its credit
spread climb and rising debt service costs have sent debt/income levels much higher. Unlike in our other cases,
Spain’s government bond yield has a substantial credit risk component because of Spain's inability to print.
Nominal growth has been negative during the Spanish deleveraging because inflation has been 0.6% and real
growth has been -1.1%. As a result, nominal growth has been 5.5% below government bond yields. The euro
has devalued 20% against gold on an annualized basis, but much less against the dollar as all major currencies
have devalued against gold.

As shown below, Spain’s debt level has increased due to a high and rising interest burden, new borrowing above
interest payments and negative real growth. Rising interest payments are the largest component here as higher
Spanish credit spreads have increased debt service costs. Inflation and defaults have moderately reduced debt
burdens.

At this time, while the ECB’s moves have helped, the prospects remain poor for Spain because, with monetary
policies where they are, nominal growth will remain weak and too much of the adjustment process will depend
on austerity and debt reduction.

Germany’s Weimar Republic: 1918-23
Weimar Germany is a case where hyperinflation and default eroded the punishingly high debt burdens. In 1918,
the government ended the war with a debt to GDP ratio of about 160% after their considerable borrowing to
finance war spending. Total government obligations rose to an extraordinary level of 913% GDP after the Allied
parties imposed reparation payments on Germany to be paid in gold.8 1918 and 1919 was a period of economic
contraction, with real incomes falling 5% and 10% in those two years. The Reich then spurred a recovery in
incomes and asset prices at the end of this period by devaluing the paper mark against the dollar and gold by
50% between December 1919 and Feb 1920. As the currency fell, inflation took off. Between 1920 and 1922,
inflation eroded government debts denominated in local currency, but made no impact on the reparation debt
since it was owed in gold. But in the summer of 1922, the Reich stopped making payments on reparations,
effectively going into default.9 Over a series of negotiations lasting until 1932, the reparation debts were
restructured and effectively wiped out. The currency depreciation led creditors to favor short-term loans and to
move money out of the currency which required the central bank to buy more debt in order to fill in the void.
This spiral led to hyperinflation that peaked in 1923 and left local government debt at 0.09% GDP.

The Reichsbank increased its printing after the 1919/20 devaluation and the printing accelerated in 1922 and
1923. By the end of the hyperinflation in 1923 the Reichsbank had increased the money supply by 1.2 trillion
percent between 1919 and 1923.

We show the debt level rising after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles made clear the reparations would be huge; the exact amount was initially
set by the start of 1921 at 269 billion gold marks and then subsequently restructured.
9
In the spring of 1921 the Allied Reparations Commission restructured the reparations, cutting them by half to 132 billion marks, but this debt
still remained extremely high at about 325% GDP. After the Reich stopped paying reparations in the summer of 1922, the debts were
restructured multiple times – to 112 in 1929, and then basically wiped out in 1932.

The case of Weimar is one of the most extreme inflationary deleveragings ever. At the end of the war, the Reich
government was forced to choose between a shortage of cash and economic contraction or printing to stimulate
incomes. The government chose to print and devalue to stimulate the economy, beginning with a 50%
devaluation at the end of 1919 that brought the economy out of recession. Eventually, a loss of confidence in the
currency and an extreme amount of printing led to hyperinflation and left the currency basically worthless. As
shown below, the currency fell essentially 100% against gold and printing was exponential. Starting debt of
913% fell to basically zero. Non-reparations government debt of 133% GDP in 1919 was wiped out by inflation.
Gold-based reparation of 780% GDP effectively went into default in the summer of 1922 when reparation
payments were halted. I summarize this in the table below and then go through the pieces.

As discussed, the non-reparations government debt was eroded rapidly through inflation. While the reparations
were not techincally imposed until 1921, they effectively existed shortly after the war and it was mostly a
question of negotiating how big they would be (the official amount was settled at the start of 1921 and then
reduced that spring by about 50%, still a huge sum). Because the reparations were denominated in gold, they
held their value until Germany ceased payments in 1922. They were then restrutured several times over the next
decade until they were effectively wiped out.

US Deleveraging 1930s
This document provides a timeline for the U.S. Deleveraging in the 1930s. I wrote it in a way to both make clear
important cause and effect relationships and to convey an up-close feeling of what it was like to go through the
experience as an investor. As a result, sometimes you will read about market action in detail that has no
historical importance but provides perspective for investors trying to navigate such moves. For example,
throughout this period there were giant market whip-saws and swings in sentiment that misled and hurt many.
Also, the waves of destruction in asset values that occurred through changing market values and asset
confiscations were enormous. So it is important that we, as managers of our clients’ wealth, visualize how we
would have navigated these changes. Only by going through this experience virtually, as well as going through
the other deleveragings (the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, Latin America in the 1980s and Japan in the 1990s)
and testing our strategies can we be confident that we can successfully navigate the next few years.
This timeline is meant to be read with frequent reference to the accompanying charts that show all markets and
stats that I believe are important. Facts and notes for the timeline were taken from several books shown in the
bibliography in the back.

Preface
Money serves two purposes – it is a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth. So it serves two masters – 1)
those who want to obtain it for “life’s necessities,” usually by working for it and 2) those who have the value of
their stored wealth tied to its value. Throughout history these two groups have been called different things – e.g.,
the first group has been called workers, the proletariat, and “the have-nots” and the second group has been
called capitalists, investors, and “the haves.” For simplicity, I will call the first group workers and the second
group investors. They, along with the government (which sets the rules), are the major players in this drama for
money.
Like many dramas, this one both arises and transpires in ways that have reoccurred through time, going back to
before Roman times. One man’s financial assets are another man’s financial liabilities (i.e., promises to deliver
money). When the claims of financial assets are too high relative to the money available to meet them, a
deleveraging arises. In the last couple of centuries, this happened when the ability to increase financial assets,
most importantly credit, has been impaired because monetary policy is dysfunctional, often because interest
rates are at 0% and can’t be lowered further. As a result, the claims (i.e., financial wealth) need to fall relative to
what they are claims on (i.e., money). This happens through extinguishing the claims (e.g., bankruptcies) and/or
increasing the supply of money.
This fundamental imbalance between the size of the claims on money and the supply of money has occurred
many times in history and has always been resolved in some mix of the two previously mentioned ways. This
resolution process is painful for all of the players. In fact, the pain has sometimes been so bad that some
civilizations turned against the capitalist system (i.e., the system based on this type of capital formation). For
example, some historians say that the problems that arose from credit creation were why charging interest was a
sin of usury in both the Catholic Church as well as in the Arab religions. Throughout the Middle Ages, no
Christian could charge interest to another Christian, so the Jews played a large part in the development of trade
because it was the Jews who lent money for business ventures and financed voyages. But the Jews were also
moneylenders who debtors could not repay, and this often led to anti-Semitism. Supposedly, much of the killing
of Jews was caused by them holding the mortgages on property and creditors wanting to extinguish the debts.
Debtor-creditor relationships have typically turned very antagonistic in these fights for money and many other
patterns of human behavior that are important to know about regularly surfaced during these dramatic times.
Other relationships and the actions of various players were comparably noteworthy. So it is very important for
us to read these historic dramas.
The Great Depression is probably the greatest such drama in recorded history. It is certainly a classic that must
be studied by anyone who cares about wealth preservation and the well-being of society. Additionally, it is the Dprocess that is most similar to the current dynamic because it was the last global deleveraging.

Conditions in 1929 Leading up to the Crash
As long as there has been money and it has been lent, the biggest issue has been the value of the money. Since
being paid back with goods (e.g., wheat) doesn’t work well for many reasons, debts are typically denominated in
money, but lenders need some assurances that governments won’t just print up a lot of it and devalue their
claims. In the 1920’s, these assurances were made by governments promising to exchange their money for gold
at a fixed exchange rate. In other words, the world was on a gold standard back then. This played an important
role in determining how events transpired in the 1920’s, leading up to the crash, but I won’t get into that now.
The important thing to know is that the world was on a gold standard then.
1929 was a year of spectacular economic growth10 which was great for both workers and investors. The
unemployment rate was down to less than 1%, which was the lowest since 1920, and corporate profits were the
highest that they had ever been. The stock market’s strength seemed to benefit everyone. Credit was readily
available which allowed a lot of borrowing to buy stocks, houses, investment assets and many other things at
high prices. Prior years were similar, though less extreme.
Stockbrokers fueled the rapid expansion of their business by offering easy credit terms.11 The call loan market, a
relatively new and rapidly growing market, rose rapidly, quite like the securitized debt market grew in 2005-07.
The diversion of funds to invest in the call loan market by corporations, foreigners, and individuals reflected a
speculation in credit, motivated by attractive interest rates, that fueled the speculative mania in stocks of the
period in much the same way the carry trade did in 2006-2007.12
Stocks sold at extremely high multiples financed by borrowing (i.e., margin). Many stocks were valued as much
as 30 to 50 times earnings. Then money started to tighten. In May 1928, the Federal Reserve System began
tightening credit, raising its discount rate to 4 ½%. It was raised again to 5% in July 1928 and to 6% in August
1929.13
Required margin deposits also rose before the crash. Most brokers became concerned about the extent of their
margin loans at the high stock prices and in the face of higher interest rates in midsummer of 1929. So brokers
began to raise the margin requirements on loans from 10%-25% to 50% by the Crash.14 Also, prior to the
Crash, brokers tried to reduce their call loan exposure on margin accounts.
Banks were strong going into the Crash and not over-leveraged. The leading banks had great strength because
they had deposits that were not more than seven times their capital and surplus. This was a conservative ratio,
especially when only 60% of bank assets were typically in loans and up to one-third of those were call loans,
which were short-term.15
In August, the Fed eased a bit16 because the economy slowed in reaction to the earlier tightening, so production
peaked in most industries in the first half of the year, before the Crash.17
The peak in the market occurred on the first trading day in September, at 381 on the Dow Jones Industrial Index.
Keep this price in mind as we will track the Dow’s level through this timeline. Most people were bullish at the
time, but a few notable, knowledgeable and independent thinkers gave warnings. For example, Roger Babson had

“become shrill” in predicting the coming collapse of prices because of “tight money,” so he recommended selling
stocks in September and again in October.
In the first week of October there was a big drop in stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Index declined in two
days from 344 to 325, or 6%. Margin calls were numerous. 18 Some brokers were rumored to be in trouble
because of the heavy slate of initial public offerings which continued unabated. But, in the second week of
October, prices bounced back to 352, though they soon started to slip again.
It became widely known that big margin calls and sell orders existed on October 24th, so everyone who worked
on the exchange was alerted to be prepared. Then the collapse and panic came. There was a tidal wave of panic,
not a gradual loss of confidence. The streets of the financial district were in an uproar from shortly after the
opening of the Exchange as investors heard of the disaster and, unable to gain information through normal
channels, went to the Exchange to seek information firsthand.
An attempt to stabilize the market was made by a small group of the biggest bankers known as “the Bankers’
Pool,” who committed to buy $125 million in shares at about 12:00 noon. At midday Richard Whitney, the
president of the Exchange, went on to the floor to the post for U.S. Steel and bid $205 for 25,000 shares (over $5
million) and other members of the pool behaved similarly. This caused a big bounce in the stock market. The
leading stocks had been down 15%-20%, but they bounced early as fast as they had gone down. Professionals,
speculators, and coolheaded investors bought aggressively as they believed that we had seen a correction that
was a great buying opportunity. The Dow Jones Industrial Index bounced back 26 points from a low for the day
of 272 (down 33) to close at 299 (down 6).19 This classic pattern of big moves to support the market leading to
big accompanying bounces would repeat numerous times throughout the bear market.
At the end of Black Thursday, a second organized effort to help the market was formed by a group of brokers.
Some 35 leading brokers accounting for 70% of NYSE business assembled at the offices of Hornblower & Weeks
and agreed that the worst was over and that they should act to reassure their customers. They took out a full
page ad in the New York Times the next day, confidently telling the public that it was a great time to buy.20 This
would not be the last time that those who listened to the confident advice of their brokers and advisors would be
misled. Prices started to slide again. Over the weekend, margin calls went out and foreign banks were reported
to be switching out of brokers call loans and buying bankers acceptances, to seek safety. At the same time,
prices were bid up for U.S. government and high grade railroad bonds, as investors sought safety.
On Monday night, margin calls were enormous, and heavy Dutch and German selling came in overnight for the
Tuesday morning opening. On Tuesday morning, out-of-town banks and corporations pulled $150 million of call
loans and Wall Street was in a panic before the Exchange opened.21 The Fed responded, as central banks
typically do in such circumstances, by providing liquidity. The immediate problem to be dealt with by the Federal
Reserve and the New York City banks was the collapse of the call loan market,22 as it withdrew the credit that
investors had used to fund their positions. So, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York bought $25 million in U.S.
securities to inject funds into the banking system so the banks could increase their call loans.23
Once again, opportunistic buying came into the market and the market rallied in the last 15 minutes of Tuesday,
October 29th, triggering optimism.24 Nonetheless, the combined decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Index for
Monday and Tuesday was 20%. So, the contraction in wealth and the problems of leveraged holders of assets
had begun.

On Wednesday morning, October 30th, the stock market opened strong. The NYSE announced after
Wednesday’s close that trading on Thursday, October 31st, would begin at noon and that the Exchange would
close on Friday and Saturday to catch up on paperwork.
Then the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cut its discount rate from 6% to 5% in coordination with the Bank of
England, which cut its bank rate from 6 ½% to 6%.25 Classically, the announcements stimulated strong buying
when the exchange opened, but not enough to cause prices to go to new highs. So the rally didn’t last, as
leveraged longs were being squeezed.
Stocks continued to plunge the next week, starting with a stampede to sell when the NYSE opened on Monday,
November 4th. On Tuesday the exchanges were closed for Armistice Day. On Wednesday, November 6th, the
stock markets opened with heavy selling. Stocks continued to fall the next week.26
The Crash helped high grade and railroad bonds and hurt BAA and other lower quality bonds. The yields on BAA
industrial and utility bonds dropped a little, in contrast to high grade bonds, so that the yield spreads between
BAA and AA bonds became the widest in 1929.
Municipal bonds constituted one of the larger securities markets in 1929, second only to the U.S. government
bond market. In 1929 the municipal bond market behaved much like the corporate bond market. Bond prices
declined enough to raise yields by ¼% to ½%, a progression throughout the year in response to the investor
surge into the stock market and tightening short-term credit conditions and then prices rose and yields declined
during the Crash as investors leaving the stock market created a strong demand for high quality municipals.
However, some regions where there was a financial bubble, such as Florida, were already in default. More Florida
defaults were anticipated, including a default by Miami, whose bonds yielded 5.75%, 1% above any other major
city’s bonds.
On Wednesday, November 13th, John D. Rockefeller placed a bid for 1 million shares of Standard Oil (N.J.) at $50,
down $33 from its 1929 high of $83. Then, the administration felt that it had to do something so, after the close
on November 13th, Treasury Secretary Mellon announced that the United States would reduce corporate and
individual income taxes by 1% to stimulate confidence, and they prohibited short selling. In response to these
moves and to stocks appearing cheap, the market bottomed on November 14th and rallied 25% through
December.27
Most everyone thought the problems were over and many regretted not buying when prices were cheap.
Speculators resumed their past activities. The Chairman of the Chase National Bank reinvested heavily in stocks.
William Durant created a new pool in Radio Corp. of America stock. The Chairman of General Theatres
Equipment, Inc., organized a new pool in his own company’s 6% convertible debentures with Chase Securities,
etc.28

Government Policies
Herbert Hoover had been president only seven months when the Crash occurred. The day after the Crash he
issued his famous statement: “The fundamental business of the country, that is production and distribution of
commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis.”
Contrary to what is popularly believed, the Hoover Administration was prompt and positive in its reaction to the
Crash. For example, Hoover arranged for a committee of 400 businessmen to advise the President on business

conditions. It was led by a “Committee of 72”, which was made up of men who seemed like titans in the business
and social world of the 1920s,29 so it consisted of the best of the best. The Hoover Administration hoped that the
Crash would destroy excessive speculation but not the economy,30 much the same way the Bush administration
viewed the initial declines as a healthy correction of speculative excesses. The federal government also
expanded its public works plans to $250 million for 1930. This constituted the most active and direct role in the
economy taken by the federal government in generations, and the policy appeared to work.
Also, Hoover’s policy supported the Federal Reserve in its policy of credit easing.31 President Hoover’s attack on
the impending Depression, together with the easy money that the Fed provided, were generally expected to
produce an economic upswing by mid-1930.
As mentioned, the Fed eased aggressively when the crash occurred. The day before Black Thursday the New
York Federal Reserve reduced its buying rate for bankers acceptances from 5 1/8% to 5%. Then, during the
Crash, the New York Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate from 6% to 5% on November 1st and to 4 ½% on
November 15th. On the same dates, it reduced its buying rate for bankers acceptances to 4 ¾% and 4 ¼%.
Another reduction to 4% on November 21st prevailed until January 31st, 1930.32

1H1930

Optimism Returns
In 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market action had had a 50% correction33 that was over, largely
because those sorts of moves are what people remembered.
A number of well-known analysts pointed to value and earnings as reasons why the market was fundamentally
sound. Then, like now, people remembered past cyclical downturns, especially those in 1920, 1914 and 1907, and
pointed out that 50% corrections occurred in these cases and that the worst was over back in 1920 within 130
days of the top. However, the reasons for the various panics prior to 1929 were different. In some cases, panics
were caused by drastic declines in the gold reserves prompting a lack of confidence in government’s ability to
meet its debts with sound money, which sent capital fleeing from banks into safe securities and even into
hoarding gold. In other cases, panic was created by natural disasters which seriously disrupted the cash flow
between various sectors of the United States, sparking bank failures which gave rise to the birth of the Federal
Reserve.34 The optimism wasn’t just confined to market participants. All the Federal Reserve districts predicted
an upturn in the economy in the second half of 1930. The commercial banks also forecast an upturn. So, in
1H1930, optimism prevailed.
The banking system was considered strong at the time.35 Loans and investments of all member banks expanded
steadily through 1930. Their investments in U.S. government securities, municipals, railroad bonds, utility bonds,
and foreign bonds all expanded throughout the year, and the new-issue market for common stocks recovered,
too.36
From the depths of the panic in late 1929, the market had begun to recover moving through the first quarter of
1930.37 The stock market rose strongly in the first four months of 1930. For those who still had money, 1930
held the opportunity for a killing.38 Stocks seemed cheap because they fell faster than the economy, so prices

were low in relation to earnings. For example, AT&T was only off 0.1% in earnings, yet the stock price was 25%
lower than at the 1929 high.39 Outside Wall Street, industry looked strong. So in the first quarter of 1930 it was
widely believed that stocks were clearly in a 50% correction and nothing more,40 so stocks rose as the Fed eased
and the Hoover administration was responsive to the problems.41 On March 31, Congress passed a stimulus
package called the Public Buildings Act and on April 4 approved an appropriation for state road building projects
in order to help stimulate the economy.
Bonds remained steady during January and February despite the Fed’s cut in the discount rate during February,
but in March they rallied in response to a second cut to 3.5%. The Fed had cut the discount rate from 6% to
3.5% in just seven months in an attempt to halt the decline in the economy. Interest rates plummeted straight
down during the first quarter of 1930.42
As mentioned, the Fed bought a lot of T-Bills following the crash and until March 1930. Additionally, it is
noteworthy that the Directors of the New York Fed and its professional staff wanted to buy a lot of U.S.
government bonds to prevent the decline in Federal Reserve credit resulting from the decline in the Federal
Reserve’s bill holdings. However, the Federal Reserve Board in Washington opposed the New York bank’s
requests, fearing that it would scare foreign investors and weaken the dollar.43
For all these reasons, optimism ran fairly high during the first quarter of 1930.44 By April 10th, the Dow had rallied
back up to 293.36. But poor earnings reports continued. In that sense, the stock market action, economic
activity, Fed moves and the administration’s moves were broadly similar to those in 2008 and early 2009. In
other words, despite monetary and fiscal stimulation and a general sense that stocks had gotten cheap and the
economy was in a normal contraction, economic weakness persisted and dragged stocks lower.

2H1930

Trade Wars, Economic Weakness, Financial Losses,
and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
The economic weakness was global as well as domestic. During this second quarter of 1930 world trade and
production declined and unemployment increased.45 Even with a big fiscal stimulus (about 1% of GDP), and the
Fed easing, the world economy weakened. Naturally (i.e., typical of bad downturns) trade tensions and
protectionist sentiment emerged. In the U.S., it was widely argued that industries would rebound as long as
Europe was forced to stop its dumping policies. While workers and capitalists in industries that had to compete
with imports generally liked tariffs, foreigners and those who traded or dealt in world markets didn’t. As the
week of June 16 began, the news of what would become known as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act weighed on the
stock market46 even though it raised by tariffs by only 20%. Though workers liked tariffs, investors did not. On
Monday, June 16th, stocks gapped down. The Dow Jones industrials plummeted to 212.27, closing the week at
215.30.47 The selling pressure continued the following week as the industrials fell to 207.74, off 14.9% from the
close of June 14.
The Senate and the House passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill on June 17, raising U.S. tariffs by 20% on average,
making U.S. tariffs the highest in the world. Several other countries immediately did the same.48
To convey how tariffs changed over time, most importantly how they increased in economic bad times, we show
the following interesting chart that we stumbled across. Protectionism is an almost certain consequence of
economic bad times.

It is a mistake to attribute the deleveraging to the Smoot-Hawley tariff,49 as U.S. exports as a percentage of GDP
in terms of constant dollars were only 5.28% in 1929 and declined to 4.44% in 1931, so they were rather small
and declined a bit more than proportionally with the total economy. The economic contraction which took place
worldwide was primarily created by the asset bubble bursting and the debt crisis emerging.
Hoover planned a fiscal 1931 budget surplus, but the likelihood of a surplus diminished as 1930 progressed. In
the fiscal year ending June 1931 there was a budget deficit of $463 million because of a $1 billion decline in
federal receipts. Increasing budget deficits in periods of economic hardship are virtually inevitable.

The Real Economy Deteriorates
In the second half of 1930, the economy weakened.50 Then, as now, auto production dropped to about 50% of
capacity and the commodities-based industries, such as the oil, mining, farm equipment, and pulp and paper
industries, suffered declines.51 In less than two quarters steel production utilization dropped from 95% to 60%
of capacity and commodities prices fell sharply. Housing and mortgage debt collapsed.52 Classically, these
industries decline as the demand for discretionary durables, oil and commodities used in production declines.
On September 9, 1930, President Hoover stopped all immigration with the exception of tourists, students and
professional men and women, and the Labor Department was also instructed to rigidly enforce the laws against
illegal aliens, so in 1930 thousands of deportations were made.53 Moves to curtail immigration and to force
immigrants to leave the country are also typical of deleveragings.
At the end of the year the index of prices for 47 farm products was down 29.3% from pre-Crash prices, and
publicly traded industrial commodities averaged a price decline of approximately 25%. Hoover declared that
speculators who sold commodities short were conspiring against the public welfare.54 Demonizing those who
made money betting on the decline is also typical of deleveragings.
In 1930, earnings declined. According to a survey by Moody’s taken of the first 744 companies to report on their
1930 earnings, there was a 23.2% average decline in corporate earnings in comparison to 1929’s strong earnings.
But this average figure is a bit misleading because of differences. Of the total, half were industrial corporations,
which posted a decline in earnings of 35.9% for 1930,55 while other industries such as utilities (including the
telephone and telegraph companies) were unaffected. In fact, through most of 1930, many industries were not
yet doing all that badly as consumer spending did not drop off that sharply at this point. So, the 1930s fall in
earnings looked like a shallow recession.

June was the worst month for the stock market in 1930. The Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped almost 23%,56
commodities prices broke their lowest levels since 1914 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff was passed. Lowering
money rates and reducing brokers loans had no effect.57 Then, as now, the Treasury bond market was strong
while credit spreads widened.58
The stock market stabilized for the summer months, though the news was bad – e.g., Miami defaulted, Warner
Bros. and Shell Union Oil halted their dividends, and the budget deficit outlook worsened.59
However, the majority of market analysts began to turn bullish during August of 1930 and prices rallied to a peak
of 247 on September 10th, though the economy continued to slide and liquidity fears60 were beginning to arise.
Once again, market participants over-anticipated a recovery that didn’t materialize, and the disappointing reality
of the economy drove prices lower.
Railroads then were like autos now, in that they had problems rolling their maturing debts and faced large
rollovers ahead (in 1931) and the government considered providing them with special loans because they were
considered to be an essential industry that was too important to allow to fail. For this reason, the story of the
railroads during the Great Depression is worth noting for those trying to anticipate the fate of the autos over the
next few years.
Then, like in 2008, despite a severe decline in government interest rates, corporate bonds eventually collapsed61
as public confidence gave way and mortgage spreads to treasuries increased. Specifically, interest rates on first
mortgages stayed at 5.5% to 6% while seconds yielded at least 7%, because despite the decline in government
rates, banks were still maintaining high rates on mortgages62 because of the increased credit risks and the banks
fears of illiquidity. Municipal bonds and municipal governments did well in 1930 until credit fears developed in
the last quarter.63
In October of 1930, the stock market broke its November 1929 lows.64

Bank Failures Begin
During the Crash and in 1930, there was a lot of talk about the strength of the banking system and the strength of
the banks was expected to limit the duration of the contraction. Bank earnings generally declined only
25%-30% in 1930, and four of the top ten banks paid higher dividends in 1930. So, banks appeared strong
through most of 1930.65
However, some banks began to look vulnerable when the economy and stock market weakened late in 1930. The
decline in the stock market in the second half of 1930 made some banks especially vulnerable because they
owned stocks.66 Also, some important banks had also engaged in unsound speculation and made unsound
loans. Other banks were affected by the impact of declining commodities prices on their customers’ credit and
by the worsening economic conditions, particularly those banks that had large real estate loans. Runs eventually
occurred in numerous cities during 1930. However, the majority of early bank failures were confined to banks in
the Midwest and country banks that had a lot of money in real estate loans.67
Many bankers had liquidity problems because they held many illiquid foreign bonds, real estate loans, railroad
loans, and investment loans, so they sought safety and liquidity in the short-term market then, in much the same
was as they did in 2008 and early 2009. During the first six months of 1930, 471 banks failed, though none of
the big ones.
Then, like now, the velocity of money fell as credit contracted and people moved to holding cash. The hoarding
of gold coins began to increase by late 1929 as the government stopped issuing new gold coinage.68
Through all of 1930, 1,350 banks suspended operations, compared with 659 banks in 1929,69 but bank failures
weren’t a big worry.70 Also, Wall St. brokerage firms started failing.71 Financial companies which had employed
high leverage in 1929 paid a heavy price for it in 1930.72 Goldman Sachs Trading wrote down its portfolio value
$165 million at the end of 1930 in order to bring it to market value. Then, as now, almost half the write-offs were
on securities for which no adequate public market existed.73 Also, investment funds at the Wall Street firms
began to collapse as managers lost most of their clients’ money. For example, Goldman Sachs’ two leading funds
both fell by about 90%.
It wasn’t until December 1930 that bank failures became a big deal. Until then, the majority of bank failures had
been in the Midwest. But in December, the Bankers Trust Co. in Philadelphia failed, which was followed by the
failure of the Bank of United States.74 Manufacturers Trust Company also experienced runs at some branches
and needed help from the Clearing House Association. Bank stocks plunged. The reputations of U.S. banks
suffered abroad, where the Bank of United States was thought to be more important than it actually was because
of its name.75
Back then, there was no active lender-of-last-resort role at the Federal Reserve to deal with smaller regional
banks, so the Bank of United States got no lender-of-last-resort loans. The Federal Reserve did what its role
proscribed when bank suspensions accelerated in November and December 1930, i.e., it increased its open

market purchases aggressively, so that its holdings of T-bills doubled by December 31st.76 Back then, the role of
the Federal Reserve was to control money supply and not to determine who got money and who didn’t.
Political shifts follow economic shifts. This time was no different. The Democrats swept Congress in the
November mid-term elections. Still, at the end of 1930, a majority of those in finance and business predicted that
there would be an economic recovery in 1931.77

International Problems
The foreign debt problem had also become a big drag on the global economy, which hurt the U.S. economy.
Then, as now, these debts were heavily denominated in U.S. dollars. Then, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board privately advised Hoover to cut war debts by 70% and reparations by 40% to improve international trade
and financial conditions, but this was rejected because it was felt that the U.S. needed the money.78 All the
countries of Western Europe and the United Kingdom had dollar-denominated bond issues after the war and, in
varying degrees, were facing problems coming up with dollars, which then, as this time around, strengthened the
dollar.
In the boom years, emerging market debt had become popular as it seemed to offer higher interest rates with not
much risk. Issues of South American governments had been especially popular. For example, Argentine bonds
were rated Aa by Moody’s, which also gave an A bond rating to Buenos Aires, Chile, Cuba, Peru, Rio Grande do
Sul, and Uruguay. Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Rio de Janeiro were rated Baa, which still implied investment
quality. Rates on these bonds were 1%-2% over comparably rated domestic corporate issues in 1928-1929
when the carry trade was popular.79 But in 1930, U.S. investors didn’t want to roll over maturing foreign debt.80
Foreign governments with maturing issues had to resort to short-term borrowing. Then, as now, these countries
didn’t get loans from the U.S. government. Later in the deleveraging, many of these countries defaulted on their
U.S. bond issues.
France and Great Britain were heavily in debt to the United States, but the greatest source of instability was
Germany, which had built up massive international short-term debts that it could not service or roll. Germany
had a huge reparations burden, it lacked foreign exchange reserves, the savings of individuals had been wiped out
by hyperinflation in the early 1920s, and the rest of Europe feared a rebirth of German militarism so it tried to
hold Germany back economically. Since hyperinflation and reparations payments eliminated domestic savings,
both German industry and government were forced to borrow abroad.81 As it was short of cash, Germany’s
central bank, the Reichsbank, raised its rate from 4% to 5% in October in order to raise short-term funds.82 By
this time Hitler had emerged on the scene and created a problem for the governing Social Democrats, thus
destabilizing their ability to govern, making investors more wary about lending to Germany.
Similarly, economic problems in South America caused political and social problems there. In September there
was a revolt in Chile and a revolution in Argentina and in October a rebel coup in Brazil.83 Naturally, this
turbulence scared investors both foreign and domestic, and this scared capital away, worsening their problems!
During such times of great stress, political and social polarization emerges as various strongly held opposing
views, especially of “the have-nots” (workers) and “the haves” (investors), and this makes it difficult for leaders
to govern. Such periods are great test of whether a nation’s system of checks and balances really works or
paralyzes decision making.

1Q1931
Still, in January 1931, most people confidently expected an imminent recovery. For example, at their January 1931
annual meetings, virtually all bank chairmen predicted a business recovery during 1931. So did politicians,
financiers, businessmen, and even Europeans, who had been the most skeptical of similar predictions in early

1930.84 This is because the problems still seemed manageable, so there was a presumption that there would be
a return to this norm.
February 1931 was a month of mixed economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied sharply during
February as confidence returned. For three weeks prior to Washington’s Birthday, stocks rose and there were
stories of big bears caught short and big M&A deals rumored. International Telephone & Telegraph gained
100% from its January low and there were rumors that it would again attempt to buy Radio Corp’s
communication business. These developments worried investors with cash and shorts that that they’d miss out
on the return to normalcy, so they bought, causing a buying panic. Optimism was pervasive and broadly
expressed. The Dow Jones Industrials rallied 20% from the December low and selected stocks doubled,85 so
there was no doubt that the economy was on the road to recovery.
On stocks, the head of Chase bank commented: “I do not know whether we shall see lower prices in the stock
market or not…There are many securities, both stocks and bonds, which are now selling for less than they will be
worth in normal times and at prices which should prove attractive to the investor.” His conclusion and forecast
were: “I think that we are approximately at the worst of the Depression and that the next important move will be
upward…I expect conditions at the end of 1931 to be a good deal better than they are at the end of 1930.”86 In
January, even Paul Moritz Warburg, who had become somewhat of a respected soothsayer for identifying the
“speculative orgy” just prior to the collapse and who was a well-known banker and a director of the Manhattan
Co., said “from the banker’s point of view, I do not hesitate to say that within a few years hence the level at which
some of our securities sell today will look…incomprehensibly low…even though one might anticipate a year or
two of reduced dividends.”87
Similarly, the President of U.S. Steel, James Augustine Farrell, was quoted in Time magazine saying that stocks
had reached “the low from which an uptrend was now in motion” and the chairman of both RCA and General
Electric, Owen D. Young, stated before the American Bankers Association meeting that in his opinion
improvement was at hand. Numerous leaders within industry echoed these opinions. Also, in February 1931 the
Federal Reserve Board declared that the banking system was much stronger than 18 months earlier. At the same
time, state and local governments were generally considered strong and creditworthy.
Investors shared this view, and the Dow Jones Industrials rallied into February, exceeding the January high as
well as the highs that had been established during both November and December of 1930.88 The chart below
shows the rally and what subsequently happened. Once again, sentiment affected stock prices and the economy,
and knowledgeable people confidently gave misleading advice that sucked people with cash into the market and
shorts out of the market, hurting both. I point this out to show how misleading a consensus of experts and
market movements can be.89

Along with the rally in stocks, railroad bonds rallied in February, exceeding the highs of December 1930 and
January 1931. Corporate and municipal bond defaults started to pick up in 1931.90 Real estate backed bonds were
one of the worst investments, second only to foreign bonds.91 Interestingly, bond defaults caused more losses
than stock market declines in the Depression. In fact, supposedly losses on investments in foreign bonds were
greater than losses on investments in stocks.92 Stocks, at least, could be sold at a price quoted on the exchange.
Bond issues backed by real estate simply went into default and were illiquid.

Wages and Consumer Finance
At this time, there were greatly divergent views about how to solve the Depression. For example, some people
thought that wages should be pushed up and others thought they should fall. For example, the president of the
Chase National Bank, which was the largest bank in the U.S. at the time, Albert Wiggins, said “it is not true that
high wages make prosperity. Instead, prosperity makes high wages. Many industries may reasonably ask labor
to accept a reduction of wages designed to reduce costs and to increase both employment and the buying power
of labor.”93 Others argued that by lowering wages it would reduce the cost of production, thereby reducing retail
prices and stimulating purchases, which would speed recovery.
Naturally, price wars were taking place in many industries as businesses with high fixed capacity wanted to get
any incremental contributions possible, even though these revenues were at a loss.94
Despite interest rates declining, banks did not lend much to individuals because of their perceived credit and
liquidity risks. Credit spreads blew out. The small individual seeking to borrow money was typically forced to
pay over 40% a year! A common practice was that a wage earner’s pay check was postdated. This gave rise to
the often termed “salary-purchasers.” These people offered $50 for a $55 paycheck, taking advantage of the
person who needed the cash immediately. Pawnbrokers were reported to be lending money at the highest
possible legal rate and then forcing the client to pay $10 for $1 worth of merchandise to get around the laws. The
“usurers” would collect $10 a month interest on a $50 loan for years at times. Below is a report showing average
lending rates from various types of lenders to small individuals.95

2Q1931

The Global Dollar Shortage Caused a Global Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar
Because lots of debts were denominated in dollars and the ability to earn dollars fell (because of reduced US
imports), and because the ability to borrow dollars also fell as credit tightened, a global dollar shortage emerged.
Of course, simultaneously there were lots of debts denominated in all currencies that couldn’t be paid, though
dollars were especially short.97
Time magazine reported that the president of the Chase National bank said, “The most serious of the adverse
factors affecting business is the inability to obtain dollars in amounts sufficient both to make interest and
amortization payments on their debts to us and to buy our exports in adequate volume. Cancellation or
reduction of the inter-allied debts has been increasingly discussed throughout the world. This question has an
importance far beyond the dollar magnitude of the debts involved…I am firmly convinced it would be good
business for our Government to initiate a reduction in these debts at this time.”
The battle for world trade continued to lead to more trade barriers. With the trade war going on, foreign nations
were unable to earn enough dollars to make payments on their outstanding loans.98 The effects of the
deleveraging were becoming severe in Canada which was a prominent trading partner. Canada imposed tariffs
so stiff against U.S. Steel that U.S. owners were forced to sell off assets in Canada.99
Fears over the banking situation were as alive in Europe as they were within the United States.100 The Treaty of
Versailles had isolated Germany and Austria, reducing their economic viability significantly. The practices of
“printing” paper money which came about via deficit spending that was monetized created higher rates of
inflation in Europe.101 Germany was saddled with reparation payments it could not make. So, Germany was
forced to borrow dollars in order to meet its obligations, but without a trade surplus it remained a credit risk.
Austria was in no better shape.102 The combined debts of Germany, Austria, Hungary and other Eastern
European nations on a short-term floating basis appeared to slightly exceed $5 billion. This was a figure which
was almost equal to the peak in money which had been lent on call within the stock market back in 1929. This
figure did not include long-term bond issues, war debts or municipal issues which had been floated and held
largely by private investors.103 In other words, these debts were huge.
The small international investor was attracted to German bonds by the favorable carry, but Germany had big
reparations payments so it indirectly sent this money back to the governments of the people it was getting the
money from. Germany couldn’t service its existing debt, most importantly its reparations, so it borrowed the
money to do it. Many of the buyers of German bonds were foreign private citizens who were attracted by the
higher interest rates (6% to 7%); the proceeds were paid to the foreign nations who demanded reparation
payments. It was essentially a Ponzi scheme that transferred the earnings of the small investor into the hands of
the German government through the medium of bonds, which transfers them back to the government that
Germany owed it to. Germany wasn’t really servicing its debts, but as long as this continued, nobody questioned
it. This “Ponzi scheme” approach to servicing debt has, throughout time, commonly existed and, more than any
other factor, caused credit problems.
On May 10, 1931, Germany and Austria signed a free trade agreement that was viewed as antagonistic by the
French. The Bank of France, accompanied by many other French banks, presented short-term Austrian bills for

redemption. This was the final straw which broke the back of the European economic system as repayments
were impossible. Britain came to the aid of Austria, advancing 4.5 million pounds. The French responded by
selling the pound through the liquidation of their sterling holdings, which caused a liquidity crisis, to get back at
Britain.
The liquidity shortage caused bank runs in Austria. On May 13, 1931 riots broke out in front of Austria’s CreditAnstalt bank, which was Austria’s largest bank.104 On May 15, runs were reported throughout Hungary as well.
On May 17, 1931 the Credit-Anstalt published its balance sheet and showed sharply reduced capital because of
operating losses in almost 250 Austrian companies which it controlled.105 This triggered a run on its foreign
deposits which threatened to exhaust Austria’s gold and foreign exchange reserves.106
Similar problems plagued Germany. In June Germany’s central bank, the Reichsbank, saw its reserves of gold
and foreign exchange drop by one-third to the lowest level in five years. In an attempt to attract liquidity at the
end of July, the Reichsbank raised its discount rate to 15% and its rate on collateralized loans to 20%. Bank runs
continued in Germany so the German government took over the Dresdner Bank, the second largest in the nation.
It did this by buying preferred shares, which was the popular way of governments buying interests in banks to
help stabilize them. Sound familiar? Germany’s reserves continued to decline throughout 1931.107
Hoover described the situations as follows: “The nations of Europe have not found peace. Hates and fears
dominate their relations. War injuries have permitted no abatement. The multitude of small democracies
created by The Treaty of Versailles have developed excessive nationalism. They have created a maze of trade
barriers between each other…” The battlefront was forming along the lines of 1) socialism and capitalism within
countries and 2) countries against other countries.108
Running from Europe, investors’ money poured into the U.S., so U.S. interest rates fell. The Fed reduced the
discount rate to 1.5% in hopes of making the dollar less attractive to investors. Britain had been losing gold to the
United States as scared investors fled Britain and Europe in general.109 The Central European states raised their
interest rates in an attempt to attract foreign capital. This was then followed by foreign exchange controls so
investors were not permitted to take money out of the country. This created a drastic side-effect – a halt in
international trade.110 Although no one officially went off the gold standard in May of 1931, since the exportation
of capital was prohibited, no gold payments were made. So this had the same result as abandoning the gold
standard by the Central European states.
Global tensions worsened. In June of 1931, the European press began to attack the United States. They asserted
that the economic policies of the U.S. were attracting the world’s gold, creating the flight from European stock
markets and foreign exchange markets. U.S. gold reserves had climbed by $600 million despite the Fed’s cut in
the discount rate as the flight to safety was too powerful to negate. Despite the deleveraging in the U.S., the U.S.
was viewed by world investors as still the safest place at that point, supported by the dollar shortage, debt
squeeze in Europe, as well as political concerns there.111
As the second quarter of ’31 began, hoarding of gold continued to rise including in the US which contributed to
reducing the velocity rate of money by 22% from the previous year. Gold became very attractive both in physical
form as well as in gold stocks.112

On June 7, the German Finance Minister publicly stated that the Austrian banking crisis would spread to
Germany in about 60 days in his opinion, so the panic began immediately. Virtually every German bank suffered
runs and foreign banks began to pull credit seeking the immediate redemption of German trade bills and bankers’
acceptances.113
On June 19th, in an attempt to ease Germany’s debt problems, President Hoover proposed a one-year
moratorium on Germany’s war debts, catching most political observers by surprise. The international reaction to
the moratorium was favorable. In fact, commentators expected the moratorium was the first step toward
restoring international finances, stimulating trade and ending the Depression. Stocks and commodities rose for
several days in what became known as the “moratorium rally”.114
At the time (i.e., in mid-1931), there still was not a sense of crisis to produce stronger actions by the
administration, as it was generally assumed the economy would recover and that the moves that occurred were
adequate. Financial markets held up reasonably well through June. Governor Harrison of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York thought that the commercial banking system was stronger than ever because of its increased
liquidity. No major industries appeared to be in danger of bankruptcy, and the U.S. economy appeared to be
moving sideways.115
The stock market rose 13% in three weeks in the “moratorium rally” and was up 36% from June 1st at this
point.116 This was the biggest rally since the decline began and commodity prices soared as well, so confidence
again returned.
Within a week of Hoover’s public announcement of his moratorium proposal, 15 governments had agreed with
the plan “unconditionally!” The only important opponent was France who still held bitter resentment toward
Germany. So, many people believed that the international debt problem was being managed.
The chart below puts this rally in perspective. It conveys how seeming very big rallies at the time, and the big
increases in confidence that accompanied them, were rather small when one steps back to put them in
perspective. There was, and still is, a strong tendency for people – workers, investors and policymakers – to
exaggerate the importance of relatively small things because they look big up close.

The international debt crisis continued during the moratorium rally. On July 11th, only five days after the
moratorium was announced, the German government asked the United States to make further loans and to
renegotiate reparations, because short-term investments were still being rapidly withdrawn from Germany. At
the same time, the German stock exchanges were closed for Monday and Tuesday, and on Monday July 13th a
nationwide bank holiday was declared in Germany. The German banking system was in chaos. Banks’ deposits
shrank almost 30% in the year through June 30, 1931 and the unemployment rate soared. The government was
threatened from both the left and the right as Communist riots broke out in many cities and Hitler threatened not
to make German reparations payments.117
National governments were unable to finance their cash requirements in Germany, South America, Sweden,
Hungary, Romania, and the United Kingdom, and virtually every South American country, except Argentina,
defaulted on its foreign debts. Their bond prices dropped to a range between $5 and $25. Eastern Europe did
not default during the year, but the prices of East European external debt issues dropped below $40 in
anticipation of the problems ahead. Economic chaos caused political chaos as the battle for wealth between
workers and capitalists intensified. Almost every country in South America had a problem with revolution, revolt
or war,118 so investors, both from these countries and from elsewhere, moved their money elsewhere.

3Q1931

The Debt Moratorium and the Run on Sterling…
The euphoric “Moratorium Rally” did not last119 because the moratorium obviously didn’t fix the debt problems.
On July 20, 1931, a conference was called in London to discuss the European banking crisis. Hoover’s proposal
was to call a complete “standstill” among all banks everywhere, preventing anyone from calling upon German or
Central European short-term obligations. This didn’t bring comfort to investors who had their wealth stored in
them. A group of New York bankers complained to the White House and warned that they would not comply
with the standstill, which led Hoover to later say, “If [bankers] did not accept within twenty-four hours (his
standstill proposal), I would expose their banking conduct to the American people.” So the bankers reluctantly
backed off.120
English banks had lots of loans to Germany so when Germany couldn’t pay these banks were in trouble.121 So
naturally, investors wanted to take their money and run, so there was a run on England’s reserves. The U.K.
banks then, like the U.K. banks now, were in trouble because they owned lots of debt that was in dollars and not
being paid back and they were losing cash because depositors and creditors were justifiably scared about what
would happen to their money. Then, as now, the Bank of England could only resort to printing money, because
credit from elsewhere was not ample. Seeing these problems, on July 24, 1931, the French began sizable
withdrawals of gold from London. When the French began to withdraw their gold deposits, other nations
followed suit. The Bank of England attempted to stem the run by implementing the typical textbook action of
raising interest rates. Of course this didn’t work.
Then, on August 1, 1931, the Bank of England asked the U.S. government for a loan from private U.S. banks.
Hoover encouraged this action to be taken immediately. But the selling pressure against the pound through the
withdrawals of gold by governments and the selling of the pound by private investors forced the Bank of England
to request an even bigger loan on August 26. Both loans were made, but even this was far from enough to stem
the tide.122 The bank rate was raised from 3 ½% to 4 ½% on July 29.123 Another big loan from US and French
bankers was made on August 28. Note that, through history, the U.K. has always been a preferred country in
getting U.S. loans.
But these loans didn’t stop investors’ run out of sterling. In fact, they essentially helped to fund them by providing
the loans. During July the Bank of England lost nearly one-third of its gold reserves. The Bank of France
supported sterling throughout the week of September 7-12 but Dutch banks began to call their funds heavily
from London to meet their domestic cash needs, as they were being squeezed also.
On September 19 sterling dropped sharply and banks refused to book any speculative short sales of sterling. The
London Stock Exchange was in panic.124 Finally, on Sunday, September 20, 1931, the Bank of England abandoned
the gold standard and effectively defaulted on its foreign obligations. U.K. bonds plunged.125
Sterling fell 31% over next 3 months. On Monday, the first day of trading after the suspension of gold payments,
sterling dropped to a low of $3.71 from the Friday’s level of $4.86. Then, sterling exchange rates fluctuated
widely, from as high as $4.20 to as low as $3.50 during September. As with the earlier described stock market
action, there were plenty of false rallies with bullish sounding developments which easily could have led people
to overlook the big move. Sterling averaged $3.89 in October, $3.72 in November and $3.37 in December.

The Scandinavian countries devalued by a percentage similar to that of the United Kingdom (31%) as did
Portugal, New Zealand, Egypt, and India. Australia devalued by over 40%, Canada by only 17%.
Every foreign bond hit a new low for the period in 1931, and every issue but those for Switzerland and France
declined 20% or more from its 1931 high price, as investors ran from government bonds fearing that they would
either be paid back with devalued paper money or be defaulted on. Bonds of Germany, Austria, and the rest of
Eastern Europe, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, sold off drastically. Austria’s bonds dropped to $35,
Germany’s to $22, Poland’s to $32, Berlin’s to $14 and Yugoslavia’s to $29.126
However, England’s credit was not seriously hurt by the event, though the bond initially sold off. That is because
the devaluation made it easy for the U.K. to pay off U.K. bonds with the pounds the Bank of England could
produce. So on these bonds there was no default risk or a shortage of demand, so the only risk was inflation risk,
but that wasn’t a problem because the devaluation did little more than negate deflation. United Kingdom 5 ½%
bonds due in 1937 dropped to $92 immediately after the devaluation, having been $104 a week prior, but $90
was the low price for 1931 and the bonds were back over $100 by year end. England had been so hampered by an
overvalued currency that the devaluation acted like a tonic. Stocks in the next few months rose up 30%, and by
the end of October the Bank of England repaid $100 million of its foreign debts as money flowed back into
London banks. This is a classic example of how devaluations in deflationary environments create debt relief and
negate deflation rather than rekindle inflation.127 Of course, 30% less in sterling is still 30% so investors
anticipating devaluations want to get into something stable like gold.

Problems Spread to the U.S.
The devaluation of sterling in 1931 sent shock waves through U.S. securities markets that pushed stock prices to
new lows. Some other countries’ stock markets simply stopped trading. For example, the Berlin Bourse closed
from July 13 to September 3, opened with short selling banned, then closed again. In Amsterdam on September
21, after a sharp decline in prices, all transactions were cancelled and the Exchange closed.128 The New York
Stock Exchange remained open, but as in dark November 1929, short selling was forbidden and investors worried,
so risk premiums increased.
The Dow Jones Industrials dropped more sharply than ever before, except for its collapse into November 1929.
The industrials fell below the 100 level and closed September on the low of the month.129 The Dow declined a
further 38% between September 1st and October 5th.130 As October began, the havoc continued, forcing the
industrials down to 86, nearly half the price at the peak of the “moratorium rally” during June 1931. Undoubtedly
a good deal of the fear was of confiscation risk as well as price risk.
The sharp decline in stock prices during September of 1931 was also accompanied by a sharp decline in
production within many industries. Auto production during September fell 25.6% from August levels.131
Commodities prices declined all year. Investors just wanted safety and that pulled cash and credit out of the
hands of consumers and workers.
Banks needed to sell bonds to raise cash, which contributed to rising yields. Yields on long-term U.S. Treasury
bonds rose from 3 ¼% to 4% in the fourth quarter of 1931. Also, there were concerns about U.S. Treasury’s
ability to roll bonds coming due over the next two years as a result of its World War I Liberty Bond financing

maturing.132 There was a $2 billion budget deficit to finance, plus $10 billion in U.S. maturities in 1932-1933. The
U.S. was beginning to look like the U.K. before its devaluation.133
After the sterling crisis there were no further refundings in 1931 because of the weakness of the market. The U.S.
Treasury 4 ¼% bonds due in 1952 dropped from over $114 in June to as low as $102 in October, rose back to
$108 in November and fell down again to $100 in December – all of which was too much volatility for successful
underwriting.134
Despite the fact that the Supreme Court had upheld the legality of shortselling back in 1905, the growing
sentiment was clearly seeking a scapegoat, and stock market bears and Wall Street tycoons became the targets.
They were widely blamed for causing the numerous bank failures and governmental defaults.135 As law suits
mounted and people fought over losses – sometimes in the courts and sometimes in the streets – the Dow Jones
Industrials fell severely as capitalists got scared and sought safety.136

4Q1931

International Crisis Shakes Domestic Markets
The decline in business conditions accelerated sharply after the international crisis as those who controlled
businesses were the capitalists and capital preservation was their primary objective. Bank failures were at record
levels in the last quarter of 1931, and many industries, particularly railroads, began to suffer severe losses. The
Gross National Product dropped 7.7% in constant dollars. Unemployment approached 25% by the end of the
year.137 While National Income had declined by 31% in current dollars from the peak, the income of all
businesses fell 65%. Corporate profits had declined from 10% of National Income to a loss equal to a negative 1
½% of National Income.138
At the time, hardly anyone believed that more and cheaper credit availability would have stimulated business,
because even with interest rates of zero, the real cost of more borrowing was very high and the industries which
needed credit weren’t good credits.139 It was unimaginable then, and comparably implausible to us now, that
banks and other investors will lend to unsound borrowers in a deflation.
In September 1931, the dollar ceased to be a safe haven. Since other countries defaulted and devalued, their
needs for dollars fell and the United States’ budget and credit problems started to raise concerns140 that the U.S.
would have to choose between default and devaluation. So, after the sterling crisis and the U.S. banking crisis
worsened, gold reserves fell, the economy fell, and there was a run on banks.141 U.S. gold reserves increased
right up to the week ending Saturday, September 19, 1931—the day before the United Kingdom decided to
suspend gold payments. The U.S. gold outflow began on the following Monday, when foreign banks, including
the Bank of France, bought almost $100 million in gold from the Federal Reserve. Within three weeks of the
suspension of sterling, the United States lost approximately 10% of its reserves.142 The Fed raised the discount
rate substantially, hoping that higher interest rates would attract investors back.143

To counter the gold outflow, the New York Federal Reserve Bank raised its discount rate from 1 ½% to 2 1/2% on
October 8th, but foreign investors’ concerns had reached the point of not being affected by changes in interest
rates. Rumors abroad that the United States would go off the gold standard as the U.K. did prompted a record
one-day gold outflow on October 14th. The New York Federal Reserve Bank discount rate was raised another 1%
to 3 ½% the next day. The next week, France agreed not to withdraw any more gold from the United States, and
both countries agreed to consult each other before advancing any new proposals for extending the war debts
moratorium.144
However, the supply-demand imbalance for dollars continued to worsen as the Federal government’s deficit
became too big to fund in September 1931, so the Federal Reserve bought U.S. long bonds.145
In mid-October Canada prohibited the exportation of gold , causing investors who tried to protect themselves by
hiding in gold to be trapped.
Besides foreigners withholding gold,146 there was domestic hoarding of gold and currency by U.S. individuals.147
There was a sharp contraction in bank deposits generally during the last quarter of 1931 as foreigners pulled out
and individuals shifted bank deposits into gold and cash hoarding.148 Reflecting this, currency in circulation,
including gold and silver, jumped by about 20% from June 1931 to December.149
The Fed’s tightening to keep capital produced a cash shortage that caused loans to be called. Bankers began to
call in loans from many sectors, trying to increase their cash reserves. Many homes and farms were forced into
foreclosure because their loans weren’t renewed. Company bankruptcies were increased as creditors called in all
the loans to debtors. The contraction in the money supply was not caused by the Federal Reserve intentionally,
but because of the behavior seeking safety via the withdrawal of foreign capital, domestic hoarding, and the
foreclosure on property which further depressed the values of tangible assets.150
The Federal Reserve was given authority to buy U.S. T-bonds in April 1932 so it bought them as deficits increased
and foreign investors withdrew funds. Because of the balance of payments imbalance being financed through the
Fed’s liquidity creation, a currency crisis developed.151
The chart below shows Fed purchases and holdings of government securities from January 1931 to December
1932. As shown, the balance sheet was significantly expanded by this process.

Through the 1920s and up until 1933, the money supply was essentially linked to the supply of gold and, through
the multiplier effect, the supply of money created the supply of credit and that credit growth funded economic
growth. In the 1920s,152 $1 in gold led to $13 in debt as money was lent and relent to create an amount of debt
that was many times the supply of money. Of course, debt is the promise to deliver money, so when this ratio
became high, the system became precariously balanced. When credit starts to fall, usually because there is not
enough money to meet debt obligations, credit falls and the demand for money increases, so the ratio falls.
When the supply of money is linked to the supply of gold, debt must contract more and economic activity must
also fall more than if the supply of money can be increased. When investors lose confidence in a bank or the
government and they hoard their assets (e.g., in cash and gold), as was the case during the Depression, the
hoarding reduces the availability of credit. Since the Fed could not create gold, its only option was to create
paper money. It was then believed that central banks could not create much paper money while on a gold
standard because such a move would revive Gresham’s law of bad money driving out the good.153 If investors
wanted to cash in their US bonds, notes and bills at the same time, the government would be forced to choose
between not increasing the money supply, which would lead to interest rates rising, or printing money. That is
because not enough cash as measured through M1 exists to cover all the debt obligations. Of course, as long as
investors feel comfortable with bonds as a “store of wealth,” and don’t need the cash, everything is fine. But
when confidence in bonds is lost and/or cash is needed, investors run in the direction of cash and gold. There is
simply not enough cash to go around, especially as gold is taken out of reserves, and a massive contraction takes
place. When nations began to default on their bonds and the need of the federal governments to borrow more
than investors would lend, confidence in bonds and government debt maintaining their value gave way, driving
investors into gold and cash for safety. Because debt multiplies the value of these tangible assets, it creates a
bubble which eventually comes to a head creating a stampede into cash. This has been true through history, all
the way back to Roman times and before.154
During August, runs for cash closed most of the banks in Toledo and Omaha and banks in L.A., New York and
Brooklyn. Bank failures accelerated in July and August.155 In the Depression, the bank failures were primarily due
to the declines in corporate bond, stock, real estate, and commodities values, as well as declines in business
generally, which destroyed asset values and income. The weakness of the economy became apparent only in the
summer months, as real estate foreclosures accelerated, wage and salary cuts were initiated in major industries,
and domestic and international trade fell off sharply. Then, as now, real estate was one of the weakest areas of
the economy. Real estate values had collapsed earlier in some regions, particularly in Florida and South Carolina.

This problem spread to New York where there were foreclosures on commercial properties and rental buildings
by savings banks and life insurance companies which produced a rash of foreclosure auctions beginning in June
1931.156 Then, as now, the collapse of real estate values generated increased uneasiness towards the banks. The
bubble in real estate was reflected in real estate loans by national banks doubling from 5% of loans in 1928 to
10% in 1930.157
Because illiquid assets could not be sold to raise liquidity, President Hoover wanted to allow the Federal Reserve
to accept illiquid collateral to lend against.158
On December 10, 1931, Chase securities announced write-downs of $120 million to account for losses in
securities still carried at pre-Crash values. Similar credit problems were pervasive. Banks’ net profits were
reduced from over $556 million in 1929 to $306 million in 1930 to virtually zero in 1931. Securities losses at
banks were a record $264 million in 1931 compared with $109 million in 1930 and $95 million in 1929. Loan
losses were a record $295 million compared with $195 million in 1930 and $140 million in 1929. Interest earned
on loans, bills and commercial paper dropped from $1.6 billion in 1929 to $1.3 billion in 1930 and $1.1 billion 1931.
Then, as now, the banks were squeezed from every direction.159
All sorts of moves were made to hide the real values of assets of banks. Such attempts to hide losses in
deleveragings are typical. For example, laws were changed to preserve the fiction of profits, a moratorium was
declared on removing railroad bonds from the legal investment list in New York State, so that banks did not have
to realize losses on the sale of bonds taken off the “legal list”, and federal authorities allowed banks to carry at
par all U.S. bonds and other bonds within the four highest credit ratings (Baa to Aaa). 160

Hoover’s “Super Plan”
Then, as now, the administration started to exert pressure on the banks to lend. Hoover’s “Super Plan” to do this
created what was known as the National Credit Corporation. Hoover realized that vast sums of assets were
frozen and that, combined with international investors’ capital withdrawals, this spelled potential international
disaster, so his idea was to create another form of central bank in a sense. The National Credit Corporation
would be a private organization funded by $500 million in deposit contributions from the banks themselves. In
turn, these funds would be used to bail out banks with cash flow problems by lending them cash against good
collateral held on their books. He believed that this was essential to bring a halt to the bank failures and the
foreclosures which further increased fears among the people and led to domestic hoarding of gold.
Hoover’s plan began to gel prior to the British default of September 21, 1931. At a confidential meeting during
early September, Hoover called to the White House the entire Advisor Council of the Federal Reserve Board
members, which consisted of 24 bankers and Treasury officials, and proposed that the banks pool together $500
million for the creation of this new project. In addition, he proposed that this new pool be given borrowing
powers of $1 billion, thus allowing them to buy a substantial amount of illiquid assets to take them off banks’
balance sheets.
Then the British default took place. Suddenly the gold reserves of the U.S. fell. Eleven days later, Hoover called a
special meeting of the leading men from the banks, insurance and loan agencies along with several top
government officials. Hoover wanted to avoid publicity on this meeting, so the meeting took place on October 4,
at the home of Andrew Mellon rather than at the White House.161 Hoover later wrote that many attending the
meeting held at Mellon’s house did not want to contribute funds to this central pool and urged that the

government should put up the money. But Hoover was strongly against using taxpayer’s money, so the meeting
ended with the bankers agreeing to call a meeting of all major New York banks for the following day.
Hoover had also proposed that banks and insurance companies hold back on foreclosures and that a central
system of discounting mortgages should be established. Again, the concept was a central bank which would
accept mortgages in the same manner as the Fed accepts cash or liquid notes. Basically this is what the Fed is
doing now. The savings and loan group agreed with Hoover’s proposals which called for an immediate end to
foreclosures upon responsible people. The insurance industry refused to go along with the proposed banking
structure which would have 12 districts and accept mortgages as deposits.
Hoover then met with Congressional leaders at the White House on October 6. He found them unwilling to use
tax payer money to fund any government structure to provide stability for the real estate situation.162 Hoover
then created the Home Loan Banks which stood in the middle of the savings and loans. He also created the
National Credit Corporation, which further helped confidence in banks.
News of these new plans restored confidence both domestically and internationally. But at first, the Europeans
misunderstood these proposals and assumed they would be funded by government, which they felt meant
inflation and a decline in U.S. gold reserves. Therefore, initially, this news added some pressure to the dollar
coming from Europe. Eventually, they understood the plan and fears that the United States would go into default
on its commitment to deliver gold began to subside along with the gold withdrawals going into year end. The
concept of this new form of centralized private banking to unlock frozen capital and to help prevent further
banking failures was well received by the markets as well.163 The low in the U.S. gold reserves had been reached
during the final week in October and it rose steadily throughout November. Stocks also rallied. Everyone
became bullish and even the famous investor Roger Babson, who called the stock market’s top in 1929, ran a
small ad with its headline “Is Bear Market Over?”164
The Dow rose 35% from early October to early November. Most of the rebound was concentrated in the week of
October 5th-10th, during which President Hoover announced his proposals for a National Credit Corporation and
various other provisions to ease the banking crisis. But, like other failed rallies on bullish announcements, this
rally failed when the proposals proved too small for the problem.165 Stocks declined sharply, taking the Dow
down to a new low of 74 in late December. That brought the leading stock averages down to only one-third of
their 1931 highs and one-sixth of their 1929 highs. The only important nations which remained on the gold
standard were the US and France.

1H1932
In spite of the National Credit Corporation, bank failures were still hitting the papers almost daily. The
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was the TARP program of the time, was proposed to Congress
by President Hoover in December 1931 and signed into law on January 23, 1932,166 with authority to spend $1.5
billion. Largely as a result of all this support for banks and others, the Dow rallied from that December 1931 low
of 73 to nearly 86 in early January which was about a 19% gain, but finished January back down at the 76 level.167
The tensions between workers and capitalists intensified in 1932. In 1932 there were demonstrations in
Washington and politicians turned their sights on the investment community as a whole. Some politicians
accused the banks of intentionally trying to destroy the economy of the world in an effort to force the United
States to cancel the outstanding war debts of Europe so that normal commercial debts could be settled with the

banks. Some politicians supported the total abolition of the stock market while others urged that the shorts
could be exposed and jailed as if their actions rose to the level of treason.168 The proletariat and politicians
turned on capitalists and investors.
The fiscal 1932 budget deficit grew because revenues were cut in half between fiscal 1929 and fiscal 1932, while
federal budget expenditures grew by half. Believing that a budget deficit could lead the U.S. to default, the
administration began to push for tax increases and expenditure cuts.169 Everyone wanted a balanced budget
back then. Business support for a balanced budget was almost universal. The American Bankers Association
and the Investment Bankers Association predictably passed resolution at their conventions early in the year
favoring higher taxes and lower expenditures to balance the budget. Political support for a balanced budget was
broadly bipartisan.170
In January 1932, the Comptroller of the Currency abandoned mark to market accounting for banks. Bank
examiners were instructed to use par value as the “intrinsic value” of bonds rated Baa or better held by national
banks.171 The Comptroller of the Currency also issued a demand to all national banks that they report on what
bonds they were holding. Even good bonds had been devastated so banks either faced huger paper losses on
what they held, or suffered actual cash losses if they sold.172
Optimism returned in mid-February when the RFC began to make loans to banks and railroads and when
Congress passed an amendment to the Federal Reserve statute permitting the Federal Reserve banks to hold US
government bonds, as well as gold, as cover for Federal Reserve obligations so the Federal Reserve System was
freed to pursue an aggressive open market policy of purchasing government securities without being constrained
by the loss of gold to foreigners expected to follow such an “inflationary” policy. So, the Dow Jones Industrial
Index jumped by 19.5%.173 The stock market immediately rallied back to the January high and managed to close
above the 80 level.
On February 11, Hoover managed to obtain cooperation from all parties to usher through the Glass-Steagall bill,
which broadened the scope of debt that was eligible for rediscounting at the Federal Reserve. Broadening the
scope of collateral that can be discounted at the central bank is a classic step in the D-process. This was
perceived as bullish as it was felt that this would help many banks to unfreeze assets that were previously
unacceptable as collateral at the Fed. The bill was signed by Hoover on February 27.174
At the time, the Senate Finance Committee conducted hearings into international banking and war debts. It
sought a complete list of all foreign bond issues which were currently in default. That information was obtained
from the Institute of International Finance. The Senate made that list public in January 1932. The list totaled
$815 million worth of foreign bonds denominated in dollars with defaults covering 57 issues, with all being
obligations of South American governments. The majority of the junk bonds were held by small investors who
had been lured into buying them by numerous advertising campaigns which touted bonds as the “safe”
investment and offered high yields.175
Investor fears intensified, so in Europe and the U.S., the hoarding of U.S. $20 gold coins increased, with the
premium rising to 50% - i.e., the price rose to as much as $30.
Japanese bonds and the yen had collapsed. Japan had abandoned the gold standard a few months before, so the
yen fell from the par level of 49.84 cents to 35 cents. As a result, Japanese bonds denominated in dollars

collapsed from 100 to 61. The total U.S. investment in Japan was reported to be $450 million, of which $390
million was Japanese bonds. But Japan’s gold reserves had dropped to only $190 million which represented half
of the outstanding debt to the United States alone, so it wasn’t difficult to figure out that Japan would default on
its obligations to pay its debts in gold.
Throughout history the French have always been among the first to hoard gold in a crisis and the French
government was always the first to ask for gold during a monetary breakdown – e.g., in 1968 when DeGaulle
asked for gold instead of dollars from the U.S., etc. The French people are the same, so they caused the French
government problems by asking the French government for gold. To avoid demand from the French public, the
French government stated that it would only make gold payments in $8,000 lot minimums. As a result, gold
coins were in very high demand. In the United States, many contracts began to be issued in terms which
required payment in gold coin. While gold was rising in street value, other commodities continued to decline.
That reflected decreasing confidence in holding debt, including government debt, during a deleveraging when the
demand for commodities is weak.176

In February, the business failures were the highest on record for any month.177
In March, the stock market sold off again as expectations that the Fed’s move to reliquify were disappointed. The
market decline began in March and extended for 11 weeks until the Dow had dropped from 88 on March 8th to 44
on May 31st, a decline of 50%. This stock market decline occurred while the Federal Reserve was following an
unprecedented open market policy of expanding its holdings of U.S. government securities from $740 million at
the end of February 1932 to $1.8 billion at the end of July.178
The British pound, which had fallen from the par value of April 1931 before the devaluation, began to fall again,
dropping to $3.65 from its March high of $3.77. The downtrend would eventually continue into November of
1932 when the pound dropped to $3.15. Only the French and the Swiss currencies remained steady.179
Trading volume on the NYSE during April had declined to 31.4 million shares. This was the first panic sell off
where new lows were achieved on lower volume. The Dow Jones Industrials fell almost continuously straight
down, closing May on the low for the month. Yet volume declined considerably. The lower volume reflected

lower investor participation as they had essentially given up on it. Big sell-offs on low volume late in a bear
market are a good sign of exhaustion. On a percentage basis, the market decline was about equal to the panic of
1907 and that of the panic of 1920.180
Hoover tried to but couldn’t get credit going. Hoover and Treasury Secretary Mills regularly blamed the banks
for restricting loans and condemned both the public and the banks for hoarding.181 Hoover tried to get the banks
to lend, but couldn’t. For example, Hoover organized committees of prominent citizens in all Federal Reserve
districts to try to encourage the larger regional banks to make loans.182 During May 1932, Hoover requested a
doubling in the RFC authorization to $3 billion, of which $300 million was earmarked for aid to local
governments.183 But nothing was adequate.
Back then, the Fed didn’t handle failed banks, so they were turned over to the RFC. The government didn’t have
the administrative resources to handle all of these problems.184
Like TARP, the RFC lent to financial institutions. In fact, the relationship with the Bank of America then and the
Bank of America now is basically the same. In 1932, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation prevented bank
closings from being more numerous by lending $1.3 billion by the end of August 1932 to 5,520 financial
institutions, which included its first loan to the Bank of America for $15 million, which it ultimately expanded to
$64.5 million, and the Federal Reserve continued to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve System’s
holdings of U.S. government securities expanded from $870 million on March 31, 1932, to $1784 million by June
30.185
Then, like now, the RFC (the TARP equivalent) and the Fed made loans directly to borrowers who couldn’t roll
debt, while letting others default. They felt compelled to do this because the banks were unwilling to lend even
to borrowers facing bond maturities. The intense desire for liquidity created such competition for short-term
government securities that Treasury bill yields were negative in much of October, November and December.186
The decline in short-term interest rates was also driven by aggressive Fed buying of T-bills. Between April and
August 1932, the Federal Reserve instituted an unprecedented open-market purchase program in an effort to
create bank liquidity. This helped. The 11 months following January had fewer suspensions than either 1930 or
1931. Federal Reserve borrowing was relatively low for banks in major cities during 1932, and these banks’
investments were stable, which also gave the impression that the emergency in banking conditions had passed.
The effect on money market rates was dramatic. 3-to-6-month Treasury securities yields dropped 180 basis
points from 2.25% to 0.30% in eight weeks once the Federal Reserve began its purchases.187
Interestingly, the market reactions to government moves began to change. While previously government
programs to increase lending and spending were viewed by the market optimistically, in mid-1932 they did not
produce optimism.188 It was then apparent that Hoover had established many programs to stimulate lending,
spending and job creation, but they did not have the desired effect, yet they cost a lot of money. In fact, some
government attempts to help banks hurt them. For example, the RFC lending to some banks saved them from
bankruptcy, but the banks gave all their good assets to the RFC as collateral. A J.P. Morgan & Co. partner
described this dynamic as follows: “For a fatal year and a half the RFC continued to lend money to the banks on
adequate collateral security and gradually bankrupted them in the effort to save them.” The RFC made large
loans to banks on the collateral of real estate loans and securities that many considered to be of questionable
value, but the RFC still had to make these loans based on some estimate of the fair market value of the collateral
and with some margin of surplus collateral. These collateral values were well below the banks’ book values in the

securities. As a result, the borrowing banks found they had pledged all but their worst assets to the Federal
Reserve and to the RFC at a discount from the par values and could only get back a portion of their deposits.
Many banks would have had their net worth effectively wiped out if all their assets, securities, and loans had to
be written down to the low values of mid-1932. This is essentially what happened when the RFC calculated how
much it could lend a bank. This failure to make the banks healthy became apparent, so banks’ deposits dropped
further than could be borrowed from the RFC after it had sold its highly liquid securities, so the bank had no more
good assets on which to borrow elsewhere.189
Borrowing from the RFC also signified a bank was in need, which led to withdrawals. There was a vicious circle in
progress for the banks which borrowed from the RFC. Directors, officers, other banks, and often major
customers were aware of a borrowing bank’s problems, and this information circulated in the business
community and naturally caused large depositors to be cautious about the size of deposits they left with the
bank, so they pulled them.190 So, if word got out that a bank was borrowing from the RFC its condition was
immediately suspect and runs on its deposits began.191
Because the banks wanted to hoard cash to keep safe and because they didn’t want to lend to borrowers who
weren’t creditworthy, the banks did not want to roll over many maturing debts. Railroads were in trouble of their
large revenue and income losses, so they were unable to pay the $300-$400 million in bond maturities that
came due in 1932.192 But the government wanted the banks to rollover these debts, so the government via the
RFC and the ICC mandated that railroad bonds (heavily owned by the banking
system) maturing in 1932 should not be paid off in cash lent by the RFC, but rather should be settled by a
combination of cash and refunding bonds which lenders had no choice but to accept.193 Needless to say, this
further undermined the confidence of investors in their abilities to get cash from their investments and in the
legal system protecting their rights.
In March 1932 suspicion led the U.S. Senate to authorize an investigation into securities practices which
ultimately led to the massive legal and structural changes in the securities industry embodied in the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.194 The government
investigation of stock manipulation was like a witch hunt.195 Understandably there was a lot of congressional
digging that turned up abuses. However, this went beyond reasonable.
Congress had problems making decisions as conflicting factions argued endlessly. For example, the fiscal 1933
budget was debated in Congress from March through June while Hoover gave little guidance on the budget cuts
necessary, trying to place the onus for them on Congress in this election year. Foreign investor reaction to both
the anti-investor mood and the indecision in government was negative and contributed to capital flight, which
was clearly expressed in U.S. gold losses throughout the period.196
The Federal Government had a big budget deficit and the pending tax bill seemed to be going nowhere.
Meanwhile, spending increased as Hoover sought to create jobs for the unemployed. The billions of dollars being
spent in recovery attempts without any plan for paying for them scared European investors, so gold outflows
began to increase.197
Back then it was a popular technique of the government to package spending as loans – i.e., to create “loans” to
entities which spent which allowed the government to keep the loans on its books as assets. For example, if the

government made a loan to a bank, it could treat that as an exchange of one asset for another rather than an
expense. This technique made the budget deficit look smaller than if the same money was provided as
assistance. So, the government promoted loan programs outside the budget, particularly for the RFC. Of course,
the impact of these loan programs on government financing requirements was no different than if the programs
were government spending,198 so the supply demand imbalance for government credit remained.
At this time there was a move to redistribute wealth. Although governments would stop short of full blown
communism, laws progressively were intended to redistribute wealth. For example, the gradated income tax rate
eventually rose to 90%199 and the budget deficit ballooned (see below).200

In Europe, concerns about the deficit and the inhospitable environment in the United States sparked heavy
withdrawals of gold by European investors. Within the first ten days in June, $152 million in gold bullion had
been withdrawn. On June 6, 1932, President Hoover signed into law the new Revenue Act, which increased
income taxes and corporation taxes along with a variety of excise taxes. On June 14, 1932, France withdrew her
last gold which was held on deposit at the NY Federal Reserve.201
The Federal Reserve publicly reassured the public that it intended to continue buying U.S. governments in order
to fund the deficit and hold interest rates down. Of course, this was incompatible with the stable exchange rate
policy. So, despite these assurances, purchases of bonds finally came to a halt in August, after which the Federal
Reserve holdings of U.S. securities remained very stable at $1,850 million. That year net new U.S. borrowing in
1932 exceeded $3 billion, the federal budget deficit exceeded $2.5 billion, and the deficit was over one-half of
federal expenditures.
On June 16 in Switzerland, a group of seven nations met and finally agreed at Lausanne to reduce the German
reparations payments from $64 billion to less than $1 billion.

2H1932
The economy continued to plunge with deflation. Broad measures of the economy in 1932 had dropped to about
50% of their 1929 levels in current dollar terms, though if expressed in constant dollars the decline was
approximately 28% from 1929. There were a record 31,822 bankruptcies, with liabilities of $928 million. Though
these were painful, they reduced debt service obligations, thus helping to fix the debt service imbalance. Industry
as a whole had an after-tax loss of $2.7 billion in 1932, compared with its peak profits of $8.6 billion in 1929,
forcing drastic cost-cutting, reducing their breakeven levels.202 Through this painful process, those businesses
that survived became leaner and meaner.

At the same time, workers became militant, which scared investors. Unemployment averaged 36.3% for nonfarm workers during 1932. During July of 1932, 11,000 veterans marched on Washington, demanding immediate
cash payment of the soldier’s bonus instead of spreading it out over several years.
The atmosphere of unrest, if not revolution, unsettled investors, businessmen and politicians, especially as
socialism and communism were becoming more popular.203
Economic conditions were miserable. In New York, most of the major hotels were in default. Tax arrears in New
York City reached 26%. Conditions were even worse than in the farm areas, where drought and low prices
combined to bankrupt farmers. Problems in the banking system dominated short-term money markets in
1932.204 This crisis virtually halted bank lending in the second half of 1932, as banks wanted to conserve cash
and could not lend prudently.205
The great New York City banks had become the liquidity reserve for the rest of the financial system.
Corporations and institutions which feared that their deposits would be tied up in closed domestic banks
transferred deposits to New York. Regional banks built up their liquid assets by increasing interbank deposits
with New York, so when the outflow from New York banks occurred it essentially represented the end of
capitalism as we know it. In July 1932, it seemed as though the capitalist system had shut down, government
was paralyzed and anarchy was brewing.206
On an otherwise un-eventful Friday – July 8, 1932 – the stock market bottomed.207 Going into its final low,
volume was very low. Most of the speculative positions had been wiped out by that time. Understandably, risk
premiums were extremely high.208
The lowest point for commodities prices was during the liquidity crisis in May and June, which was also the low
point for stock and bond prices and for the economy. Interestingly, as the liquidity crisis worsened, stock and
bond markets strengthened in the second half of 1932.209 The corporate bond market recovered in the third
quarter as quickly as it had declined in the second quarter, in line with improvement in the stock market and
modest recovery in the economy.210 The Dow recovered in August and September to a peak of 80, which was
almost double the low hit in July (see below).211

During 1932, arguments over the war debts and reparations created a problem for confidence. As the December
1932 payment date approached, England and France petitioned the United States for a further extension of the
moratorium on payments. The moratorium was not extended, so in December, France, Belgium, Hungary and
Poland defaulted on their war debts. England paid its installment, as due, in gold.
The situation in Germany was much worse. The policies of government had forced on Germany a severe
deflation, which by the fall of 1932 had cut the standard of living by nearly 50%. As a result, political and social
conflicts intensified. Polarity increased, and Communistic and Hitlerist groups gained popularity.212 There were
regular weekend street riots between Nazis and Communists in which deaths were frequent. In July, the Reich
took over the government of Prussia and declared a state of emergency in Berlin, in September the military
pushed the Republic to request the right to rearm, and the country’s finances appeared to be collapsing. German
gold reserves continued to decline.213 These circumstances led to Hitler’s victory in 1932.
Japan also became militaristic and invaded Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932. Domestic and international
conflicts increased around the world.214
There were opportunities in 1932 to make significant profits from the price movements in middle grade bonds.
For example, Australia’s bonds rose over 150% from their lowest 1931 price of $35; Finland’s bonds doubled in
price from a low of $34 in 1931 to a high of $68 in 1932; bonds of Argentina rose 92 1/2% from their 1931 low
price; Japan’s rose by 72%; and Czechoslovakia’s rose by approximately 50%. Investors could have tripled their
money in the bonds of Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay, Yugoslavia, and Berlin between their low and high prices for
1931-32. Chile’s bonds traded between $15 and $3 ½, Peru’s between $10 and $3, Bolivia’s between $10 and $3
¼.215
Western Europe’s bonds recovered from the 1931 currency crisis, and the yields on the best bonds declined to
nearly as low as Aaa corporate bond yields. However, East European and South American bonds hit new low
prices in 1932 as these parts of the world suffered such social and economic dislocations that even the most
daring speculators were unwilling to bet on these bonds.216

The gold drain also stopped, and foreign funds began to return to the United States. Foreign optimism improved
considerably, especially in England, Germany, France and Australia. A League of Nations survey on the world
economy found cautious optimism in most countries.
Why did the stock market bottom in early July? There was not much big news to bring it about. On July 2,
Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated at the Democratic National Convention, but this was no great surprise. The
Wall Street Journal attributed the rally to a cessation of gold outflows, rumors of foreign buying, a general rise in
commodity prices, and the approval of a railroad merger. Time magazine pointed to the rally in commodities,
which was the single biggest jump in across the board commodities since 1925, but the commodities eventually
fell to new lows in November though the stock market held the July lows and never violated the 50 area again.
Short covering was clearly a factor behind this bull move. Cornered bears, fat with three years of profits, fought
madly to cover their short positions. Much of the buying flowed from Europe into the States, which also pushed
the dollar higher. European buying of U.S. securities, which was reported from many sources in July, was largely
driven by a hedge against a fear of further devaluations of European currencies.
In August 1932, the CCC decided to lend on the collateral of raw materials. The Commodity Credit Corporation
was set up by New York City banks in August 1932 at the urging of the then Federal Reserve Board Chairman,
Eugene Meyer, to lend on the collateral of raw materials.
There was also a strong corporate bond market rally, despite worsening economic conditions.
Roosevelt was elected amid widespread brokerage commentary that his success would halt the economic
recovery and provoke a new crisis in securities markets. The Federal Reserve halted its open market purchases
after August. Bank problems were obviously accelerating as well. New York City suddenly plunged into a major
crisis. The news was bad. The old adage that when a market declines on bullish news, it must mean that it’s a
bear market and, conversely, when a market rallies on bearish news, it must be a bull market, proved true.
Roosevelt’s campaign for the Presidency began in August with a strong anti-market tone, which added to the
volatility of the market. Franklin Roosevelt opened his campaign with a nine-point speech focused solely on
securities abuses and demanding federal control of stock and commodities exchanges. He criticized the Hoover
Administration for the activities of 1929, for the activities of bank investment affiliates, for Federal Reserve
policies, for foreign bond issues, and for stock market speculation.217
Roosevelt also indicated that he favored a devaluation of the dollar.
Europeans began to sell the dollar dramatically when Roosevelt won the election, because he represented soft
money to them.

The stock market did not recover during the rest of the year because fear of Roosevelt’s success was widespread
up to the November 8th election, and the reality of it did not engender investor confidence.
But to the average working man this election was reason for optimism. The Republicans were marked as the
party for the rich and the Democrats emerged as the defender of the poor and working class. So while capitalists
were scared, workers were hopeful.
On the eve before the elections, pressure from many sectors demanded that Roosevelt clarify his position about
devaluation. He did. He pledged that he would not abandon the gold standard and conveyed that concerns he
would devalue were not warranted. He was not the first nor the last government official to knowingly mislead
the public regarding their willingness to support their currencies.
Though very painful, the deleveraging was not devastating for everyone. Throughout the deleveraging, major
companies except for railroads and investment companies didn’t default. Numerous industries did not have
losses, and several even maintained their profit levels. Cigarette companies, can manufacturers, food, drug,
grocery and variety store companies, and utilities all kept their net income at levels up to half their 1929 levels.
In contrast, bonds of East European and South American governments fell to approximately 10% of par value.
Many railroad bonds, too, had great losses, but among the major issues which lost their top credit ratings the
decline was to approximately 40% of par. Only a small proportion of municipal bonds went into default.

1933
Upon Roosevelt’s winning the election, rumors began to spread that a devaluation was in the works. The
Democratic party had long been a symbol of “soft money,” going back to the 1890s when they were known as the
“Silver Democrats” with William Jennings Bryan’s famous speech of “Thou shalt not crucify mankind upon a
cross of gold.” And Roosevelt’s campaign rhetoric encouraged these rumors.218
A devaluation would help workers by raising wages, but it would hurt debtholders as the value of their securities
was tied to the value of money. So, investors fled, and in January, there were big gold withdrawals. Foreign
banks began to redeem their dollars for gold, further increasing the drain upon reserves, and the withdrawal of
gold coin from the Treasury was approaching a crisis level as private investors also sought to convert their bonds
into gold.219
On the 18th of February, a Senator who had publicly accepted the post of Secretary of the Treasury under
Roosevelt announced that he had refused the post because upon meeting with Mr. Roosevelt, the President-elect
would not provide the Senator with an assurance that the gold standard would be maintained. The New York
Times wrote “…at no time in the recent economic history of America has there been greater need than at present
for a flat declaration of a monetary policy by the new American government. A declaration by Mr. Roosevelt
declaring firm resolution to maintain a sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect.” He did not
reply with these assurances, which raised concerns.220
Between November 1932 and March 1933, there was clearly an anticipation of possible reflationary policies of
the President-elect which caused a flight from the dollar, which sparked numerous Europeans to dump their
holdings, and which in turn forced the Dow Jones Industrials down from 62 to 50 moving into February 1933.
Investor hoarding of gold and foreign investors leaving the U.S. hastened the banking liquidity crisis.

In reaction to this flight from the dollar and from the U.S., Hoover wanted capital export controls.221 Foreign
exchange controls are quite normal in situations like this and very scary for investors. To justify his ability to do
this, Hoover attempted to use the War Powers, but the Democrats blocked this move,222 which is interesting as
typically left of center governments are in favor of capital controls and right of center governments are against
them. The panic out of the U.S. accelerated from a slow pace to a stampede. Specifically, the gold stock declined
slowly at first, from $4,279 million on January 18, 1933, to $4,224 million on February 15, 1933. It dropped a
further $168 million by March 1st, another $100 million by March 3rd, and reports circulated that over $700
million would be presented for gold on March 4th, the day of Roosevelt’s inauguration.223
From the November low of $3.15 when Roosevelt was elected, the pound jumped to $3.43 by February just
before this inauguration for an 11.25% gain. The smart money in the United States was buying foreign exchange
while the masses were hoarding gold in ever increasing quantities. In the end, those who had bought the foreign
exchange profited, while those who hoarded gold in the U.S. found themselves trapped, i.e. if they did not
surrender their gold hoardings at the old value of $20 prior to Roosevelt’s devaluation in January 1934224 they
were subject to criminal prosecution. It wasn’t easy being an investor or a capitalist in those days. Business
activity hit a low point in March 1933. In 1933, the Gross National Product reached its lowest point in the
Depression at $55.6 billion, or 46% below 1929. In constant dollars this was 31 ½% below 1929.225
When the banks closed in many states during February and March, many businesses closed completely. The
resulting low level of business activity in February and March 1933 was shocking.226

March 1933

Roosevelt Assumes Office and Declares a Banking Moratorium
and Other Policies in His First 100 Days
Roosevelt’s Inauguration speech can be found in Appendix 1.
When Roosevelt assumed office on March 4, he declared a banking moratorium enacting the War Powers Act
(which he had helped prevent Hoover from using), and he let the dollar slide.227 The stock market and the banks
remained closed.
The reflation worked! By then, rents and debt service obligations and equity levels had been substantially
reduced, so it took less stimulation to raise cash flows above debt payments. From 1929 to 1933, the
bankruptcies and other forms of restructuring had reduced the debt by about 21% and financial wealth by about
30%. The deleveraging had also substantially reduced businesses’ operating costs and break even levels, so it
took less revenue growth than before to make them profitable. Furthermore, it increased risk premiums of
investment assets to very high levels. So, reflation via currency devaluation and increased liquidity raised
commodity and export prices and lowered real yields (making cash unattractive). Additionally, the inability to
buy gold or move money out of the country made stocks relatively attractive. In the September 25, 1933 edition
of Time magazine, the moves of capitalists to protect their wealth in this environment were described as follows:
“Methods of hedging against inflation within U.S. frontiers have become a favorite coffee and cognac topic.
Purchase of industrial stocks is, of course, the most popular hedge, but commodities and land have been creeping
up fast since the NRA threatened profits with higher labor costs. Some shrewd businessmen with little capital at
stake argue that the best thing is to go as deep into debt as the banks (or friends) will allow; eventually they will

pay off with cheaper dollars.” The market action was great. Also, there was significantly increased government
spending that helped.
Stock, bond, and commodities prices rose dramatically throughout March following the Bank Holiday. Moody’s
daily index of staple commodities actually rose 6% from Friday, March 3rd, to Tuesday, March 7th. The stock
market reopened on March 15th. It was initially near the 62 level, but fell back to 56 for the end of the month.228
The U.S. Treasury offered two new bond issues on March 13th – $400 million due August totaling $1.8 billion.
Interestingly, after the dollar devaluation, the gold outflow was reversed, and the United States gained over $325
million in gold in the week ending March 15th. Bank borrowing at the Federal Reserve dropped $180 million in
the same week as banks got more cash. During the next two weeks, short-term rates dropped 1%-2% as cash
returned, and Fed policy remained easy. Bankers’ acceptance rates fell back to 2%, and call loan rates fell to 3%,
as the Federal Reserve cut its buying rate for 90-day acceptances 3 times within five days.229
The first batch of charts below shows various measures of economic activity and prices. They all convey the ‘V’
bottom that occurred at the moment when the Fed substantially increased liquidity (which necessitated the
dollar’s devaluation against gold and other currencies).

As mentioned before, largely as a result of the dollar becoming overvalued and the credit crisis in the U.S., capital
started to shift out of the U.S. and the dollar, forcing the U.S. to choose between tightening and devaluing. The
next couple of charts show the Fed’s tightening and associated interest rate changes that occurred in 1928 - 29
and in 1931-33 (until the devaluation).

The next batch of charts focuses in on 1932 - 34 – i.e., to squint at this period, we zoomed in on it (showing
monthly numbers). The first chart shows the dollar, gold, and the government short rate. Note in the first chart
how the government short rate shot up going into the devaluation (because of the currency defense), as money
was being withdrawn from banks and from the U.S., and then how a) the bank “holiday”, b) gold exports being
disallowed, and c) the devaluation occurred together. When the banks opened their doors, everyone could get
their money because it was provided freely. In other words, liquidity was increased to help alleviate the debt
crisis. Interest rates continued to fall while stocks, the economy, commodity prices, and inflation all rose from
1933 to 1937, which was the same as during other post-liquidity squeeze periods (e.g. post ERM break-up and
post 1980).

Once in power, Roosevelt used the RFC’s powers actively. The array of financial institutions which had been
forced to rely on the RFC was staggering up until then, e.g., by December 31, 1932, loans had been authorized to
5,582 banks, 877 savings banks, 101 insurance companies, 85 mortgage loan companies, and 3 credit unions – a
total of 6,648 institutions – for a total commitment by the RFC of over $1.25 billion. An additional $333 million
had been committed to 62 railroads which were borrowing heavily from the banks. But this was small potatoes
in relation to what was to come.230
A Glass-Steagall II was passed, and it provided a federal government guarantee on all bank deposits up to
$2500, eliminated interest on demand deposits, set margin limits on loans to carry securities, set the limit that
one bank could lend to one creditor at 10% of the bank’s capital, and split commercial banking and investment
banking functions into two industries.231
Also, The National Industrial Recovery Act was passed, which was based on many of the ideas of Bernard
Baruch, who had become one of Roosevelt’s financial advisors. The act authorized $3.3 billion in public works.
Also, the Home Owners Loan Act provided a federal guarantee to refinance mortgages on homes costing less
than $20,000. The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided for the withdrawal of farm land under production in
return for federal cash payments, 4 ½% refinancing of farm mortgages, and a promise of farm product price
supports at a minimum of production cost. The Act also provided numerous measures to promote credit
expansion, including presidential authority to devalue the gold content of the dollar by up to 60%.232 A special
Sunday night session of Congress was called to consider the Emergency Banking Act, which authorized the RFC
to borrow without limit and to buy preferred stock in closed banks without collateral to help them reopen. The
act allowed bank notes to be issued up to 90% of collateral and the Federal Reserve to make loans against any
collateral. When banks were reopened, government influence over the financial markets was established, and
rescue missions were put in place by the RFC. 233At the end of March, the RFC announced hurriedly prepared
regulations governing RFC purchases of preferred stock in closed banks in order to help them reopen , and by the
end of June 1933 made preferred stock purchases or loans.234

President Roosevelt announced the end of the gold standard on April 22nd. All those who failed to turn their
gold into the Federal Reserve were subject to a maximum fine of $10,000 plus ten years in jail. 235 President
Roosevelt issued an executive order, under power given him by Congress in the emergency banking act, ordering
all holders of gold to turn it in to the government by May 1 or take the penalty. In May, when interest on U.S. gold
bonds was due, which meant that interest to be paid in gold, not paper, Roosevelt broke the “covenant” as
payment in paper dollars was mandated.236
In June the new Securities Act of 1933 came into being. It stated that if any “material” fact is misstated or if any
“material” fact is omitted, each director is held personally liable for the loss incurred by a buyer of the security.
The Securities Act also required registration of all new securities offerings with the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), with the exception of local government issues, bank deposits, and commercial paper. The securities
industry complained about the Securities Act, principally because it established criminal and civil liability for all
participants in an issue for all facets of it for up to two years after the discovery of any untrue statement or
omission in the prospectus, or up to ten years after the date of issue.237
Going off the gold standard caused stocks and commodities to soar. During early June, the meaning of the news
about gold, the dollar, and foreign exchange controls finally hit home. The President was not going to cut the
gold content of the dollar as expected, but he was going to eliminate the gold clause from public and private
contracts.238 So with gold completely out of the picture as a store of wealth at any price in the U.S., the choice
was to move money abroad or into something tangible in an environment of the falling value of money.239
Investors wanted something tangible so they bought stocks which shot prices to the best levels in two years.
Similarly, commodities rallied to their highest level since the inflation boom began. This type of market action is
consistent with currency devaluation because, when the value of money declines, most things measured in it rise,
and devaluations raise incomes because of price increases and improved export sales.
Stock multiples exploded as risk premiums fell. For example, stock prices for companies with meaningful
earnings averaged 22.7 times 1933 earnings per share, compared with 10 times 1933 earnings in February, before
Roosevelt’s inauguration. Stocks at their highest prices went back to 85% of their 1929 low prices.240
Economic conditions improved dramatically in just a few months, and securities and commodities prices quickly
doubled. Business activity rose to 89.5 in July versus a low point of 58.5 in March 1933 and a peak of 116.7 in July
1929. This change was partly due to the end of the banking crisis, partly due to the devaluation of the dollar,
which helped to raise prices, and partly due to the confidence Roosevelt inspired.241
In July, stock prices had a big correction. The Dow Jones Industrials had fallen 19.96 points in just three days!
This raised concerns that the good times were over and the economy was going to plunge again. But this time
the opposite was true. Prices traded in a range for several months before moving higher.

If gold was a good asset to hold but illegal, were gold stocks a good proxy and therefore a good investment?
Initially, they were, but later they were not. The fixed gold price and inflation were bad for gold mining
companies as their costs rose – e.g., “He would not let them sell their gold to anyone except the U.S. government
and the Government would pay only $20.67. Gold miners were out of luck – their costs mounted but the price of
their product remained the same.” However, because Roosevelt wanted to have this mined gold in foreign
exchange, Roosevelt decided to allow the gold mines to deliver their product to the Federal Reserve and the Fed
to sell the gold to foreign buyers at the world price. We are not sure exactly how this deal worked.242
The devaluation had converted unacceptable deflation into acceptable inflation.243 There was no statement of
an inflation target (which nowadays we would expect), but the results were the same. Inflation went from -10%
in 1932, to -5% in 1933 and +3% in 1934, mostly because the dollar fell by 39% against gold and 36% against
the pound in 1933 (December to December).
Fearing more attacks on their wealth, U.S. citizens exported their dollars by the hundreds of millions to get them
some place that they felt was safer. “‘One of our problems,’ droned Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, chairman of
Britain’s delegation, ‘is the flood of unwanted money that is pouring into our banks. These funds, deposited in the
main by U.S. investors, are subject to withdrawal at 24-hour notice and are of little or no value, though it has not
yet been discovered how to get rid of them.’”244 Interestingly, Washington encouraged the flight of the dollar to
weaken it. Unlike exports of gold, which were strictly banned for private citizens, the flight from the dollar was
quietly encouraged by Washington.245
It turned out that Roosevelt could not declare gold to be illegal to own outright, since that would have been a
violation of the Constitution, so he took another approach which the courts ruled permissible. It was ordered
that all U.S. citizens file a report to declare how much gold they held. Failure to file the report carried a $10,000
fine or ten years in jail.246

International Devaluations Follow the Dollar Devaluation
Between 1934 and 1936 there was a battle of official devaluations to gain price and trade advantages.248
Eventually, the French franc’s overvaluation led to domestic pressures to devalue, which caused the French to act
in September 1936. As part of that devaluation, the Tripartite Agreement was reached among the United States,
Britain and France, which essentially stated that each nation would refrain from competitive exchange
depreciation. By then, it became obvious that all countries could just as easily devalue their currencies in
response to other devaluations, and a war of competitive devaluation caused turbulence only to get everyone
right back where they began.249 At the end of the day, the result was that all currencies devalued a lot against
gold and not much against each other.
It was the contraction from the 1937 high which gave rise to a new term which was “recession.”250 It is worth a
look at some of the key stats from 1933-1941.

In 1933-37, bond yields fell and credit spreads shrank. The spread between Moody’s AAA corporate bond yield
and that of U.S. Treasury issues began to narrow significantly. Corporate yields declined by 27.3% while
Treasury yields declined only 17.2%. Stock prices rose, money supply grew and capitalism returned essentially to
normal, though at a greatly reduced rate from the 1929 peak. Let’s look at this increase in capital formation.
Money supply, as measured by M1, rose some 55% between 1933 and 1937, and total credit expanded by 8%.
However, this increase in total debt was due to a 36% increase in government debt and virtually no change in
private sector debt. Nominal GDP rose by 48% and the GDP deflator rose by 8% (1.5% per year). Of the $36
billion increase in nominal GDP that occurred from the end of 1932 to the end of 1937, $5 billion was from
government spending, $18 billion was from private domestic spending and $ 5 billion was from exports.251 The
wholesale price index rose 30.8%, or 5.5% per year.

In 1937, signs of the economy stalling emerged. The stock market had rallied back to the November 1929 low.
Commodities, at their peak in 1937, barely managed to rally then declined to new lows. When the severe
recession into 1938 began, government expenditures continued to rise in the United States. Total government
purchases rose 8.7%, while total GDP declined 5%. Unemployment rose 32.8% between 1937 and 1938, to a
rate of 17%. Interest rates began to decline from their 1937 high.252
By 1937, real GDP had finally reached its 1929 levels. It was not until 1954 that the Dow finally reached its 1929
levels. In 1939 the U.K. went to war with Germany, which begins another story.

Appendix One

Roosevelt’s First Inaugural Address
President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration, and I am certain that my
fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a
decision which the present situation of our nation impels.
This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from
honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and
will prosper.
So first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear...is fear itself... nameless,
unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.
In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and
support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that
support to leadership in these critical days. In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common
difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels: taxes have
risen, our ability to pay has fallen, government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income, the means of
exchange are frozen in the currents of trade, the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side, farmers
find no markets for their produce, the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.
More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number
toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.
Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with
the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be
thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a
generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.
Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own
stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failures and abdicated. Practices of the
unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of
men.
True, they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of
credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money.
Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to
exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored conditions. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers.
They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.
The money changers have fled their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple
to the ancient truths.
The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary
profit.
Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money, it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative
effort.

The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits.
These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto
but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow-men.
Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment
of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be values only by the standards of pride of
place and personal profit, and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has
given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing.
Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of
obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.
Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action, and action now.
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and
courageously.
It can be accompanied in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat
the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects
to stimulate and reorganize the use of our national resources.
Hand in hand with this, we must frankly recognize the over-balance of population in our industrial centers and, by
engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted
for the land.
The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to
purchase the output of our cities.
It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss, through foreclosure, of our small
homes and our farms.
It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that
their cost be drastically reduced.
It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical and unequal. It
can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and
other utilities which have a definitely public character.
There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must
act, and act quickly.
Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the
old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to
speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.
These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for
their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.
Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making
income balance outgo.

Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are, to point in time and necessity, secondary to the
establishment of a sound national economy.
I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by
international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.
The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic.
It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the
United States...a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the
pioneer.
It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.
In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor...the neighbor who
resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others...the neighbor who respects his
obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.
If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our
interdependence on each other: that we cannot merely take, but we must give as well, that if we are to go
forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline,
because, without such discipline, no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.
We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline because it makes possibly a
leadership which aims at a larger good.
This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will hind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity
of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.
With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people, dedicated to a
disciplined attack upon our common problems.
Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our
ancestors.
Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in
emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form.
That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the
modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter
internal strife, of world relations.
It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet
the unprecedented task before us.
But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure
from that normal balance of public procedure.
I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a
stricken world may require.
But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these courses, and in the event that the national
emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me.

© 2015 Ray Dalio

112

I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis... broad executive power to wage a
war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a
foreign foe.
For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.
We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity, with the clear consciousness
of seeking old and precious moral values, with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of
duty by old and young alike.
We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.
We do not distrust the future of essential democracy.
The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want
direct, vigorous action.
They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of
their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I will take it.
In this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us! May
He guide me in the days to come!

Appendix Two

Legislative Changes 1930-1937
1930 – 1932
•

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,253 1930
o This act raised tariffs on over 20,000 goods.

•

The Reconstruction Finance Act, 1932; created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
o Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), 1932 -53; Established under Hoover during the
Great Depression to give financial aid to both private firms and public organizations; the
corporation was authorized to lend to banks, building and loan associations, agricultural credit
corporations, mortgage companies, insurance companies, states and their political subdivisions,
and other public agencies. In 22 years the RFC loaned more than $12,000,000,000 - total
funding dispersed from 1932 through 1941 was $9.465 billion. The RFC was empowered to
organize subsidiary companies; the RFC Mortgage Company was established in 1935. The
Disaster Loan Corporation was organized in 1937 to aid persons affected by floods and other
catastrophes. During World War II, through the Defense Plant Corporation, a subsidiary, the
RFC was also authorized to make loans to enterprises essential to the war effort. The loans
were nearly all repaid. RFC was abolished as an independent agency by act of Congress (1953)
and was transferred to the Dept. of the Treasury to wind up its affairs, effective June, 1954; in
1953 the agency's functions were transferred to the Small Business Administration and other
agencies.

•

Federal Reserve Act, 1913; (during the Depression the Act was amended a number of times)
o Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act254 This authority was added to the Federal Reserve Act in
1932 (July) and was intended to give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to respond to
emergency conditions.
o Glass-Steagall Act, 1932; temporarily permitted the Fed to use U.S. government securities to
back its note issues (this authority was made permanent in 1933); the Federal Reserve Act (as
amended in 1917) had required the Reserve Banks to maintain gold reserves equal to 40% of
their note issues with the remaining 60% in form of either gold or “eligible paper” (e.g.,
commercial loans). The Act expanded the definition of “eligible paper” to include government
securities.
 Section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act (as amended in 1932) made formal the ability of
the Fed to accept virtually any kind of collateral as part of its discount window lending.
o Thomas Amendment to Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 permitted the Fed to adjust
commercial bank reserve requirements; gave the President the authority to require open market
purchases by the Fed, and to fix the weights of gold and silver dollars.
o Section 7 of the Securities Act of ’34 gives the Fed the authority to set margin requirements on
securities.
o Gold Reserve Act, 1934; authorized the transfer of monetary gold stock to the Treasury.
o Silver Purchase Act, 1934; authorized limited Fed lending to industrial and commercial firms.
o The Banking Act, 1935; expanded the Fed’s authority to adjust reserve requirements; enhanced
authority of the Board of Governors vis-à-vis the Federal Reserve Banks.
 Reorganized the system of governance to create the FOMC and merged the offices of
the chairman and governor to avoid conflicts.

1st 100 Days (March - May 1933)
•

The Emergency Banking Act, 1933; This measure called for a four-day mandatory shutdown of U.S.
banks for inspections before they could be reopened. It provided for the reopening of banks after federal
inspectors had declared them to be financially sound and it ratified the suspension of the gold standard
instituted through executive order. The law also gave the Secretary of the Treasury the authority
through an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act to confiscate the gold of private citizens,
excluding dentists' and jewelers' gold and “rare and unusual” coins. These citizens received an
equivalent amount of paper currency.

•

The Economy Act for Purchasing Goods or Services, 1933; cut federal costs through cuts of veterans’
pensions and reductions in government department budgets. Also permitted the federal government to
purchase goods or services from other federal government agencies or major organizational units within
the same agency.

•

Beer-Wine Revenue Act, 1933; legalized and taxed wine and beer.

•

Emergency Conservation Work Act (ECWA), 1933
o Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), 1933 - 1942; first created by Executive Order and later
codified in ECWA was a public works project, operated under the control of the army, which
was designed to promote environmental conservation while employing the young unemployed.
Recruits planted trees, built wildlife shelters, stocked rivers and lakes with fish, and cleared
beaches and campgrounds. Some 2.5 million young men were ultimately put to work on
environmental projects.

•

Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA), 1933 -1935
o Established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) to distribute $500 million to
states and localities for relief or for wages on public works; FERA would eventually pay out
approx. $3 billion; FERA was the first of the New Deal's major relief operations. It provided
assistance for the unemployed, supporting nearly five million households each month by
funding work projects for more millions of mostly unskilled workers. It also provided
vaccinations and literacy classes for millions who could not afford them; it was replaced by
Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935.
o Federal Surplus Relief Corporation, later changed to the Federal Surplus Commodities
Corporation, 1933; one of the programs instituted under FERA; it helped farmers by buying up
price-depressing surplus commodities from the open market; and it served as the agency
through which these surplus commodities were made available to the state and local relief
administrations for distribution to those in need of relief. It was continued as an agency under
the Secretary of Agriculture and consolidated in 1940 with the Division of Marketing and
Marketing Agreements into the Surplus Marketing Administration, and finally merged into the
Agricultural Marketing Administration by Executive Order 9069 of February 23, 1942.

•

Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), 1933; designed to help American farmers by stabilizing prices and
limiting overproduction, the AAA initiated the first direct subsidies to farmers who did not plant crops;
precursor to current Farm Bill. Through the AAA, farmers were paid to reduce their crops, either by
plowing them under or by not cultivating a certain amount of acreage. The targeted commodities were
wheat, cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, milk, and hogs (young livestock were slaughtered); the cost of the
program was assumed by a tax on middlemen and food processors, such as grain elevator operators and
meatpacking companies. By 1934, the production of several staple crops had decreased and farm prices,
as well as farm income, rose accordingly; in 1935, the United States Supreme Court declared the tax
paying for the program unconstitutional as an unnecessary invasion of private property rights. The AAA
payments, however, were quickly reinstituted without the “processing tax” under the Soil Conservation
and Domestic Allotment Act, 1935.

o
•

The Second AAA (1938) provided for the storage of surplus crops in government warehouses
and made loans to farmers in years of overproduction to compensate for lower market prices.

Tennessee Valley Authority Act (TVA), 1933; created the Tennessee Valley Authority; considered one of
the more ambitious reform programs. It was created for the purpose of developing the Tennessee River
watershed, revitalizing the seven-state region – one particularly hard hit by the Great Depression – by
building 16 dams to control flooding, generate hydraulic power, and increase agricultural production.
TVA provided jobs, low-cost housing, reforestation, and many other conservation-related services to the
region; TVA brought electricity, flood control, and recreational facilities to seven comparatively
impoverished states. Today, the TVA is still the largest public provider of electricity in the United States.

2nd 100 Days (June 1933)
•

Joint Resolution to abandon the gold standard, 1933; abandoned the gold standard.

•

National Employment System Act (June 6); created the U.S. Employment Service.

•

Home Owners Refinancing Act, 1933; established the Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) to assist
in the refinancing of homes. Between 1933 and 1935, one million people received long term loans
through the agency.

•

The Banking Act (better known as 2nd Glass-Steagall Act), 1933; it set forth stringent regulations for
banks; it required the separation of investment and commercial banking functions – only 10% of a
commercial bank’s income could come from securities; empowered the Fed to regulate interest rates on
demand and savings deposits (Regulation Q); provided bank depositors with insurance of up to $5,000
through the newly formed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

•

The Farm Credit Act, 1933; provided refinancing of farm mortgages – refinanced about 20% of all farm
mortgages in 18 months.

•

Farm Credit Agency (FCA) , a Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) overseeing the Farm Credit
System – a network of borrower-owned lending institutions - and tasked with providing American
agriculture with a dependable source of credit. Originally established in 1916 in response to farmer
requests for liberal credit facilities and low interest rates, the FCA initially provided a system for
mortgage credit through 12 regional farm land banks with most of the original capital supplied by the
government. In 1932, the government invested $125 million in the bonds of the farm land banks to
bolster them and thus again became the majority stockholder. All then existing federal agriculturalcredit organizations were unified into one agency, the FCA. Congress authorized that agency to extend
the system of farm-mortgage credit. Funds were made available for loans on easy terms for first or
second mortgages to debtors whose collateral was so low in value or so encumbered by debt as to make
refinancing by the land banks unfeasible. In 1933, the FCA was also authorized to establish 12 production
credit corporations and banks for cooperatives. The result was a centralized source of farm credit. A part
of the Dept. of Agriculture after 1939, the FCA again became an independent agency in 1953 supervising
the Farm Credit System for American agriculture.

•

Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 1933; increased federal regulation of railroads.

•

National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), 1933;
o Established the National Recovery Administration (NRA) to stimulate production through
curtailed competition and having American industries set up a series of codes designed to
regulate prices, industrial output, and general trade practices. The federal government, in turn,

would agree to enforce these codes. In return for their cooperation, federal officials promised to
suspend anti-trust legislation. Portions of the NIRA were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court in 1935 because it violated the separation of powers clause; however, the Works Progress
Administration (WPA), which was the second part of the NIRA, was allowed to stand. The
majority of NIRA’s collective bargaining stipulations survived in two subsequent bills: Section
7A of the NIRA recognized the rights of labor to organize and to have collective bargaining, and
the labor provisions of the fair-competition codes established the 40-hour week, set a
minimum weekly wage, and prohibited child labor under the age of 16; NIRA also earmarked
$3.3 billion for public works through the Public Works Administration (PWA).
Public Works Administration (PWA), 1933 - 1941; the PWA created public works as economic
stimulus and continued until the U.S. ramped up wartime production for World War II; received
a $3.3 billion appropriation; built large public works projects; used private contractors (did not
directly hire unemployed); PWA’s efforts mostly focused on permanent projects, including the
first federal housing program, support for public power through reclamation projects in the
West, and a range of public improvements from bridges to lighthouses.

Commodity Credit Corporation, 1933; created by Executive Order 6340, was a government-owned and
operated entity designed to provide loans, make purchases and perform other actions to ensure farmers
were paid higher prices and ultimately the continual distribution of agricultural commodities.

•

Securities Acts of 1933 (“Truth in Securities Act”) & 1934; the’33 Act required that any offer or sale of
securities using the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be registered pursuant to the
1933 Act; codified standards for sale and purchase of stock and required risk of investments to be
accurately disclosed;
o The ’34 Act created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934, as an independent
agency; the SEC was created primarily to restore the stability of the stock market after the
crash of October 1929 and to prevent corporate abuses relating to the offering and sale of
securities.

•

Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, 1933; was established by Executive Order 7057 with the
purpose of providing relief and reconstruction for Puerto Rico.

•

Civil Works Administration (CWA), 1933-34; created under the auspices of the Federal Emergency
Relief Act, the CWA was to create temporary jobs for millions of unemployed; its focus on high paying
jobs in the construction arena resulted in a much greater expense to the federal government than
originally anticipated; it provided construction jobs for more than four million people who were paid $15
per week to work on schools, roads, and sewers; the CWA ended in 1934 in large part due to opposition
to its cost.

Communications Act, 1934;
o Established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as the successor to the Federal
Radio Commission; tts function was to merge the administrative responsibilities for regulating
broadcasting and wire communications into one centralized agency; today, this independent,
quasi-judicial agency is charged with the regulation of all nonfederal governmental use of radio
and television broadcasting and all interstate telecommunications (wire, satellite, and cable), as
well as all international communications that originate or terminate in the United States.

monetary gold stock to the U.S. Treasury.

•

The Silver Purchase Act, 1934; provided for the nationalization of domestic stocks of silver and for the
purchase of silver by the Treasury until the price should reach $1.2929 per ounce or the value of the
amount held should equal one-third of the value of the government's gold holdings.

•

National Housing Act (NHA), 1934;
o It established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency targeted at combating the
housing crisis of the Great Depression; this program focused on stimulating the growth of the
building industry through provisioning of federal mortgage insurance for low-income borrowers;
helped advance the concept of long-term amortized mortgages.

•

Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act, 1934; permitted a series of tariff reduction agreements with key
trading partners, such Canada, the U.K., and others.

Resettlement Administration, 1935; was a relief organization created by Executive Order 7027 that
provided assistance to poor farmers and sharecroppers. The RA was a precursor to the Farm Security
Administration.
Farm Security Administration (FSA), 1937; created under the authority provided by the aforementioned
Federal Emergency Relief Act, the FSA was a relief organization directed at improving the lot of the poor
farmers and sharecroppers. The FSA established temporary housing for Dust Bowl refugees from
Oklahoma and Arkansas who had migrated to California in hopes of finding employment; in total, the
FSA loaned more than a billion dollars to farmers and set up many camps for destitute migrant workers.

Revenue Act, or “Wealth Tax Act,” 1935; the Act raised tax rates on incomes above $50,000. The Act
did little to increase federal tax revenue, and it did not significantly redistribute income.

•

Social Security Act, 1935; established the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA was designed
to combat the widespread poverty among senior citizens; it administers a national pension fund for
retired persons, an unemployment insurance system, and a public assistance program for dependent
mothers, children, and the physically disabled. Paid for by employee and employer payroll contributions;
required years of contributions, so first payouts were in 1942.

•

Emergency Relief Appropriations Act (ERF), 1935; appropriated nearly $5 billion to create some 3.5
million jobs.
o

Works Progress Administration, 1935 – 1939 & (renamed) Works Project Administration
(WPA), 1939-1943 was funded by the ERF – created by Executive Order; it was the largest New
Deal agency established to provide work for the unemployed. Between 1935 and 1941, the WPA
employed an average of two million people a year mostly working on construction work, also
sewing projects for women and arts projects for unemployed artists, musicians and writers.
WPA went on to spent some $11 billion on reforestation, flood control, rural electrification,
water works, sewage plants, school buildings, slum clearance, student scholarships, and other
projects, e.g., the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia in 1937. In total, the WPA came to employ
more than eight million people; WPA workers built 650,000 miles of roads; constructed,
repaired or improved 124,000 bridges, 125,000 public buildings, and 700 miles of airport
runways; under the arts program, many artists, photographers, writers, and actors became
government employees, working on a myriad of public projects ranging from painting murals to
writing national park guidebooks.

Weimar Republic Deleveraging 1920s
This document provides a timeline of Germany’s Weimar Republic during the years from 1914 through 1924.
Both German industrial production and the German stock market peaked around the start of World War I in
1914. It wasn’t until 1927 that the economy reached its 1914 level and not until around 1960 that real stock
market prices returned to their 1914 peak.255 Within this long period of inflationary deleveraging is one of the
most acute periods of inflationary deleveraging ever, which occurred in 1922-1923. This is a period of special
interest and focus to us because of the perspective it provides. As with other cases, I want to convey market
movements as well as notable historical developments, especially the very large market whipsaws that
accompanied the near total destruction of financial wealth during this time.
The timeline is divided into four periods. These periods were selected to represent distinct phases in the
depreciation of the mark. When possible, events are arranged chronologically within each of the phases.

Overview
Depressions arise when (a) debt service obligations become unsustainably large in relation to the cash flows to
service them, (b) investors seek to convert a large amount of financial assets into cash, and (c) monetary policy
is ineffective. Because monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit, credit creation turns into credit
contraction until this fundamental imbalance between the need for cash and the amount of cash available is
rectified. Until the fundamental imbalance is rectified, a cash shortage causes debt and liquidity problems. This
cash shortage, and these liquidity problems, cause financial assets to be sold for cash (i.e., M0), which worsens
the cash shortage and puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between (a) keeping the amount
of money the same and allowing the shortage of cash to become more acute, thus driving up interest rates and
causing the credit crisis to worsen, and (b) printing more money, thus depreciating its value. The Weimar
Republic case study, like the 1980s Latin America case study, is interesting in examining the dynamic behind the
process of alleviating the fundamental imbalance primarily through the creation of cash (i.e., M0)
As with the other cases of deleveraging, in this case, there were many swings in markets and economic
conditions so, from the perspective of someone trying to navigate through this period, it is important to
understand these swings and see the cause-effect relationships behind them.
To help to convey the big picture before I get into the chronology, I want to show a few charts of the total
timeframe. The ones that follow show the real stock market, the real exchange rate, real economic activity, and
the inflation rate from 1913-1927, with the vertical lines designating the beginnings of each of the four phases
referred to in the table of contents. The percentages noted in each chart are meant to convey the very big swings
along the way. It is very important for us to understand what caused these swings and to visualize how our game
plan would have navigated these. The chronology that follows will explain these movements.

In order to gain a big picture perspective, it is also important to view Germany’s deleveraging within the context
of the world economy at the time. To convey this, the table below shows industrial production (a proxy for
economic activity) for Germany, France, the UK, and the US. Note that (a) Germany’s economic activity plunged
more severely than other economies after the war, (b) the German economy grew, while the UK and France
contracted in 1921, and (c) the German economy plunged while the UK and France grew in 1923. You will also
note the recovery that followed the post-war deleveraging and that occurred in 1920-22, and that it was
followed by the very classic inflationary deleveraging that occurred in 1922-1923. The reasons will also be made
clear in the chronology.

World War I Period
1914 – November 1918

World War I began in 1914 and ended in November 1918. It set the stage for the period that we will be examining
because it resulted in Germany having very large domestic and foreign debts. During the war years, Germany
spent a lot of money on the war, much of which was financed by borrowing from its people; it then lost the war
and acquired a huge foreign debt in the form of war reparations. While Germany’s deleveraging was largely a
consequence of the debts arising from the war, deleveragings are debt crises, regardless of their causes, so the
fact that Germany’s arose from the war is essentially irrelevant to our examination of the inflationary
deleveraging dynamic.256
As with most countries at the time, Germany was on the gold standard at the beginning of the war – i.e., to
borrow money, it guaranteed the value of the money by promising to convert money into gold. When it was
unable to meet those commitments it defaulted – i.e., it broke its promise to allow holders of currency to convert
it to gold.257
For Germany default came on August 4, 1914 when the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) “suspended” the
conversion of money for gold. As with all other countries’ suspensions of gold convertibility, this default
occurred because investors executed their right to turn their money into gold in large numbers, which caused the
government’s gold reserves to fall a lot, so that it became obvious that the central bank would not have enough
gold to fulfill its commitment. Whenever (a) the amount of money in circulation is much greater than the
amount of gold held in reserves to back the money at the designated price of conversion, and (b) investors are
converting money into gold because they are worried about the value of their money, the central bank is in the
untenable position of having to either reduce the supply of money in circulation (i.e., tighten credit) or to end
convertibility and print more money. Central banks almost always choose suspending convertibility and printing
more money. Such was the case in mid-August 1914 in Germany. At that time, the Reichsbank chose to break its
promise to deliver gold so that it could freely print money. On the same date, another law passed that authorized
the Reichsbank to discount short-term bills issued by the Treasury and to use them, together with commercial
bills, as collateral for its notes. So also, on August 4 the central bank decided to free itself from all constraints
that limited its ability to print money and simultaneously initiate money printing activities. According to the
weekly statements of the Reichsbank, in the two weeks from July 24 to August 7, the quantity of the Reichsbank
notes in circulation increased by more than two billion marks,258 an increase of approximately 30%. Knowing
that this move would lead to inflation, on the same date (August 4), a "Law Concerning Maximum Prices,“ which
imposed price controls and a freeze in rents,259 was also passed by the Reichstag. Nonetheless, as a result of
this decision to eliminate constraints on money production, currency and credit inflation began in Germany
directly after the outbreak of the war.
Before 1914 gold coins represented about 40% of the monetary base, but they were withdrawn from circulation
by the Reichsbank after the outbreak of war. The Reichsbank’s gold reserves amounted to 1,253 million marks on
July 31, 1914. Because the central bank took the private gold into its possession (i.e., because the government
essentially confiscated the gold from private investors), at the end of 1918, the Reichsbank had 2,262 million
marks in gold –i.e., its gold reserves had nearly doubled.260
These moves—i.e., eliminating the link between currency and gold, printing a lot of money to buy government
debt, and establishing price controls—are classic ingredients of reflation. In all cases, they are accompanied by
currency devaluations and gold revaluations. They are frequently accompanied by the government outlawing
gold and the government taking it into its possession. Often these moves are accompanied by foreign exchange

controls. The last time this mix of policies was deployed in the U.S. was in 1971. These things happened in
Germany in 1914.
The printing of money was primarily to fund the government’s deficits and alleviate other debt burdens. The
table below shows, in millions marks, the total income, expenditure and budget deficit of the German Reich
during the years 1914-1918. As conveyed, in these war years, the amounts of money spent and the deficits
increased a lot.

The difference between the total expenditure and the total income was covered by issuing Treasury bills that
were bought by the Reichsbank, which directly increased the currency in circulation,261 fueling inflation.
Naturally, investors worried about the depreciating value of their money ran to gold, essentially the only noncredit based money, so gold was outlawed.
The debt that the German government issued to finance the war was primarily floating debt because investors
had become wary about lending the government money in exchange for longer maturity debt,262 fearing that they
would be paid back with depreciated money. These fears were learned, arising from investors who had held
long-term bonds being burned. The issuing of floating debt required the government to print more money faster
in order to pay off these short-term debts in depreciated rather than hard money, which drove depositors into
even shorter term money, and so on, until in the autumn of 1916 investors became wary about lending, even short
term, so the sums yielded by the loans were always less than the amounts of the floating debt.
After the outbreak of the war, the publication of war statistics stopped. They were only renewed in 1920.263 As a
result, data for this period is sparse.

Post-War Period

November 1918 - December 1921
1918
Germany lost the war, so naturally stocks plunged and there was capital flight from Germany’s paper. As a
result, the mark plunged from November 1918 to July 1919 264 and the debt soared. From the end of October 1918
to the end of March 1919, the floating debt of the Reich rose by 15.6 billion paper marks,265 an increase of 32%. In
contrast with the war years, the mark’s depreciation occurred via the dollar exchange rate as the dollar became
the world’s most important currency. As a result of this depreciation, prices of imported goods rose more rapidly
than prices of domestic goods. From November 1918 until July 1919, M0 grew at an annualized rate of 102%, the
price of gold in paper marks increased by 210%, the inflation rate averaged an annualized 48%, and industrial
production fell at an annualized rate of 43%.
The signing the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919 triggered a new plunge in the exchange rate as it then
became obvious the debts imposed on Germany by the Treaty would have a devastating effect on Germany’s
balance of payments266 for years to come. At this point, Germany was saddled with a very large domestic debt
and a large foreign debt.
While from October 1918 through early 1919, share prices fell a lot, in the second half of 1919 they rose a lot in
paper mark terms due to the very rapid depreciation of the mark. This was the beginning of the very classic
dynamic of rapid depreciations in the value of money causing illusions of price gains of stocks and tangible
assets. In the case of Germany’s stock market, at the time, the rise was much less than the currency’s
depreciation and less than the rise in the price of gold (which reflects the value of money), stocks were a
disastrous investment. The indexed value of stocks in gold terms fell from 69.3 in October 1918 to 8.5 in
February 1920. Similarly, in inflation adjusted terms, stocks were a horrible investment, i.e., in February 1920,
real share prices had fallen to only about 12 percent of their 1913 value.267 Similarly, from a foreign investor’s
perspective, investing in Germany’s stock market was a losing proposition. So, during this time gold was the
preferred asset to hold, shares were a disaster even though they rose, bonds were wiped out, and rent controls
made real estate very bad. In other words, the market action was clearly consistent with that of an inflationary
deleveraging.
The end of World War I brought economic problems to almost everyone. As is typical of deleveragings,
economic problems brought clashes between capitalists, “the haves,” and the proletariat, “the have-nots,” and
these clashes caused big political shifts. These clashes were not confined to Germany—they were global. For
example, the Russian Revolution occurred in November 1918, where the proletariat took wealth and power from
the capitalists.268

1919 – 1920
In 1919, the German government (i.e., the Reich) found it impossible to raise the money it needed without
continuing to issue new floating debt at an accelerating rate. The revenues of the Reich had only a modest
increase so this revenue increase didn’t do much to reduce their overwhelming reliance on deficit financing,
which was then forced to be almost exclusively through short-term borrowing.269 At times when governments
need more money than they can borrow from foreign investors, (i.e., when the economy is depressed and budget
deficits are large), they are faced with the choice of directly taxing the rich (who are the only ones who can afford
to “contribute”) or indirectly taxing them by printing money which devalues the claims of debt holders. They
typically do both. Germany did both.
Big taxes of various forms were enacted. Specifically:
(1) In 1919 and 1920 numerous new laws were put into place to create numerous and complex taxes. In fact,
Matthias Erzberger, the finance minister at the time, proclaimed that in the future Germany the rich should be no
more.270
(2) In December 1919 the government passed the “War Levy on Capital Gains” and the “Extraordinary War Levy
for Fiscal Year 1919,” creating wealth taxes that were strongly progressive, rising from 10% of the value of assets
at five thousand marks to 65% at above seven million marks. According to original estimates, the tax was
expected to take up to one third of German national wealth, which would then be used to redeem the state’s war
debts. However, since the tax was for the most part payable in cash and those who were taxed couldn’t convert
their wealth into cash fast enough, the Reich had no choice but to permit payment by installment. In fact in some
cases it could be spread over up to 28 ½ years, or in the case of landed property up to forty-seven years.271 The
government treated these tax debts as mortgages.
(3) The Secretary of the State proposed that the taxes due should take the form of mortgages denominated in
gold in favor of the State and should be imposed on all properties, though interest payments could be made in
paper money that was price indexed (e.g., for farmers they were indexed to grain prices). However, when it
came to paying its debts, the government did so in paper money that could depreciate. Clearly, the government
was allowing itself, but not the taxpayers, to depreciate its debts through money creation. As an additional
wealth tax, the government proposed that a certain percentage of the equity of public and private companies
should be given to the State.272
(4) The “Reich Emergency Contribution” taxed the wealthier classes as part of the great Erzberger tax reforms.
It was also payable in installments, which was contrary to the original conception, so it became a recurrent
charge on wealth in addition to wealth holders’ existing liabilities under the “Defense Contribution” of 1919 and
the extraordinary “War Levy” of 1917.273 Because of inflation and the method of valuing real property and
industrial plants, those who owned securities or mortgages (i.e., financial assets) were worse off than
landowners and industrialists (i.e., owners of tangible assets).
At the time, economists recognized that the claims of those who held financial assets were too large to be paid
back in the promised manner (i.e., with the value of money being maintained) without resulting in great hardship.
So, rather than wanting to fight inflation, policy makers explicitly advocated accelerated inflation as a means of
taxation. The plan was for the Reich to redeem its long-term debt prematurely at par value by obtaining the cash
from the central bank, or to convert its long-dated bonds into treasury bills. This would eliminate the threat of
the government going bankrupt. Also, it was widely recognized that depreciating the currency would have

stimulative effects on the economy and make Germany more competitive in world markets. As one official put it,
it was better "to exploit to the full the opportunities afforded by money creation, than to cripple the forces of
production and the spirit of enterprise by a confiscatory tax policy."274
It was widely recognized that, though breaking the commitment to pay debts in money of stable value is evil, it is
the lesser of two evils. For example, a German economist at the time, Dr. Bendixen, who favored printing money
to devalue debtors’ claims said, “I have never denied that what I propose is an evil, but it is the only means of
preventing a still worse evil…We may deprecate the fraudulent excesses of speculation and of entrepreneurial
activity that the inflation would bring—and not without reason: but are we on this account to prefer the corpsestrewn battlefield into which the repudiation of the War Loans would turn our economy?” Bendixen believed it
would be impossible, or at least extremely injurious to the economy, to repay the War Loans out of taxation. He
also regarded inflation as preferable to the type of tax system that—under existing political conditions—was
threatening wealth holders and high income groups in the manner proposed. Similarly, Keynes said, “The
inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse, because it is worse in
an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier.”275 By “rentier” he meant the
person who rented out his capital.
Germany’s total debt—i.e., its external debt on top of its internal debt—was so huge that it must have been
obvious to anyone with a sharp pencil that any attempt to service it, let alone to pay it off, would have caused a
deflationary deleveraging of unimaginable severity, so it was not going to happen. No government could have
survived such a policy. When there isn’t much chance that the government can service or pay back its debt via
taxation there is always an implicit risk that it will print currency and depreciate the currency’s value. This is not
just an observation of Germany at the time—it is a timeless and universal truth.276
In contrast with the easy money policies that existed in Germany at the time, tight money policies were being
followed in other countries because, at the end of 1919 and beginning of 1920, Britain and the USA were in booms
that had to be brought under control. For example, interest rates on three-month money, which were less than
6% in the first nine months of 1919, averaged about 8% in 1920 in the U.S.
Naturally, high tax rates on the wealthy coming at the same time as their net worths were being eroded in their
investments and due to the bad economy, caused them to desperately try to preserve their rapidly shrinking
wealth at all costs. This led to extremely high rates of tax evasion and the flight of capital abroad.277 This is
typical in deleveragings. It also typically leads to governments establishing controls on both tax evasion and
citizens of the country taking money abroad. As we will see shortly, that is what happened in Germany.
At the time, the Allies (i.e., the countries that won the war) were understandably worried that Germany would
pay them back with worthless paper money, so on December 13, 1919, they reached an agreement with Germany
that forbid the Reichsbank from disposing of its gold reserve.278 As we will see later, this gold stock was to play
an important role in determining how events transpired in subsequent years.

Currency depreciation is, in cases other than hyperinflation, normally stimulative to short-term economic activity
and bullish for inflation hedge assets and stocks. So, these declines in the mark stimulated the German economy
in late 1919 and early 1920. They gave an especially strong stimulus to exports, which is normal.279 Also, the low
real interest rates stimulated domestic demand. So, the German economy picked up, and the number of
unemployed fell rapidly. Because of the mark’s decline, the divergence between German prices and world prices
was large and German wages remained low. This caused German businesses to do well, so confidence in the
stock market improved and prices rose. Because of the very rapid currency depreciation and price declines of
Government securities, mortgages, and debentures—in fact, all securities with a fixed yield—declined in value.

So, in 1919, this decline in the value of debt instruments also drove investors to buy shares and other assets like
gold for their “intrinsic” value. The public now saw that the paper mark and debt could no longer fulfill the
function of the “store of value.”280
The period between the start of 1919 and spring 1920 was one when stock prices rose continuously (nearly
doubling) because of buying for their intrinsic value, unemployment fell, and the currency entered a period of
“relative stabilization.” The chart below shows stock prices during this period.

1921
As noted earlier, central banks in other countries pursued tight money policies in 1920. These tight money
conditions in other countries in 1920 led to a bad world contraction in 1921. Though this was called a
deleveraging, which was then the name for all economic contractions, it was primarily driven by monetary
policies, so this contraction had some of the markings of what we refer to as a recession, though certainly it was
a very bad recession. Between 1920 and 1921, industrial production fell by 20% in the US, by 18.6% in the UK,
and by 11% in France, largely as a result of this monetary tightening. In the US, unemployment reached 12%. At
the bottom of the contraction, which occurred around mid-1921, 22% of the total population was out of work.281
So it was certainly a very severe global contraction.
However, economic conditions in Germany in 1920 and 1921 continued to be very different from those in the
other leading industrial countries—most importantly, Germany did not suffer a severe contraction because of its
reflationary policies—mostly because German monetary policies were easy (largely because of its easy money
policies and the absence of a tie with gold), while those in other countries were tight.282
As a result of these relative economic conditions and the differences in monetary policy that accompanied them,
the German exchange rate became more stable between April 1920 and May 1921. That was because conditions
in other countries were so bad that they drove investors to Germany. However this currency stability and
weakness in other economies naturally created difficulties for German export-dependent industries. But
domestic demand remained strong. As a result, German industrial production increased by 20.4% between
1920 and 1921, on the heels of the 46% increase that occurred between 1919 and 1920. So 1919-1921 was a
period of strong growth for Germany. Average unemployment during 1921 declined to only 2.8% of trade union
members, which was below the 1920 average of 3.8%.283 Still in 1921-22, German industrial production
remained much lower than in 1913, so this period of growth was within the period of greater economic
contraction for Germany.
In that year, the money supply remained almost stable—e.g., the gold mark was worth 14.2 paper marks in April
1920 and 14.9 in March 1921, as the world’s deflationary contraction and Germany’s favorable relative growth
supported the mark. In spite of that, the budget deficit was huge—roughly 15% of GDP—which equated to 60%
of the total expenses (in the financial year of 1920-21) and that large deficit was financed by the issue of
Treasury bills. So, in the period from February 1920 to May 1921, the supply of floating debt was increased a lot;
however, the inflationary effects were mitigated by the global deflationary period.284
In 2Q1920 the German economy began to weaken along with the global economy. The German currency had
been stable until May 1921, but then it began to soften. Then, along with the economy weakening, the Allies
restructured Germany’s external debt via the “London Ultimatum”. The “agreement” was called the “ultimatum”
because the allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany didn’t agree to the plan. It
specified the final payments plan which set war reparations at 132 billion gold marks, with 50 billion in gold
marks bonds up front and 2 billion gold marks in the first year, plus 1 billion gold marks over the next few months,
and some other taxes.285 In other words, it solidified a huge debt burden for Germany. Naturally that implied
that domestic debts and the currency would have to be depreciated because the government faced the choice of
either (a) printing and taxing, or (b) having money and credit tighten and the weak economy contract, and it was
obvious which they would choose.
While the German government was being pressured by these circumstances to print more money, Allied
governments wanted German currency stabilization because mark weakness made Germany more competitive.

British industry wanted “the competitive advantage on world markets which the fall in the mark was giving to
German industry to be curtailed” by a currency stabilization. At the time, unemployment in Britain reached
23.4%. But, as always, fundamentals won out over the Allies’ wishes, and German “currency dumping” began in
May 1921.
The new tax sources, made available to the Reich between 1919 and 1921 under the “Erzberger Reforms”, had
increased the revenues of the Reich during fiscal year 1921. There were enough tax revenues to cover ordinary
expenditures but not reparations. By the beginning of 1922, tax revenues had increased not only in nominal
terms, but even in gold mark values, while expenditures were strictly controlled. In the first quarter of the new
fiscal year (April-June 1922), Germany was able to finance not only its entire ordinary and extraordinary
expenditure out of taxation, but even to apply a considerable sum from the same source to meeting reparations
charges.
So let’s review. Economic weakness and the Ultimatum of London of May 1921 provoked the collapse of the
mark.286 It was originally proposed that reparations would equal an annuity of eight billion gold marks which
would have taken 23.2% of German national income in 1919, 21.3% in 1920, 19.8% in 1921 and 19.0% in 1922.
But these burdens were reduced to three billion gold marks by the London Ultimatum due to a more realistic
assessment of Germany’s capacity to pay. Still, three billion gold marks represented an enormous burden of
7.4% of German national income in 1921, 7.1% in 1922 and 8.0% in 1923, especially on top of German’s other
debts.287
Between 1919 and 1922 Germany paid at least the eight billion, which is the amount credited to Germany by the
Reparations Commission, though it is widely estimated that the payments were considerably more. The
independent and unconnected estimates by Keynes and by Moulton and McGuire—twenty-six billion—are
probably nearer the truth. In current gold marks aggregate German national income in the four years 1919-22
was 287.7 billion. Actual payments then ranged between 3.1% and 21.8% of this but were most likely (following
the Keynes or Moulton/McGuire estimates) about 10%.288 A historian recently calculated that a level of
taxation equal to thirty-five percent of national income would have been required to defray postwar expenditures
on reparations, social welfare, and the general running costs of the government.289 The estimate of the gold
mark value of the Reich’s current payments on reparations account was 4.9 billions in 1919, falling to 2.1 billions
in 1920. But with the London Ultimatum of May 1921, the gold mark value of payments began to rise again: 2.8
billions in that year and 3.4 billions in 1922.290 In other words, it was too much.
We can get a sense of the magnitude of the government’s funding needs by looking at the next table.
Reparations are included in the budget deficit numbers. As shown, it was huge. To fund this gap, the Reichsbank
had to print the money to make purchases of this debt.

The next chart shows the exchange rate, M0, the CPI, and the velocity of money during the 1920-24 period.
Notice that the decline in the currency value and the increase in the velocity of money led the increase in
inflation, which led M0 growth as the central bank chose to accommodate these demands. This is typical in all
monetary inflations, so you will also observe them to be true in the Brazilian, Argentine, Russian, and Thai cases.
In other words, money supply growth did not cause these other things to happen; rather investors’ movements of
capital out of debt and out of currency caused these changes, which the Reichsbank accommodated by printing
money (i.e., M0). The sudden rise in the velocity of money after July 1921 was due to the outbreak of a new crisis
of doubt in the value of holding cash.291

In August 1921 it was clear that getting adequate income and wealth taxes from the rich was difficult (largely
because incomes were down and wealth was illiquid), and those who opposed the “taxation of material wealth”
in the Reichstag were strong enough to be able to block many of the wealth tax attempts. The government then
abandoned the idea of a mortgage tax in favor of heavy taxes on consumption goods because they were more
effective. It is important to realize that wealth taxes are usually ineffective because much wealth is illiquid, and
because collections on the “mortgage” don’t generate much cash.
After the autumn of 1921, the depreciation of the German mark became even more rapid and economic activity
strengthened further. It was clear that a falling mark and rising inflation produced prosperity. According to the
official statistics, the number of unemployed, which was high at the beginning of 1919, fell continually until the
summer of 1922, when unemployment practically disappeared. However, any time there was an improvement of
the mark there then was an increase of unemployment (see March-July 1920; November 1920-February 1921;
December 1921-January 1922), and every depreciation of the mark was followed by an improvement in
conditions of the labor market (January-February 1920; July-November 1920; April-November 1921; and then
during the first half of 1922.) So it was clear that monetary stimulation and the weak exchange rate stimulated
the economy. When the mark depreciated, foreign and domestic demands for goods increased. Foreign
purchasers wanted to profit by the greater purchasing power of their own money in the Germany market, and the
prospect of continuous increases in prices stimulated the demand to buy goods as a means of getting out of a
depreciating currency. When the mark improved, foreign demand declined and in Germany there occurred what
in the summer of 1920 was called “the buyers’ strike.”
The German press called the industrial and commercial situation between October 1921 and the summer of 1922
one of “general liquidation” because the shops were empty due to foreigners buying a lot because the mark was
cheap, and Germans buying a lot because they worried about inflation. At the beginning of November 1921, the
flight from the mark became a panic which rapidly spread through all classes of society.
In November, the depreciation of the mark provoked a big increase in orders, especially for inflation hedge and
export items. The metallurgical industries were working at full capacity, so that they had to introduce overtime,
and they refused to accept new orders. As cars are long-lived, the automobile industry had a period of peak
prosperity. The textile trade had bookings for several months ahead, and the cotton firms refused to take new
orders. It was clear that accelerating inflation and rising trade competitiveness from the depreciating value of the
mark, rather than more sustainable drivers of growth, provided this demand.292

Then, from November 26 to December 1, 1921, the mark strengthened by about a third—i.e., the dollar rate fell
sharply from 293 to 190 paper marks.293 This big whipsaw appears to have been due to a short squeeze as the
speculation against the mark in many ways (typically from borrowing it and Germans keeping money outside the
country) became overdone. As always, the mark’s strength hurt the economy. In fact, press reports from that
time declared that the improvement of the mark had been a catastrophe for German industry.294 Trade orders
rapidly diminished. Eventually, the shorts were squeezed and the impacts on trade and capital flows began to
work against the mark.
So in February 1922 the mark began to fall, and on March 7 it was all the way back to 262 paper marks to the
dollar. And the economy picked up again. A new wave of commercial and industrial activity followed in the form
of panic buying. “It is no longer simply a zeal for acquiring, or even a rage: it is a madness,” according to one
observer of the time. Merchants bought for fear that if they waited the stocks would be exhausted. As a result,
1922 was a boom year, though in 1922 (which was the year of greatest economic expansion after the war) the
level of economic activity still was no more than 70-80% of production in 1913, so despite this strength, the
economy was still in the contraction that began in 1918.295
While one might think that the boom of 1922 was good for workers, it wasn’t. That is because there was a big
contrast between the continual increase of German production and wages, which did not keep up with inflation.
Also, there was a deficiency in agricultural production due to the lack of certain chemical fertilizers and a
shortage of labor. At the time there was a widely reported “fall in the intensity of labor” in 1919-1923,296 which
hurt productivity. However, what was good for the average man was that during the inflation, rents fell on an
inflation adjusted basis to almost zero. This was obviously bad for those who owned rental properties.
The inflation and negative real interest rates encouraged borrowing to invest as well as to spend. Real
investment was at least as high as before the war.297 The inflation stimulated a demand for “producers” goods
because they were viewed as having relatively long income producing lives with these incomes tied to prices in
the future (i.e., they were considered good inflation hedges). This market action is typical in high inflation
environments. Similarly, it was widely recognized that short-term bank credits could be used to make long-term
investments because, thanks to the increase of prices, the debtor could repay with depreciated money. It was
thought that even if for the time being the new equipment was not utilized, it had an “intrinsic value”. Similarly,
at that time, the savings of entrepreneurs who readily adapted their behavior to make money went into tangible
assets such as iron and stones. Also, to avoid the effects of the monetary depreciation, those in German
agriculture continued to buy machines. The “flight from the mark to the machine”, as it was called at the time,
was one of the most convenient means of defense against the depreciation of the currency. Of course, those
forms of investment were excessive and eventually did badly. For example, towards the end of the inflation,
farmers realized that a great part of their capital was sunk in machines that were far more numerous than they
needed.298
Those whose wealth was in fixed value monetary assets (e.g., bonds) and who did not learn to protect it by
shifting into real assets or by contracting equivalent debts suffered devastating losses.
During the inflation, all companies, with rare exceptions, continually increased their capital299 by borrowing
because one of the rules of good management during these inflationary times was to take on as much debt as
possible because debts could be repaid with depreciated currency. At that time, smart investors were buyers of
shares, firms, securities, and merchandise—i.e., they were buyers of tangible rather than financial wealth.300 So,

there was a big shift by capitalists toward producing “goods for production” rather than “goods for
consumption”, and toward getting “short money” via borrowing. Of course, those who provided these goods
demanded very high prices for them, so there was a more rapid increase in prices of producers’ good than in
those of consumers’ goods.
Another reason for the high investment rates was to minimize taxes. By investing profits back in capital goods
businesses could create expenses to lower their reported profits to escape onerous taxes.
At times of rapid depreciation of the mark, such as in the autumn of 1921, the stock market rose sharply.301
Speculation in stocks was popular as a currency/inflation hedge, and became rampant at the time. A newspaper
at the time wrote, “Today there is no one—from lift-boy, typist, and small landlord to the wealth lady in high
society—who does not speculate in industrial securities and who does not study the list of official quotations as if
it were a most precious letter.”302
Because stocks were driven by the value of money/currency at the time (in 1920-1921), prices of industrial
shares stopped being a good barometer of economic activity. In fact, the opposite was true—events which were
unfavorable to Germany caused a fresh depreciation of the mark which caused a rise in the prices of industrial
securities.303
From mid-1920 through the end of 1921 share prices responded to the fluctuations in the value of the currency304
and nearly tripled in inflation adjusted terms. In the autumn of 1921, the mark collapsed and a fresh spurt in
exports occurred.305
Then, in the first months of 1922, there was a relative stabilization of the mark. At the time, German exports
were less than German imports. That is because exports consisted mainly of primary products, so when the
exchange rate fell, the beneficial effects of increased exports were offset by the negative effects of rising import
prices. So mark weakness hurt sectors such as food, drink and tobacco whose outputs were sold at home but
whose raw material inputs were purchased abroad. Many people at the time believed that the real stimulus that
arose from the mark’s decline was from the inflation that came substantially as a result of the fall in real interest
rates306 that led to inflation hedge buying.
Germany ran a large trade deficit between 1919 and 1922, though quantifying it is not possible for that period
because of the difficulty of ascertaining correct gold-mark valuations of the trade flows. Still, we know that the
deficit was big. Estimates vary from 4.5 to 11 billion gold marks which equaled 12% to 28% of GDP. On top of
that deficit Germany had to come up with 2.6 billion gold marks worth of cash reparations payments, which
equaled 6.7% of GDP. While a small surplus might have been earned on invisible account during those years
(chiefly from tourism) it was very small, so the sum of the trade deficit plus reparations represents the order of
magnitude of the current account deficit which appears to be somewhere between 11% and 17% of GDP!!307
Though we don’t know what it was exactly, we know that it was huge.
How did this get funded? It was funded by foreign countries, mostly via individual investors who were lured by
higher German interest rates. They accumulated substantial paper-mark claims on Germany throughout the
1914-1922 period. So Germany became a debtor to other countries’ investors with the debt largely denominated
in its own currency. The table below shows estimated Weimar Germany balance of payments numbers.

It’s estimated that foreigners transferred capital to Germany to the amount of 15.7 billion gold marks over the
period 1914-22 as a whole. J.M. Keynes and K. Singer estimated the unrequited resource transfer into Germany
between 1919 and 1922 at between eight and ten billion gold marks. So Germany essentially borrowed money
from private foreigners and in turn used the money it borrowed to pay foreign government reparations—so it was
essentially a Ponzi scheme.308 While it looked like Germany was both making its reparation payments and
providing investors with high returns, these payments came from borrowing money from foreigners. This is very
much like the carry trade dynamic that was very popular in 2004-2007.
Foreigners also bought industrial or bank shares, houses, and, and in a lesser degree, land because prices were so
low309 and the economy gave the appearance of being prosperous because it was relatively strong due to its
large borrowings. So these capital flows helped to fill the gap.
As long as foreigners were willing to invest funds in marks, they also helped to keep the German currency from
being weaker than it would have otherwise been. This was the case from February 1920 to May 1921, the period
when the mark was fairly stable on the foreign exchanges despite a nearly fifty percent growth of the highpowered money stock. Between 1919 and 1923 Germany transferred 2.6 billion gold marks in cash to the Allies.
However, this ended up being only one third of what foreigners lost through the depreciation of their German
bank balances.310 Foreign investors in Germany, especially in German debt, ended up losing huge amounts of
money. For example, foreign (non-German) losses on debt due to depreciation were estimated at between
seven and eight billion gold marks.311
In 1921 the average inflation rate was 140%, the real growth rate was 8.6%, M0 growth was 51% the mark fell by
163% and the real stock market rose by approximately 13% in US dollar terms and 75% relative to domestic
prices.

Hyperinflation

January 1922- November 1923
First Half of 1922: The Transition to Hyperinflation
The stock market crashes; foreigners pull out of investments; mark depreciation accelerates; liquidity
crisis; Reichsbank prints money and makes loans directly to the private sector…
In 1922, as the rate of price increases accelerated towards hyperinflation, there was a labor scarcity that drove
the unemployment rate below one percent.
As inflation became hyperinflation, the currency weakness started to hurt the economy rather than to help it and
stocks no longer seemed like a viable hedge against inflation. Also, in January the allies imposed fiscal restraints
on Germany. Instead of there being a high correlation between the exchange rate of the dollar and the price of
shares, there was an increasing divergence between share prices and the exchange rate.
Foreigners pulled out in 1922, which caused a liquidity crisis, which led to the central bank to print the money to
ease the crisis, which led to an increase in inflation. This is a classic dynamic of debtor countries when they
experience foreign capital withdrawals and economic weakness at the same time. In other words, when money
leaves a country, (typically when foreign and domestic investors fear that they will lose money in debt
instruments due to a credit crisis being accommodated by the central bank aggressively providing liquidity
typically to fund growing budget deficits), the central bank is forced to choose between tighter money and
printing money. As the economy is weak and credit is already tight, there really is no choice.312
As shown in the chart that follows, late in 1H22, the velocity of money accelerated, the mark depreciated,
inflation rose and M0 growth increased to accommodate this increased demand for cash.

In the spring of 1922, when foreigners’ willingness to hold mark bank balances declined, this caused an acute
liquidity crisis. Because such crises generally lead to bank and business collapses, in July 1922, the Reichsbank
began to increase the supply of central bank money by stepping up its discounting of private bills. So the shift
from inflation into hyper-inflation during 1922 was due to the decreased willingness of foreign and domestic
investors to lend in marks, and the response of the central bank to replace this lost capital with printed currency
312

At this point German investors were subjected to foreign exchange controls and legislation against capital
flight.313
In January 1922, a deal was cut in which the Allies granted a reparations moratorium in exchange for a halt to
Germany’s printing of money and stabilizing its exchange rate. Consistent with this deal, increasing taxes and
cutting expenditures were demanded as the means of balancing the Reich’s budget. Also, the allies required that
the Reichsbank be made autonomous, in the hope of stiffening its resistance to the Reich’s demands for credit.
The German side accepted these conditions.
After the ominous “Black Thursday” (December 1, 1921), shell shocked investors realized that not even the
purchase of shares was a safe means of investing their savings, so stocks fell. By October 1922, the stock market
index was at its lowest level since 1914.
The enormous drop in share prices that started in December 1921 caused stocks to become extremely cheap by
late 1922. One example that is given is that all the share capital of Daimler was worth a value of 327 cars though
it had “considerable plant and equipment, an extensive area of land, its reserves and its liquid capital, and its
commercial organization developed in Germany and abroad.”
In this 1921/1922 bear market, shareholders lost 75% on their investments. The table below shows equity shares
against goods prices, conveying shareholders’ real losses, even though nominal prices rose. As shown, the
currency (i.e., mark) declined and wholesale prices increased by similar amounts, the total cost of living index
rose by a bit less, shares rose by considerably less and M0 rose by even less. This reflects the fact that the
increase in M0 was not the cause of the inflation and the currency depreciation, but rather was due to money
supply being increased to accommodate the higher inflation and currency depreciation. In other words, a selfreinforcing inflationary cycle developed in which the increased needs for money were accommodated by the
central bank printing more, which led to currency weakness, higher inflation and less capital going into credit,
which created more demand for money, which the central bank accommodated.

In the period of relative stabilization of the exchange, which occurred in the first months of 1922, the recovery of
the national finances made some progress as the German Government adopted some financial measures to
reduce expenditures. But confidence in the mark, which the event of September 1921 had profoundly shaken,
could not be re-established.
After June 1922, a new wave of pessimism swept over Germany. German speculation renewed its attacks
against the mark, which once again suffered a sharp fall. The number of people who positioned themselves to

benefit from a continuous depreciation of the mark increased continually in Germany. Not only the great
industries and the large merchant firms, but also numerous classes of investors, hoarded foreign bills or currency,
which they bought with borrowed marks. Investors also wanted to escape the mark and the government’s
confiscatory taxes so anyone who had wealth invested it in foreign currencies, bills, securities, etc., which were
easily concealed. The “flight of capital,” which in Germany became a ‘”mass phenomenon” that restrictions did
not succeed in stopping, continually removed a huge amount of taxable wealth from Germany. Producers
protected themselves by forcing their customers to pay in foreign money, or to pay amounts in paper marks
which were computed at the rate of the day on which the producer could convert them into foreign money. The
retail trader at that time tried to protect himself by fixing a basic price in gold marks or dollars which he
converted into paper marks at the daily rate.

The disequilibrium between the demand and supply of foreign bills was the result of the following factors:
(a) Having little faith in the political and economic future of Germany and desiring to avoid taxes, German
industrialists left abroad a part of the profits from exports; that is, the difference between the cost of production
and the price which they received by selling abroad.
(b) A lot of the foreign money which was obtained by German sales to foreigners of securities, houses, land, etc.,
was either left abroad (the “flight of capital”) or hoarded at home, so that it did not come on to the exchange
market.
(c) The numerous laws that prohibited the buying of foreign exchange helped to lessen the supply of it because
the possessor of foreign exchange would not give it up at any price, fearing that he would be unable to repurchase it later when the need arose.
(d) A brisk demand for foreign exchange on the part of the German possessors of paper marks. More and more,
as the mark depreciated the phenomenon was understood by the public and the mark ceased to be wanted as a
“store of value.”
(e) As depreciation progressed, the mark became unfit as a medium of exchange. For example, the practice of
calculating prices in foreign money became widespread in the second half of 1922 because it was more practical.
The chart below shows how the exchange rate’s depreciation outpaced wholesale price increases, which
outpaced the cost of living increases, which outpaced both M0 growth and stock price increases, from May 1922
through December 1922. As explained, that was because capital flows out of marks were accommodated by
money growth in a self-reinforcing inflationary spiral—and not because money growth pushed prices higher.

The price movements of stocks are shown below. As shown by either measure, the real stock price fell by 80%
to 90% from the end of the war in 1918 until mid-1920. Then inflation adjusted prices doubled to quadrupled
(depending on which measure you use). Then inflation adjusted prices plunged to new lows in late 1922. Then in
1923, they rose by a factor of four or five. Imagine these whipsaws and what it must have been like to navigate
through them.

It was clear that Germany’s reparations debt needed to be restructured so a conference to explore how to do this
occurred in Cannes in January 1922. The allies demanded that Germany stabilize its public finances by bringing
its revenues and expenditures toward balance as the precondition for a reparations moratorium.314 Finally on
March 9, 1922, a compromise was concluded between the parties and authorization was given to the
Government to impose a forced loan of a billion gold marks. This was executed in July 1922, when the wealthy
classes were forced to make a “loan” to the government. However, they secured the right to make this loan
payable in paper marks because there was no other viable means of making payment. This scared investors who
were afraid of having their wealth confiscated, and because this fiscal tightening would certainly hurt economic
growth. This development hurt the stock market and briefly stabilized the mark between March and May 1922.315
For example, on the Berlin foreign exchange market the dollar exchange rate averaged 284.19 marks in March,
291.00 in April, 290.11 in May and, on June 9, 289.25. But it also caused businesses to suffer from illiquidity. The
demands for bank credit increased as an attempt to raise liquidity by businesses. However, since at the same
time the flow of funds to the banks fell, their own liquidity declined. At the same time the structure of their
deposit liabilities shifted rapidly towards shorter term because depositors didn’t want to grant longer term credit
because they also were worried about their liquidity. So this increased bank liquidity risks. Banks in Germany
were desperate for liquidity. In June, the Reparations Commission postponed consideration of loans to Germany
until after a revision of reparations claims. That was the proverbial “straw that broke the camel’s back”—i.e., it
dashed hopes of an early stabilization of the mark which destroyed foreigners' willingness to accept payment in
marks or to buy mark-denominated securities.316
Once foreigners were no longer prepared to buy German securities or real estate, and/or once the depreciation
of the mark had so reduced the real value of these balances that they no longer mattered, this source of
refinancing dried up. Then the choice was between extreme illiquidity and printing money at an accelerating
rate, and the path was again obvious – i.e., to print. Then, since no one wanted to hold on to the currency in this
rapidly depreciating inflationary environment, the velocity of money accelerated.317 A rapidly accelerating
velocity with rapid growth in the money supply is a classic sign of an inflationary deleveraging. This point was
reached in spring 1922. At this point the mark and domestic prices entered the hyperinflationary phase.

The economy’s demand for credit intensified as price and cost increases accelerated and the central bank
satisfied them by printing money as credit growth collapsed. In June and July 1922, the supply of bank credit
reached a standstill as saving through this medium dried up. In fact, savings banks actually experienced a decline
in the nominal value of their savings deposits during July as investors did not see savings deposits as a viable
option. The Reichsbank tried to encourage commercial bills as a way of supplying business with the liquidity
which it did by discounting such bills and by a propaganda campaign in the press.
With credit from banks no longer available to businesses, the Reichsbank was faced with the classic choice all
central banks in this situation face—to either allow illiquidity to cause businesses to collapse or to allow
businesses to have direct access to the central bank’s credit facilities. The latter alternative was not necessarily
more inflationary than the former because the central bank giving money to businesses directly wasn’t much
different from the central bank giving it to the banks to give to the businesses. And, there was no doubt that the
liquidity had to be provided. In fact, since evidence of illiquidity intensified the domestic and foreign flight from
the currency as investors wanted to run from default risks, it was argued that providing the liquidity to
businesses directly (because the banks were ill-equipped to provide it) would help to stabilize the situation. At
the time, the higher inflation rate raised government expenditures faster than tax revenues. As long as the rising
domestic price level kept raising the paper mark value of government domestic expenditures, and as long as the
falling exchange rate kept raising the paper mark value of reparations obligations, and as long as the Reichsbank
continued to finance the Reich budget deficit without restraint, there was no liquidity crisis to have a
counterinflationary effect, so the spiral accelerated.318
There was some talk about the allies relieving Germany of some of the reparations burden. But on June 10, 1922
the mark rate broke when the Reparations Commission chaired by J.P. Morgan made public its refusal to
recommend long-term foreign lending to Germany until her reparation liabilities had been adjusted to her
capacity to pay.319 Then depreciation turned into hyperinflation.
It was impossible to squeeze each year from the German people two billion gold marks, plus a sum equivalent to
26% of the value of exports,320 so something had to be done. The British representative on the Reparations
Commission proposed something similar to the Brady Restructuring of debt in 1991—i.e., that the German
government should make its payment in the form of treasury certificates with a five year term and the Allied
governments should place these on the market, adding their own guarantee to them. In this way Germany would
defer its 1923 and 1924 reparation payments for five years.321 In July 1922 reparation payments in foreign
exchange were suspended. In spite of this, the depreciation of the German exchange continued.322

Second Half of 1922
Liquidity crisis, Reichsbank policy, and monetary factors in the transition to hyperinflation…
The spiral accelerated in 2H1922. The sudden rise in prices caused an intense demand for cash. At the same
time the government’s need of money increased rapidly. Private banks, faced with withdrawals, found it
practically impossible to meet the demand for money, so it had to ration the cashing of checks presented to
them. On some days, they had to suspend payments or open their offices for a few hours only. Naturally this
caused panic, especially among the industrial and commercial classes who were no longer in a position to fulfill
their contracts because of their cash shortages. Private checks were refused because it became known that the
banks would be unable to cash them. Business stopped. The panic spread to the working classes when they
learned that their employers did not have the cash with which to pay their wages.323

As credit was non-existent, money had to be produced to replace it and, as rapid money growth caused inflation,
people didn’t want to hold on to cash, so the velocity accelerated as cash was exchanged like a hot potato. As
one economist on the time described it, “It was clear then that to stop the printing press would mean that in a
very short time the entire public, and above all the Reich, could no longer pay merchants, employees, or workers.
In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railways and post office, national and local
government, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped.”324
The government increased salaries in proportion to the depreciation of the mark, and employers in turn granted
continual increases in wages, to avoid disputes, on the condition that they could raise the prices of their
products. As is normal in such cases of prices and wage indexing, a vicious circle was established: the exchange
depreciated; internal prices rose; note-issues were increased; the increase of the quantity of paper money
lowered once more the value of the mark in terms of gold; prices rose once more; and so on.325
Meanwhile, banks continued to have a shortage of cash to meet withdrawals.326
However, as alternative forms of money emerged, and the velocity of money accelerated, the real supply of
money fell. Towards the end of 1922 this real value of currency in circulation had become less than the value of
the gold reserve of the Reichsbank. Similarly, in certain other countries, where the legal currency in circulation
fell to very low levels, the gold cover of the notes (the gold being valued according to the foreign exchange), was
much greater than in countries where the currency depreciation had not gone to such lengths.
During 1922, the management of the Reichsbank tenaciously refused to allow the gold reserve to be used for
monetary reform.327 Throughout this period the Reichsbank continued to finance government deficits by
accepting Reich treasury bills. In fact, as the demand for Treasury bills shrank, the percentage held outside the
Reichsbank fell, signaling the final failures of all credit instruments as a storehold of wealth, hence the
hyperinflation.328
The chart below shows how the role of private banks fell from 1920 to 1923 as banks were faced with liquidity
problems and the Reichsbank replaced it by lending directly. Until the summer of 1922 the Reichsbank exercised,
almost exclusively, the function of a State bank, discounting Treasury bills presented to it. The increasing needs
of trade were satisfied by private banks which could discount directly at the Reichsbank the Treasury bills in
which they had largely invested the money of depositors during and after the war.329

As mentioned, in July of 1922 the Reichsbank began to supply liquidity to businesses—i.e., the Reichsbank
allowed big businesses to borrow via commercial bills, which the Reichsbank discounted at a much lower rate
than the rate of the depreciation of the mark and even lower than the rates charged by private banks, so
essentially a subsidized rate. As a result, these companies could borrow on terms that were essentially the same
as the Reich. They even had direct access to the Reichsbank. These moves were quite similar to recent moves
by the Fed and motivated by similar reasons.
The official discount rate in Germany remained fixed at 5% from 1915 until July 1922, so as inflation rose, real
interest rates fell to very negative levels. The discount rate was raised to 6% at the end of July, to 7% at the end
of August, to 8% on September 21, to 10% on November 13, to 12% on January 18, 1923, and to 18% in the last
week of April 1923. However, these rates of interest were still all much less than the rate of depreciation in the
value of money so they didn’t dissuade the borrowing and other shorting of marks. So inflation hedge assets and
other currencies continued to rise. For example, a gold mark was worth 160 paper marks at the end of July 1922,
411 paper marks at the end of August, 1,822 at the end of November, and 7,100 at the end of April 1923.330
However, as conveyed in the following chart, these increases in interest rates were the beginning of a major
increase in rates that occurred in 1923.

While the liquidity of the banking system was high during the inflation since money itself was generally so
plentiful, in 1922 this changed when a crisis of liquidity at the banks accompanied hyperinflation. See the table
that follows. Note how deposits as a percent of the monetary base fell sharply and continuously at banks except
for the Joint Stock banks in Berlin.

As inflation worsened, bank depositors understandably wanted to be able to get their funds on short notice so
they shortened their lending to banks. This is reflected in the following tables331 which show how over 90% of
bank deposits were for seven days or less in 1922-1923 and how over 80% of deposits moved to short-term
checking accounts rather than longer-term savings. During inflationary deleveragings, average maturities of debt
always fall, so this is typical.

Also, because it had become impractical to transact in marks, foreign currency (especially dollars) replaced the
mark as the means of settlement of large transactions, though small transactions continued to be in marks. The
economic situation in October 1922, was described by the newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung: "German economic life
is now dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark: is it to remain the German currency, or is it doomed
to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of account in domestic
transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars, especially, has established itself,
not only in firms' internal accounting practice, but above all as the method of price quotation in trade, industry
and agriculture."332 This discussion of the prospects for the mark concludes by emphasizing the degree to which
foreign currencies also served as "stores of value", used to protect the real value of money balances.

On October 12, 1922, strictly enforced limits were put on FX purchases making transactions impractical,
essentially eliminating foreign currencies as an alternative. Investors who were investing their available
resources in foreign exchange to escape inflation once again had to turn to the share market. The shift from
foreign money to stocks arising from the decree of October 12 was obvious in that it caused a heavy fall in the
supply of foreign exchange333 and a rise in stock prices suddenly in the second half of October. This dynamic
was similar to the frenzied bull speculation in the autumn of 1921.
One of the most important drivers of hyperinflation in the second half of 1922 was wage indexation because it
produced a wage-cost spiral. In the second half of 1922, the resistance of the workers to reductions in their real
wages increased. The working classes sought to re-establish the earlier level of real wages and to keep them
stable, so wages were often indexed to inflation. As a result, the profits which entrepreneurs334 derived from real
wages falling evaporated. As the chart below shows, the real wage declines that occurred in 1921 to late 1922,
ended in late 1922 at levels that were down 50% to 75% from pre-war levels, and shot up in 1923.

While the inflation had a devastating effect on the wealth of debt and equity holders and it slashed real wages to
workers, it generally helped agile entrepreneurs and the owners of material means of production and
strengthened the positions of industrial capitalists.335 But it was terrible for productivity. For example, the
entrepreneur, instead of concentrating his attention on improving the product and reducing his costs often
became a speculator in goods and foreign exchanges.

1923
The Occupation of the Ruhr
To make matters worse, on January 11, 1923 France and Belgium occupied Germany’s Ruhr valley to capture the
German coal, iron and steel production in the Ruhr area. This was supposedly done to gain the money that
Germany owed in reparations. France had the iron ore and Germany had coal to make steel, so there had been a
history of tensions related to their trade that exacerbated the problem. This aggressive act was a classic case of
a debtor/creditor/trading relationship turning antagonistic. This occupation caused the stock market and the
currency to plunge. But the currency plunge and the hyper-inflation became so severe that they drove nominal
stock prices up. The stock index number of shares increased from 8,981 in December 1922 to 22,400 in January

1923, and to 45,200 in February.336 It’s a good example of how a bearish development can be so negative for a
country’s currency that it can cause nominal stock prices to rise.
A pause in the mark’s decline occurred when the Reichsbank began its policy of supporting the mark by imposing
an artificial exchange rate that linked the mark to the dollar.337 It did this by issuing its first dollar-denominated
treasury certificates. The dollars raised were to be employed by the Reichsbank in an attempt to stabilize the
exchange rate. The Reichsbank pledged abroad a good part of the one billion gold marks’ worth of gold reserves
with which it had started 1923 in order to obtain the requisite foreign exchange for the support action. This
“stabilization action” succeeded between February and April. But that policy finished unsuccessfully, as all fixed
exchange rates that are pegged inconsistent with the fundamentals inevitably do. That is because the Reich’s
floating debt rose from 2.1 to 6.6 trillion marks between the end of January and March and the acquiring of
further foreign credits reduced Germany’s gold reserves to under 500 million gold marks (by the end of 1923).
German also had silver stocks—which were not explicitly shown in the Bank’s Statements—largely lost in the
same period. So in the second half of April 1923, the mark fell again.
It was estimated that this early 1923 failed currency defense cost more than three hundred million gold marks.
This defense was abandoned and the dollar rate soared.
There was also a very big redistribution of wealth, from high income earners to low income earners. The next
table shows how the distribution of wealth shifted from 1913 to 1923. It conveys that it was not the middle
income earners and moderate wealth holders who were affected the most severely by the postwar redistributive
processes; it was exclusively the upper income groups. Their losses had less to do with taxes (which did have an
adverse affect because they were based on the individual’s ability to pay) than with the effect of inflation on the
value of the capital assets the wealthy held to store their wealth. The table and charts below show this
redistribution of wealth.

The first table above indicates that at December 31, 1923, taxable wealth was more equally distributed than it
had been ten years earlier. It also shows that the two lowest wealth classes virtually doubled their share of
aggregate wealth, the middle categories increased their share of the total, and the classes above these fell. The
second table also indicates that over this ten year period the aggregate value of wealth declined by 61.2%, which
was much greater than the 25-30% fall in real national income between 1913 and 1923. That is because (a) the
income from capital and (b) the value of capital became a smaller proportion of national income.
The period of most acute and widespread poverty was 1923. Not coincidently, it was also the year of the highest
crime rate. Plunderings and riots became common. To cope with the social unrest which the collapse of the
mark had caused, the Reich declared a state of siege on September 27, 1923.338
By mid-1923, people were eager for some cash-like vehicle to hold their liquidity in. New forms of credit were
invented and desperation made some of them work. In the summer of 1923, when the scarcity of money was
most acute, the Berlin banks decided to issue a kind of check which was to be acceptable at their branches and
which was also willingly accepted by the public, who were desirous of having any means of payment whatever.
Private firms, industrial companies, combines, and public authorities issued all kinds of provisional money. This
was very similar to what happened in other inflationary deleveragings like when the banks became dysfunctional
such as in Argentina.
In August 1923, the value of foreign currencies employed in transactions within Germany was almost ten times
as great as the value of the paper-mark circulation.339 So the currency was essentially defunct and all debt
denominated in it was extinguished—i.e., marks no longer served a meaningful purpose of either a medium of
exchange and as a store of wealth.
In an attempt to satisfy the desperate demand for value-maintaining means of payment, the Reich brought out a
five hundred million gold mark loan in August 1923. It was issued in notes of small denomination so that they
could be used as means of payment. To support the value of these, the Reich also issued exchange-rate linked
treasury certificates—i.e., certificates whose value was effectively denominated in dollars pegged to the dollar
exchange rate. The Reich also permitted provinces, municipalities, chambers of commerce and large business
firms to issue emergency money denominated in gold marks. Also, some companies borrowed by issuing “loans
at a stable value” which were tied to what they produced—e.g., rye farmers issue rye-backed debt.
Because it was impossible to do accounting for, and convey the meaning of, money because its value changed so
fast, the accounting system was changed and the practice of valuing things in gold became generally adopted.

Naturally, there was the almost complete disappearance of bankruptcies in the advanced phases of the
inflationary monetary depreciation because debts were easily paid off with paper money.
During the hyperinflation the prices of equity shares generally were determined by investors on the basis of the
“intrinsic value” of the companies rather than as multiples on earnings. In the last phase of the inflation (i.e. in
1923), there was a tendency to overvalue shares. Then, after the stabilization of the mark, the prices of shares
declined rapidly. The average quotation for December 1923 was 26.9 (1913 = 100).

Final Stages of Inflation…
In the summer of 1923, when the mark was losing value rapidly everybody tried to get rid of marks as soon as
they received them. They also tried to short them by borrowing them and converting them into foreign exchange
and hard assets. The increase in the velocity of the money in circulation was the expression of the fact that the
population lived from day to day without keeping any cash reserves. For example, in Germany it was rare for a
retailer or workman to have cash balances that were greater than necessary for two or three days’ needs.340
The risk of transactions affected by payment in paper marks became so great in the summer of 1923 that many
producers and merchants preferred not to sell at all rather than to accept money for goods. Some just made their
prices so high that people refused to buy the merchandise. In fact, prices in October and November of 1923 were
so high that a stoppage of sales was the norm. Business and great shops were deserted. As a result, the
personnel who worked in these stores were let go or given less work hours. The drop in sales resulted in a fall in
working capital, so production ceased and unemployment increased.
The depreciation of the currency in the early stages stimulated production, but in the late phase it acted as a
serious obstacle to production because of the chaos it caused. When the currency depreciation and inflation
caused economic collapse instead of economic support, stabilization of the currency became essential.
Ironically, because of both the acceleration in the velocity of money and because it became dysfunctional as a
medium of exchange, in August 1923 the value of the paper money in circulation declined to scarcely 80 million
gold marks.341 By this time, the total circulation of “value-maintaining paper money” had grown in excess of the
value of paper marks and of various non-value-maintaining moneys in circulation during the final phase of the
inflation.
In the summer of 1923, the price of the dollar jumped in the course of a few days to 1, 2, and then 5 million paper

The evidence shows that the cause of this hyperinflation was described at the time. The following are good
descriptions of this dynamic:
Helfferich (economist)
“The depreciation of the German mark in terms of foreign currencies was caused by the excessive burdens thrust
on to Germany and by the policy of violence adopted by France; the increase of the prices of all imported goods
was caused by the depreciation of the exchanges; then followed the general increase of internal prices and of
wages, the increased need for means of circulation on the part of the public and of the State, greater demands on
the Reichsbank by private business and the State and the increase of the paper mark issues. Contrary to the
widely held conception, not inflation but the depreciation of the mark was the beginning of this chain of cause and
effect; inflation is not the cause of the increase of prices and of the depreciation of the mark; but the depreciation
of the mark is the cause of the increase of prices and of the paper mark issues. The decomposition of the
German monetary system has been the primary and decisive cause of the financial collapse.”343
‘Authoritative Writer’ from German Press
“Since the summer of 1921 the foreign exchange rate has lost all connection with the internal inflation. The
increase of the floating debt, which represents the creation by the State of new purchasing-power, follows at
some distance the depreciation of the mark…Furthermore, the level of internal prices is not determined by the
paper inflation or credit inflation, but exclusively by the depreciation of the mark in terms of foreign
currencies…To tell the truth, the astonishing thing is not the great quantity but the small quantity of money which
circulates in Germany, a quantity extraordinarily small from a relative point of view; even more surprising is it
that the floating debt has not increased much more rapidly.”344
Government Report
“The fundamental cause of the dislocation of the German monetary system is the disequilibrium of the balance of
payments. The disturbance of the national finances and the inflation are in their turn the consequences of the
depreciation of the currency. The depreciation of the currency upset the Budget balance, and determined with an
inevitable necessity a divergence between income and expenditure, which provoked the upheaval.”

Our examinations of other cases of hyperinflationary periods show that these causes are typical—i.e., that
countries with large debts, especially large foreign debts, high dependencies on foreign capital, credit problems
and large and growing budget deficits, are much more prone to experience capital flight and currency
depreciation, faster monetary base growth, and high inflation rates than countries with balance of payments
surpluses.345

Stabilization: From Late 1923 Onward
Now that we’ve seen how this inflationary deleveraging came about, let’s see how it was extinguished. By late
1923 virtually all debts were extinguished by inflation, and there was a great deal of betting on inflation and being
short the mark.
Starting in August 1923 there was a feverish attempt to devise a new currency or stabilize the old one. The plans
for stabilizing the currency fell into three groups.
(1) Plans to use taxation policy, a ban on credit, and restrictions on foreign-currency holdings.
Along these lines, in August 1923 the government introduced an “index-linked” tax assessment,
it issued “value-maintaining loans”, it sought to acquire foreign-currency holdings, and it urged
banks and the Reichsbank to offer their clients gold-mark accounts, i.e., accounts in which the
borrower promises to calculate the value based on the price of gold.
(2) Plans to return to a gold currency.
(3) Plans to secure the currency by mortgaging of land or commodities.346
On August 14, 1923, the government passed a law that created a Gold Loan of 500 million gold marks. This law
contained only this promise: “In order to guarantee the payment of interest and the redemption of the loan of
500 million gold marks, the Government of the Reich is authorized, if the ordinary receipts do not provide
sufficient cover, to raise supplements to the tax on capital…” The word “wert-bestandig” which meant “stablevalue” was written on the new paper money. And the public accepted and hoarded these notes. In other word,
the gold loans seemed to be believed and thus created a vehicle for financial savings. The German monetary law
of August 30, 1924, fixed the conversion rate of the new Reichsmark (whose weight in fine gold was equal to that
of the old mark) at one trillion paper marks.347
Creating a new currency with very hard backing, and phasing out the old currency, is the most classic path that
countries that are suffering from inflationary deleveragings follow in order to end them. On October 15, a decree
was issued which instituted a new money, the rentenmark, to begin from November 15, 1923. The key was to
issue very little of it and to have it be backed by gold. At this time the money supply was so reduced by the
abandonment of marks—e.g., the total amount of floating debt was only 200 million gold marks—that creating a
real backing was possible. Towards the end of October 1923 the total sum of paper marks issued in Germany
equaled scarcely 150 million gold marks, so they were essentially out of circulation. Going to new currencies
with hard currency on gold backings is a classic step in inflationary deleveragings to bring about stability. The
chart below shows the monetary base in dollars fell to equal Germany’s gold reserves in dollars in 1923.

The government chose to make the gold value of the new currency identical to that of the prewar mark. Also the
government imposed a credit limit of 1.2 billion marks on the new bank’s dealings with the private sector—not
least in order not to make the Reichsbank wholly redundant—and it reduced the ceiling on credit to the Reich to
1.2 billion marks as well. The “Currency Bank” became the “Rentenbank” and the “rye mark” became the
“rentenmark”.348 The “rentenmark experiment”—i.e., this move to a new, gold-backed currency—met with
astounding success. Since the new currency was identical to the former national gold currency, and the
government did almost everything in its power to ensure that its value remained stable, it maintained its value.
The new currency was almost completely stable from the outset.
The old currency lost its value and the disappeared. The dollar was worth 160,000 paper marks on July 3, 1923,
on the Berlin Bourse, 13 million on September 4, and 420 billion on November 20. From then onwards the
exchange rate of the dollar remained stable; so also did the ratio of the value between the new rentenmark and
the dollar (1 dollar – 4.2 rentenmarks). During 1924 the German and Austrian exchanges were the most stable in
Europe.349
It was not the decree of the October 15, 1923, but the monetary law of August 30, 1924 (which became effective
on October 11, 1924) which sanctioned the legal reduction of the value of the paper mark.350
“The miracle of the rentenmark” became a common expression because the improvement occurred so rapidly
that people could not easily find an explanation for it.351
Some economists attribute the success of the German monetary reform to discontinuing the issuance of paper
marks, strict limitations of the quantity of the new money, and the calling-in of paper marks in proportion to the
issues of new money. Also, on November 16 the discounting of Treasury bills by the Reichsbank was stopped.
However, the issuing of paper money for commercial purposes continued after November 16. At that date the
quantity of paper marks in circulation amount to 93 million trillion. By November 30 it had already passed 400
million trillion, it reached 496 million trillion on December 31, 690 million trillion on March 31, 1924, 927 million
trillion on May 31, and 1,211 million trillion on July 31. At the same time the issues of new rentenmarks increased,

and their circulation amounted to 501 million on November 30, 1923, 1,049 million on December 31, 1,760 million
on March 31, 1924, and 1,803 million on July 31.352
So the introduction of the new currency rentenmark occurred with old marks still in circulation so it was
accompanied “by the most colossal monetary inflation ever recorded in the history of the world” in old-mark
terms, while the rentenmark was stable. This currency stability might have been due to other countries
experiencing similar rapid increases in their money supplies.353
Of course, with the abandonment of the old currency, accounting laws had to be changed. On December 28,
1923, a decree compelled industrial companies to compile new balance sheets, valuing their assets and liabilities
in “gold marks”. With 500 rentenmarks one could obtain at any moment a bond with the nominal value of 500
gold marks, which was guaranteed by a legal mortgage on German property and which yielded a rate of interest
at 5 percent in gold (actually payable in paper at the exchange rate of the gold mark.)354
Of course, the stability of the value of the rentenmark could not have been due to the possibility of converting the
currency into mortgage securities because, at the time, the market value of the mortgage bonds was lower than
the nominal value and the market rate of interest was much higher than 5 percent. During 1924 the prices of
“stable-value loans” yielded an effective interest of as much as 15-20%. And of course, issuing more
rentenmarks would add to the Government’s burden on interest on mortgage bonds, for which the public would
exchange increasing quantities of rentenmarks.355 However, as shown in the chart on page 26, interest rates
were raised dramatically which changed the economics of borrowing and lending in marks. The lack of
confidence in the paper mark gradually lessened and, as a result, consumers, producers, and merchants ceased
to be preoccupied with the necessity of reducing their holdings of paper marks to a minimum. As a result, after
the stabilization of the mark exchange in November 1923, the velocity of paper mark circulation declined. In
other words, the money supply could rise and velocity could drop because of increased confidence in marks for
saving.
At the same time the Reichsbank energetically set about eliminating the illegal emergency monies from
circulation. The government also fixed wages.356
As the mark gained credibility as a medium of exchange, foreign currencies were turned in for it. This showed up
in the balance sheets of the Reichsbank, which showed a continuous and noticeable rise in the item “other
assets,” in which, as experts know, was that foreign exchange. According to the balance sheets of the
Reichsbank, “other assets” amounted to 18.8 million gold marks on November 15, 1923, 285.8 million on January
7, 1924, 702.3 million on June 30, and 1,183 million on October 31, 1924.357 It also appears that those who were
short it in various forms got squeezed, adding to the upward pressure on it.
Nonetheless, the stability of the German exchange rate gave way in February and March 1924 as the credit policy
of the Reichsbank was not strict enough, and symptoms of a new “inflation” appeared in the first quarter of
1924.358 However, on April 7, 1924, the Reichsbank, now convinced that it was heading for a fresh inflation,
which would cause a new depreciation of the paper mark and the rentenmark, decided to restrict credit severely,
which worked. The shortage of marks caused a supply of hoarded foreign exchange to come to the market for
sale for marks. At the same time the demand for foreign exchange on the Berlin Bourse declined considerably.359

The decree of February 14, 1924, “revalued” some debts i.e., required debtors to give creditors more than their
face value. For example, debentures and mortgages were revalued at about 15 percent of their original gold
value. Mortgage bonds, savings bank deposits, and obligations arising from life assurance contracts were
revalued at a rate corresponding to the revaluation of mortgages and other claims held by the Land Credits
Institute, assurance companies, and savings banks.
The decree of February 14, 1924, was a good concept but it ran into some problems in application. Creditors had
lost virtually all value to inflation and were angry about how their trust was abused, and the government wanted
to renew the rewards for lending, which was the intention of this plan. Creditors induced the German
Government to announce a new plan which became law on July 16, 1925. The chief provisions of the new law
were as follows: (a) The normal rate of revaluation of mortgages was raised to 25% of the original gold value, (b)
the law applied to extinct mortgages, if the creditor had accepted the reimbursement with a reservation, (c) for
mortgages taken up after June 15, 1922, the law had retroactive effect even if the reimbursement had been
accepted without reservation, (d) the payment of sums due on the basis of this law could be demanded after
January 1, 1932: in the meantime debtors paid interest at 1.2% after January 1, 1925, 2.5% after July 1, 1925, 3%
after January 1, 1926, and 5% after January 1, 1928, (e) the debtor could obtain a reduction in the rate of
revaluation to 15% in cases of straitened economic conditions, (f) those who had bought industrial debentures
before July 1, 1920, received (besides 15% of the gold value of the security) a small share in the dividends of the
company, (g) for securities taken up after January 1, 1918, there was used, as a coefficient for the transformation
from paper value to gold value, an average between the dollar exchange rate and the index number of wholesale
prices. Just as debt reductions have the effect of easing credit, weakening the currency and increasing inflation
(or lessening deflation), debt revaluations tighten credit, support currencies and lower inflation.360
Under the Loan Redemption Act that came into force on the same day, July 16, 1925, as the Revaluation Act,
certain holders of public bonds gained a revaluation, as they had not under the Third Emergency Tax Decree.361
Throughout 1924, the supply and demand for foreign exchange were largely dependent on the credit policy of the
Reichsbank. The connection between the abundance of credit and the depreciation of the exchange rate in the
first quarter of 1924, which was followed by the tightening of credit and strengthening of the mark in the
succeeding months, was obvious and confirmed the ideas of the Quantity Theory.

On October 15, 1923, the German government took the step of completely suspending loans for “Passive
Resistance”. These excessively generous subsidies, which were granted by the German government, were the
principal cause of the enormous deficit in 1923, so eliminating them reduced the budget deficit. Also in the
autumn of 1923, the German government tried to free the budget temporarily from the burden of reparations by
putting the burden on to private industry. On November 23, 1923, the “Micum” (Mission Interalliée de Controle
des Usines et des Mines) and the leading heavy industries concluded an agreement about the supply of coal on
reparations account.362 This fiscal tightening also supported the currency and helped to reduce inflation.
Control over the foreign exchange market was gradually relaxed—e.g., the “Foreign Exchange Commissioner”
ceased to function. However, certain restrictions (based on the decrees of October 31 and of November 8, 1924)
remained. They (a) specified the process for making foreign payments (which had to be done through an
authorized bank), (b) prohibited forward contracts in foreign exchange (c) prohibited the buying or selling of
foreign exchange at a higher rate than the official rate in Berlin, and (d) required banks to furnish the authorities
with information on foreign exchange business concluded in their own names or for a third party.
Whenever the Rentenbank gave direct loans, it imposed the so-called “constant value clause” which required the
borrower to repay them in gold marks.
According to a new law that was passed August 30, 1924, and effective on October 11, 1924, a new German
currency called the “reichsmark” was created. Its value was set at 1 reichsmark = 1 trillion paper marks, and 1
reichsmark = 1 rentenmark. The old paper mark was then completely withdrawn from circulation and ceased to
be legal tender on June 5, 1925. The transition to a stable German currency was complete.
The gold content of the reichsmark was the same as that which was fixed for the old mark set on March 14, 1875
(1,392 marks = 500 grams of fine gold). The system established after November 1923 continued, so the old
notes circulated internally but remained unconvertible. Through this process, the German monetary system was
essentially on a dollar exchange standard.363
The Reich budget was quickly balanced to everyone’s amazement. This occurred via: (a) the strict cutting down
of expenses, and (b) the introduction of new taxes and the revaluation of existing taxes and tariffs. The expenses
of civil administration were reduced by dismissing a great number of employees. The laws passed on October 15
and November 23 that were previously mentioned had a big effect. But other moves also helped. In Germany,
after the war, the heaviest item in the Reich expenditure was the service of public loans. Of the 17.5 billion marks
estimated expenditure for the financial year 1919, interest on loans of the Reich represented a good 10 billion.
But the monetary depreciation caused the pre-war debt and debts contracted during and after the war to
disappear almost completely. To deal with this, the consolidated debt of the Reich (58.5 billion gold marks) was
entirely annulled, and the floating debt in paper marks, which amounted to 197 trillion paper marks on November
15, 1923 was paid by the transfer to the Reichsbank of 197 million rentenmarks lent by the Rentenbank with the
Reich not paying any interest on this.364
Once the exchange rate was stabilized, the yield of taxes increased rapidly primarily because of increased tax
revenue arising from the economy’s improvement. Tax revenues rose from 14.5 million gold marks in October
1923 to 63.2 millions in November, 312.3 millions in December 1923, and to 503.5 millions in January 1924.
Thanks to this marked increase in receipts and controls on spending, the budget was balanced in January 1924,

One of the common characteristics of countries that stabilized their currencies and controlled their inflations
after an extended period of rampant inflation has been a lack of working capital and a high rate of interest.366
That set of circumstances existed in Germany through most of 1924.
Until August 23, 1926, the Reichsbank kept the exchange rate of the dollar steady in German marks. In the
financial year 1924-25, there was a considerable surplus of receipts over expenses.
During the years between 1925 and the financial crisis of 1931 the fluctuating amounts of foreign loans were the
main driver in determining the value of the mark in terms of other currencies. For long periods, the persistent
supply of foreign exchange arising from long or short-term loans had the effect of maintaining an exchange rate
favorable to Germany. Also, the Reichsbank was able to replenish its gold reserves rapidly.
Through numerous banks that were created by the Reich itself, funds which had accumulated in the Reich or
State Treasuries were lent to German business generally as short-term loans, though the Reich and States often
granted special long-term loans to industry and agriculture. The government also invested money in the
purchase of firms and industrial shares.
Also, tightening credit to make it profitable to be long the currency and painful to be short it is a classic means of
stabilizing the currency and lowering inflation. This happened in Germany at the time. While interest rates rose
slower than inflation early in the upswing in inflation, interest rates rose faster than inflation at the end. In
December 1923, complete confidence in German money was not yet re-established and the premium for the risk
of depreciation remained high. According to the statements of a well-known banker, the interest rate on
overnight paper mark loans in December 1923 was typically not lower than 3-5% per month. On the other hand,
for rentenmark loans (which had a clause that guaranteed the lender against the risk of the depreciation of the
rentenmark itself), interest was 1-1.5% per month. This interest rate shows that the guarantee was given some
credence (which is why the interest rate was lower than the paper mark rate), but not discounted as being
certain (which is why the rate was still high). During 1924, the highest rates of interest occurred in April and
May. Interest rates rose to very high levels that produced a high premium relative to the expected future
depreciation of the currency.367

This tightening was reflected in the divergence between the official discount rate and the market rate. In normal
times the market rate was lower than the rate fixed by the Reichsbank, but in 1924 the situation was reversed368
because money was so tight. After the stabilization of the mark and the monetary reform of November 1923, the
shortage of capital became really serious causing those who had bet on the mark’s depreciation to be squeezed.
For example, those who borrowed marks to buy inflation hedge assets were squeezed as borrowing costs and the
mark rose at the same time as the prices of inflation hedge assets fell.369
While in late 1923 inflation was practically the only form of taxation and it weighed almost exclusively on
capitalists, workers, and private and Government salaried employees, after stabilization that all changed. Those
penalized by the inflation benefited and high direct taxes became effective.
As the profits from inflation disappeared, the tremendous waste of inflation hedge activities became apparent
and those who engaged in them lost a lot. Numerous entrepreneurs who had bought firms with debt lost
everything when the currency was stabilized.370 Due to the insufficiency of working capital and the fall in
inflation hedging activities, industries reduced their demands for instruments of production to free up working
capital. For example, during the period of inflation, there was the accumulation of stocks of unsold coal and iron,
but after it subsided, these were dumped at losses. “The prosperity of the industries consuming coal, which had
been dependent on the inflation, caused rapid development of all the mines,”371 but with the stabilization now in
place, the mining industry found itself heavily burdened with very small or negative returns, and those that
produced coal of poor quality found that it was no longer saleable. Between the end of 1923 and October 1925,
63 mines in the Ruhr area were closed.372 One report at the time described the situation as follows: “We have
some very extensive factories which are nothing but rubbish. It is not sufficient, if we wish to restore our
business, to close these establishments, in the hope of reopening them later. Even factories not working cost
money…Therefore our slogan must be: Demolition!” It was estimated that three quarters of the existing plant in
shipyards was useless. More than a hundred thousand bank employees were discharged during 1924 and
1925.373
On the other hand, goods for direct consumption were very scarce at the beginning of 1924. While the industries
producing instruments of production and raw materials were in a crisis, broadly speaking, industries that
produced goods for direct consumption, or the raw materials especially used by these industries did well. During
1925, the deleveraging of share prices was especially marked for the mining and iron and steel industries, and for
some branches of the engineering trade such as that of making railway goods. It was felt less by industries that
produced direct consumption goods, such as textiles and beer. Stocks fell, especially in industries that did
relatively well in inflation.374
One of the immediate and most typical consequences of the monetary stabilization was the sudden rise in the
purchasing power of the working class. While rent controls and inflation had made the working class’
expenditures on rent practically disappear by 1923, after the stabilization rents were raised rapidly. As rents
rose, it became economic to build houses to rent out, and for those who had rented to own instead. While during
the period of inflation the building trade was practically limited to the building of mansions for the newly rich who
were profiting from the monetary depreciation, in 1924 there was a revival of the building of houses for the
working and middle classes.375

Labor productivity also increased rapidly after stabilization. For example, it was reported that in June 1926 in the
Ruhr coal area, 389,037 employees produced more coal, and of better quality, than was produced by 581,054 in
1923.376

There was a big increase in wages in the first months of 1924 as wage restrictions were lifted and there was a
reaction against the excessively low wages which had been fixed at the beginning of the monetary stabilization.
During 1924 the big increase in the average income of workers was the combined effect of the rise in wage-rates
and the fall in unemployment. But from 1925 to 1928 the general movement of workers’ incomes was principally
influenced by the rise in wage-rates rather than increased employment. For example, while in June 1925 the
monthly unemployment rate was 4.6% of the members of trade unions and the index of workers incomes was
110.8, in June 1928 the percentage of unemployed was 7.5%377 and the index of workers’ incomes rose to 124.
As domestic money and credit was tight and there was a need for it, the German industrialists drew on their
reserves of foreign exchange, which they had deposited in foreign banks during the depreciation of the mark.
Besides helping to stabilize the mark and contain inflation, it supported business activity.
Both the government and the Director of the Reichsbank agreed that the stabilization of the value of the currency
was a necessity which should have precedence over any other matter.378
As a result of this stable currency policy, German foreign trade in 1924 and 1925 was characterized by an
enormous increase in imports of food and unprocessed goods, while there was no growth in manufactured goods
imports (see below). In 1924 and 1925, exports remained stationary.379

Though I will not continue this chronology beyond 1925, I have included the following charts to convey the
picture of what happened in Germany into the Great Depression in 1932. As the previous chronology of the
Great Depression includes a description of Germany until 1938, those who are interested in how this operatic
drama continued through then can pick up the story there. The charts below show (1) the nominal and real stock
prices, (2) the mark/dollar exchange rate and the price of gold in marks, (3) the inflation rate and changes in M0,
and (4) the growth rate of industrial production from 1923 through 1932.

Productivity and Structural Reform:
Why Countries Succeed & Fail, and What Should Be
Done So Failing Countries Succeed
by Ray Dalio
In this section the drivers of productivity are shown and are used to create an economic health index. That index
shows how 20 major countries are doing as measured by 19 economic health gauges made up of 81 indicators,
and it shows what these gauges portend for real GDP growth in each of these countries over the next 10 years.
As you will see, past predictions based on this process have been highly reliable. For this reason this economic
health index provides a reliable formula for success. By looking at these cause-effect relationships in much the
same way as a doctor looks at your genetics, blood tests and regimes for exercise and diet, we can see each
country’s health prospects and also know what changes can be made so that these countries can become
economically healthier.
We are making this research available in the hope that it will facilitate the very important discussions about
structural reforms that are now going on and will help both the public and policy makers to look past their
ideological differences to see the economy as a machine in much the same way as doctors see bodies and look at
the relationships of cholesterol and heart attacks analytically rather than ideologically.

The Template
This section is presented in three parts:
•

In Part 1, “The Formula For Economic Success,” we show how indicators of countries’ productivity and
indebtedness would have predicted their subsequent 10-year growth rates going back 65 years, and how
these economic health indicators can be used to both predict and shape the long-term economic health
of countries. By knowing the linkages between a) indicators of productivity such as the costs of
educated people, the amount of bureaucracy in the government, the amount of corruption in the system,
how much people value working relative to enjoying life, etc., and b) the subsequent 10-year economic
outcomes, policy makers can decide how to change these determinants to affect long-term outcomes.

•

In Part 2, “Economic Health Indices by Country, and the Prognoses that They Imply” we show each of
the 20 countries’ economic health indices by component and aggregated, and how these lead to the
projected growth over the next 10 years. In this section you can see a synthesis for each country based
on an objective review of each of the indicators and their relative importance. Because our
understanding has been completely systematized, there is no qualitative judgment used in describing
these estimates. In fact, the texts have been computer generated.

•

In Part 3, “The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years”, we will look at how different
countries’ shares of the world economy have changed over the last 500 years and why these changes
have occurred.

Part 1: The Formula for Economic Success
What determines which countries prosper and which countries don’t? What determines different countries’
future growth rates? For our investment purposes we look at relationships between causes and effects that we
hope will be useful to others in answering these questions.
While many people have provided opinions about why countries succeed and fail economically, they have not
shown linkages between causes and effects. As a result, their opinions can be misleading. Often, even commonly
agreed-upon indicators of what is good for an economy have not been properly analyzed and correlated with
subsequent results. For example, everyone knows that having a more educated population is better than having
a less educated population, so naturally we hear that improving education is important to improving
productivity. However, indicators of the cost-effectiveness of education are lacking and correlations of the
factors with subsequent growth don’t exist, at least to my knowledge. That is dangerous. For example, if policy
makers simply educate people without considering the costs and paybacks of that education, they will waste
resources and make their economies less productive even though we will become more educated people. To
make matters worse, the views of those who influence polices typically reflect their ideological inclinations (e.g.,
being politically left or right) which divides people. For this reason, I believe that objective good indicators that
are correlated with subsequent results are needed so that the facts speak for themselves and help people reach
agreement about what should be done. That is what I believe I provide here. The economic health indicators that
I will show would have predicted the subsequent 10-year real growth of the 20 countries shown over the last 65
years within 2% of the realized growth about 80% of the time and within 1% half of the time, with the average
miss around 1%.
While I believe that the body of evidence I will show you is compelling, I certainly don’t claim to have all the
answers or expect people to blindly follow what is presented here without poking at it. On the contrary. I am
putting these cause-effect relationships on the table to help foster the debate to bring about progress. I hope
that people of divergent views will explore and debate how the economic machine works by looking at both the
logic and the evidence presented here, then see what it portends for the future, and then explore what can be
done to make the future better. Having said that, we are confident enough in these estimates to bet on their
accuracy, which we do in our investments.

The Determinants of Economic Health Are Timeless and Universal
As with human bodies, I believe that the economies of different countries have worked in essentially the same
ways for as far back as you can see so that the most important cause-effect relationships are timeless and
universal. In this section I review these cause-effect relationships and look at many countries in different
timeframes to show how they worked. I will lay these out for you to consider. I don’t believe that it’s good
enough to just show the correlations between changes in these factors and their outcomes. I believe that it’s
necessary to be so clear on the fundamental cause-effect relationships that it seems obvious that they must be
so; otherwise you can’t be confident that a relationship is timeless and that you aren’t missing something. I will
first present the concepts and then take you into the indicators to show how they worked in the past and what
they portend for the future.

What are the Keys to Success?
I Will Start With a Top-Down Perspective: As with health, many factors (reflected in many statistics) produce
good and bad outcomes. You can approach them by looking down on the forest or building up from the trees. In
presenting them I wrestled with whether to start at the top and work our way down through all the pieces or start
with all the pieces and work ourselves up to the big picture. I chose to approach this from the top down as that’s
the perspective that I’m more comfortable with. I prefer to simplify and then flesh out the picture. Receiving

information presented this way will require you to be patient with the sweeping generalizations I make until I get
down to the particulars that make them up, which will show both the norms and the exceptions.
Productivity Influences on Growth Are Intertwined With Debt Influences: While my objective is to look at
productivity in this section, in doing so I wanted to tie that into looking at the drivers of growth over the next 10
years, which is affected by debt as well as the drivers of productivity. In other words, productivity influences on
growth and debt influences on growth are unavoidably entangled. As explained in “How the Economic Machine
Works,” while productivity growth is ultimately what matters for long-term prosperity, and the effects of debt
cycles cancel out over time, the swings around that productivity long-term trend arising from debt cycles cancel
out over such long amounts of time (upwards of 100 years because of long-term debt cycles) that it is impossible
to look at growth periods without debt cycles playing a role in driving the outcomes. Of course, when one
lengthens the observed timeframe, the shorter-term volatility that is due to debt swings diminishes in
importance. We chose to look at rolling 10-year periods of 20 countries which gave us a sample size of 159
observations (where we measure every 5 years).
The Big Picture: Stepping away from the wiggles of any given day, and looking from the top down, one can see
that the big shifts in economic growth are about two-thirds driven by productivity and one-third driven by
indebtedness. “Luck” (e.g., having a lot of resources when the resources are valuable) and “conflict” (especially
wars) are also drivers.

Productivity
A country’s production (GDP) will equal its number of workers times the output per worker (productivity). One
can increase one’s productivity either by working harder or by working smarter. Productivity is driven by how
cost-effectively one can produce, so relative productivity—i.e., competitiveness—will have a big effect on relative
growth. In a global economy those producers who are more competitive will both 1) sell more in their own
country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they can produce more costeffectively. Likewise, investors will follow these opportunities.
Competitiveness (i.e., relative productivity levels) is driven by what you get relative to what you pay in one
country versus another. Countries are just the aggregates of the people and the companies that make them up.
As you know with the individuals you hire and from the products you buy, those that offer the most value for
money are the most competitive and do better than those that don't.
Specific Indicators: Since people are the largest cost of production, it follows that those countries that offer the
best “value” (i.e., the most productive workers per dollar of cost) will, all else being equal, experience the most
demand for their people. That is why the per-hour-worked cost differences of educated people (i.e., their income
after adjusting for hours worked each year) is one of the best indicators of productivity. Other obvious and
important factors that influence productivity include cost of uneducated people, levels of bureaucracy, attitudes
about work, raw material costs, lending and capital market efficiencies—i.e., everything that affects the value of
what is produced relative to the cost of making it. In other words, there is a world market for productive
resources that increases the demand, and hence the growth rates, for the countries that are most competitive
because of “the cost of production arbitrage.” That cost of production arbitrage has been a big driver of
growth—in fact overwhelmingly the largest. To reiterate, the magnitude of this competitiveness arbitrage is
driven more by the cost of the workers relative to how hard they work, their education, and investment levels,
than by anything else. These variables characterize the value of hiring a worker in a given country and doing
business there (i.e., what you pay for what you get).
Of course, barriers to the flow of trade and capital (like China’s closed door policies until the early 1980s,
geographic isolation, etc.) can stand in the way of people, companies and countries being allowed to compete.
As these barriers break down (e.g., transportation becomes cheaper and quicker, telecommunications reduce

174

impediments to intellectual competition, etc.) or increase (e.g., trade barriers are put up), the ability to arbitrage
the costs of production, and in turn the relative growth rates, is affected.
While countries that operate efficiently will grow at faster paces than countries that operate inefficiently, the
countries that will grow the fastest are those that have big inefficiencies that are disposed of. As an example,
in the 1970s and 1980s, China had a well-educated, intelligent labor force that could work for cheap, but faced a
closed door policy. Opening the door unleashed China’s great potential. Looking forward, while the United States
is relatively efficient, it would not grow as fast as a Russia (i.e., which has competitively priced educated people
with low debt) if Russia could significantly reduce its barriers to productivity (e.g., corruption, lack of
development of its debt/capital markets, lack of investment, lack of innovation, bad work attitudes, lack of
adequate private property laws, etc.). That is why I am most optimistic about inefficient countries that are
undertaking the sort of reforms that are described in this section.
Culture is one of the biggest drivers of productivity. It’s intuitive that what a country’s people value and how
they operate together matters for a country’s competitive position. Culture influences the decisions people make
about factors such as savings rates or how many hours they work each week. Culture can also help explain why
a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform, or vice versa. For
example, in Russia, which has a lot of untapped potential, the culture that affects lifestyles (e.g., alcoholism, the
low drive to succeed, etc.) causes it to substantially under-live its potential, while in Singapore, where high
income levels make their labor relatively uncompetitive, their lifestyles and values (e.g., around working, saving
and investing) allow them to realize a higher percentage of their potential. While lots of elements of culture can
matter, the ones that I find matter most are: 1) the extent to which individuals enjoy the rewards and suffer the
penalties of their productivity (i.e., the degrees of their self-sufficiency), 2) how much the people value savoring
life versus achieving, 3) the extent to which innovation and commercialism are valued, 4) the degree of
bureaucracy, 5) the extent of corruption and 6) the extent to which there is rule of law. Basically, countries that
have people who earn their keep, strive to achieve and innovate, and facilitate an efficient market-based
economy will grow faster than countries that prioritize savoring life, undermine market forces through highly
redistributive systems, and have inefficient institutions. To be clear, I am not making any value judgments. It
would be illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are making a mistake relative to people
who love working. It is however not illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are likely to
be less productive than those who love working.

Indebtedness
At the risk of repeating myself too many times, I will review the way I look at debt cycles because I carry that
perspective into my calculations in explaining 10-year growth rates.
As explained, short-term volatility is more due to debt cycles than productivity, but this volatility cancels out over
time because credit allows people to consume more than they produce when they acquire it, and it forces people
to consume less than they produce when they pay it back. Undulations around long-term productivity are driven
by debt cycles. Remember, in an economy without credit, the only way to increase your spending is to produce
more, but in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. That creates cycles.
When debt levels are low relative to income levels and are rising, the upward cycle is self-reinforcing on the
upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise borrowers’ capacity
to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can’t rise faster than money and
income forever, there are limits to debt growth.
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited
amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can’t live on it forever. In the case of debt, you can
take it out before you put it in (i.e., if you don’t have any debt, you can take it out), but you are expected to return
what you took out. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the
appearance of being prosperous. At such times, you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as

being creditworthy and not pay enough attention to what paying back will look like. When debts can no longer
be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse.
You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being a
support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the
attractiveness of taking on new debt. For these reasons I expect countries that have a) low amounts of debt
relative to incomes, b) debt growth rates that are low in relation to income growth rates and c) easier
monetary policies to grow faster over the next ten years than countries with d) high amounts of debt relative
to incomes, e) debt growth rates that are high in relation to income growth rates and f) tighter monetary
policies. That is true with one exception, which is when adequate financial intermediaries don’t exist.
Institutions and capital markets that facilitate these transactions have to be in place for the system to work. For
that reason, when forecasting long-term future growth rates we have taken into consideration the levels of
development of countries’ financial intermediaries.
Luck and Wars: As mentioned, they can play a role. For example, the US having shale gas was lucky. Potential
conflicts should always be watched. While to some extent these can be anticipated, they are not part of our
formula and they don’t typically matter much—i.e., they are exceptional.

The Interaction of These Forces is Driven By Human Nature
While productivity and indebtedness can be thought of as separate concepts, they are ultimately a function of
the choices people make and their psychology. I briefly touched on culture as an influence on these choices and
their outcomes. Also, I observe important shifts in attitudes from one generation to the next which are due to
their different experiences. In Part 3, “The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years,” I show
how psychology tends to shift as countries move through their economic life cycles. It is worth touching on this
influence here before I delve into an examination of what all the economic health indicators are pointing to for
the 20 major economies.
In addition to productivity and the debt cycles I spoke about, there tends to be a psychologically motivated cycle
that occurs as a function of one’s past level of prosperity and whether one experienced improving or worsening
economic conditions. When a country is poor and focused on survival, its people who have subsistence lifestyles
don’t waste money because they value it a lot and they don’t have any debt to speak of because savings are short
and nobody wants to lend to them. Even though the country’s labor is low-cost, it is not competitive, and the lack
of investment stymies future productivity gains. Some emerge from this stage and others don’t, with culture and
location being two of the biggest determinants. For those that do—either because a country removes a big
barrier like being closed to the world (as China did in 1980) or simply because a more gradual evolution makes
their labor attractive—a virtuous cycle can kick in. At this stage, the investments are not just inexpensive; the
stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of room to adopt existing
technologies that can radically improve the country’s potential. Leveraging up (increasing one’s indebtedness)
can feed back into higher productivity and competitiveness gains, which produce high returns that attract more
investment at a time when the capacity to leverage is high. The key is that this money and credit must be used to
produce investments that yield enough returns to pay for the debt service and finance further growth (so that
incomes rise as fast as or faster than debts). Yet as countries grow wealthier, more and more of the credit tends
to fuel consumption rather than investment. A process that was once virtuous can become self-destructive. The
decreased investment in quality projects means productivity growth slows, even as the borrowing and spending
makes incomes grow and labor more expensive. People feel rich and begin taking more leisure—after all, asset
prices are high—even though their balance sheets are starting to deteriorate. At this point, debt burdens start to
compound and incomes grow faster than productivity growth. In other words, the country tends to become
over-indebted and uncompetitive. The country is becoming poor even though it is still behaving as though it is
rich. Eventually the excess tends to lead to bubbles bursting, a period of slow decline and deleveraging. Suffice it
to say that when looking at a country’s potential to grow, it is critical to look at the country’s productivity and
indebtedness holistically, as part of its stage of development.

A Formula for Future Growth
As explained, my research team and I built the formula for future growth from the top down. We started with my
concepts of how productivity and indebtedness affect growth, then fleshed these forces out with specific
indicators, and then saw how the formula created this way worked. I followed this approach because I believe
that one should be able to describe the cause-effect relationships and the logic behind them without looking at
the data and that only after doing that should one look at the data to see how well the descriptions square with
what happened because otherwise one would be inclined to be blinded by data and not force oneself to
objectively test one’s understanding of the cause-effect relationships.
As mentioned, from what I can tell, about two-thirds of a country’s 10-year growth rates will be due to
productivity and about one-third will be due to indebtedness. The visual below conveys these two forces. Our
productivity indicators aim to measure how steep the productivity growth line will be over time, and our
indebtedness measures aim to measure how debt cycles will influence growth over the medium term.

Below is a list of what I have come to learn about these things along with the names of the indices my research
team and I created to reflect them. Based on the reasons outlined there, we created 1) a simple logic-weighted
index of productivity and 2) a simple logic-weighted index of indebtedness. We used the same set of factors
weighed the same way for each gauge across all the countries and across all timeframes. That way there was no
fitting the data and our measures for productivity and indebtedness are timeless and universal. We put twothirds of the weight on productivity and a third on indebtedness.380 After creating these indices, we observed
how each predicted the subsequent 10 years’ growth rates for each country (which we measure every 5 years).
In other words, we observed rather than fit the data. The table below shows the concepts, their weights, and
their correlations with the next 10 years’ per capita growth rates for our universe of 20 countries. Together these
indicators were 84% correlated with the countries’ subsequent growth rates. Below we show how well these
measures related to future growth across countries and time.381

380

As mentioned, our gauges of productivity and indebtedness are constructed using simple logic-based weights. Within productivity, we put
two-thirds weight on what you pay versus what you get and one-third on culture. Within each of these gauges we put equal weight on the
different sub-pieces. Within our indebtedness gauge, we put half the weight on debt cycle dynamics and half on monetary policy.
381
My approach to research is to first think through what makes sense to me and to look at the data to stress test my thinking. This is a very
different approach compared to optimization methods (or data mining) which typically go to the data first, and fish for relationships and
conclusions. Because I was asked how much better the results would be if we let the computer fit the equations, we ran the data fitting
exercise and observed that if we do that, the correlations with future growth don't change much (they range from 80% to 85% correlated
with future growth results depending on the process used).

These measures of productivity and indebtedness can be used to predict each country’s absolute and relative
growth rates over the next ten years, or longer periods. They also can be used by policy makers to indicate what
levers they can move to influence future growth. To reiterate, my goal is to get the big picture right—i.e., to
reliably be approximately right by focusing on the most important drivers rather than to try to be precise by
focusing on the details.
Before looking at the picture we will show you how our aggregate indicator would have predicted growth versus
what actually occurred. While staring at the observations helps us ground ourselves in reality and test our logic,
we know there is no precision in the specific numbers and what matters most to us is whether our logic is strong.
Our examination covers 159 separate observations across 20 different countries over the last 65 years, which
provides a wide range of different environments to test our indicator. Along with the correlation of our
predictions and what growth actually materialized (shown below), another test is how reliably we predicted
something reasonably close to what happened. In our set, our aggregate predictions for a country’s average
growth over the next decade were within 1% of the actual about half of the time, and within 2% around 80% of
the time.

Because these are timeless and universal drivers, we expect them to be just as important in developed countries
as they are in emerging ones. The type of investment or education that matters may shift, but ultimately whether
a country sees productivity growth is still going to be largely a function of the basic building blocks of
productivity-----whether its workers offer value, whether it is investing in its culture and creating a culture of
success-----as well as how its indebtedness is evolving. Across the countries we have examined, our aggregate
indicator is about as correlated with future growth for developed and emerging countries (69% correlated with
the growth in income per worker in developed countries and 81% correlated in emerging countries). Of course,
which countries are ‘‘developed’’ or ‘‘emerging’’ changes over very long periods as discussed in ‘‘The Rises and
Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years.’’ So in the tests shown below, we adjust for that, for example
excluding Japan in the 1960s when it was much more like an emerging country.

To reiterate, I believe getting to this fundamental level is critical to understanding and predicting the growth of
countries. Naïve measures of a country’s future growth, for example just income on its own or a country’s trailing
growth, won’t get you much because they won’t help you get at the drivers. They also tend to be much worse
predictors than the formula I have described here (about 25% as good by traditional statistical measures).
Looking at the economy as a machine and granularly measuring the cause-effect relationships makes all the
difference.

Projections
I will start with our projections and then explain how they were derived.
As discussed, by looking at the elements that drive productivity and indebtedness you can arrive at a view of how
fast a country will grow its output per worker. Since economic growth is mechanically just a function of growth in
its a) output per worker and b) number of workers, it’s then a simple step for us to estimate economic growth. In
the following section we quickly scan what our projections show. We will then go into depth on the reasons
behind them.
The chart below shows our estimate in aggregate for real GDP growth in these major countries. We provide two
estimates: one that is based on the exact same formula for all countries and one that is that estimate corrected
for the average past error. This additional step notes whether we were systematically over-optimistic or
pessimistic in our predictions for a given country, and adjusted for that, to account for the fact that we may be
missing a factor specific to that country.382 We simply found how much the universal formula was off in the past
on average (e.g., 1%) and assumed that it would be off by that amount over the next ten years. That adjustment
is meant to account for unexplained factors. These two estimates typically don’t yield meaningful differences
and typically don’t affect the order of the countries’ rankings. We don’t know which one is better so we look at
both. Overall, we expect India to grow fastest, followed by China, Singapore and Mexico. Our expectation is for
the US and the UK to be among the fastest-growing developed nations and for Japan and southern European
countries to be the slowest growing in the world.

382
Note: In sectioning our misses, we realized that sometimes for a given country we were systematically over-optimistic about its growth
or pessimistic. Overall these biases are pretty small but they also raise the question of whether we are missing a specific factor that is
particularly important for that country (we know we can’t capture everything). The correlation shown above of 84% includes our adjustment
for these country-specific misses (for lack of a better term our ‘error adjustment’). It’s not a big deal—if we don’t make this adjustment the
correlation is 77% (i.e., a 77% correlation between our prediction for a country’s growth in income per worker over the next decade and the
growth in income per worker that materialized, across our sample of 20 countries and 159 datapoints). This allows us to show a type of
range in our estimates for countries, which highlights what we have gotten wrong in the past and its magnitude.

Because GDP is just output per worker times the number of workers, that estimate includes two major pieces:
demographic trends (or more specifically the expected change in workers), and an estimate of future growth per
worker. We show the chart of the expected change in workers first, below. On this measure, you can see that
Europe, Russia and Japan’s challenges are compounded by an aging and shrinking workforce, while countries like
Mexico and India will enjoy a growth in workers as a support to their potential growth.

Our future growth per worker estimate includes two major components: a productivity estimate, and an
indebtedness estimate. We show both of these estimates below. They highlight the general attractiveness of the
labor arbitrage between most emerging countries relative to the developed world. There is also much more
room for these countries to leverage up whereas much of the developed world has reached its long-term debt
top and is deleveraging, which means there is much more limited room for spending and income growth to come
from credit expansion.

Productivity and Competiveness Measures
Before getting more into our specific measures of productivity/competitiveness I want to start by reviewing our
concepts pertaining to it.
A country’s competitiveness is driven by the value of all that it offers relative to the value of what others offer
—most importantly the value of its people relative to their cost. In a global economy, countries that are more
productive will not only produce better value products, but they will also attract investment and new businesses,
and they will compel the means of production to move. We expect the producers who are more competitive to
both 1) sell more in their own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they
can produce more cost-effectively.
As explained, the most important way countries differentiate themselves is through their labor: whether it is
more attractive for a company to hire their workers than to hire workers in a different country. This is not just a
function of whether the workers are more productive today. It’s a function of the attributes that make them more
attractive to hire and invest in over the long term. Since ultimately the only way one can become more
productive is through working harder or working smarter, it makes intuitive sense to us that education and work
ethic are the most important attributes that matter. Those countries that offer these most cost-competitively
tend to do the best. A country may also be more attractive because it’s a cheap place to build a factory or
because the returns of building new capital and technologies are higher. Additionally, countries that save and
invest more tend to grow faster by creating new innovations, capital equipment and infrastructure that help
improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited investment rates.
These are the most important ingredients for the productivity growth of a country. But that’s not all there is to it.
Partly, culture drives the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work
each week. But culture can also help explain why a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth
but consistently underperform.
Culture matters a lot. Ultimately how a country develops is a function of human behavior and the decisions its
people make. Many of those decisions are captured in the attributes that go into a country’s relative productivity
(like how much people save or how hard they work). But you can learn a lot about the psychology of the different
players in the economy and their motivations by staring at different cultural elements. Over very long stretches
of time a country’s cultural evolution is at the core of its long-term cycles (from being poor and believing it’s poor
to becoming rich). Over any decade, the way we think about culture is that it can help explain why a country can
appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform or outperform. For us it makes
intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve are more likely to
succeed by creating a meritocratic environment where incentives are based largely on market forces. Countries
can also outperform if they are more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and more
commercially minded in harvesting them. On the other hand, countries can underperform if they are corrupt or
bureaucratic, or if the rule of law is unsound. To be clear, we are not assessing whether one culture is good or
bad; our focus is on the cultural elements that are most important for economic prosperity.

Our Productivity Gauge
For these reasons, when we look at gauging the productivity of a country we create a measure of 1) the relative
value it offers and 2) its culture. We weigh the relative value of a country the most since it is the most important
determinant.
Our productivity gauge is just based on the logic we have described. It is mostly a function of the relative value
of a country’s workers (the labor arbitrage aspect): how educated they are relative to their cost and how hard the
people work relative to their cost. These measures give us a sense of whether a country’s workers have the
ingredients to grow their productivity by working harder or smarter. To triangulate the cost of an educated
worker we look at two measures, one that adjusts for the quality of education and one that looks at their
observed productivity today. Moving beyond a country’s human capital, we also look at investment relative to
the cost, which gives us a lens into whether a country is investing to grow its productivity in the future and
whether the returns are likely to be attractive (i.e., another perspective on the “cost of production arbitrage”).
To measure culture, we create a gauge for each of the concepts we have outlined: 1) whether a country values
self-sufficiency, 2) whether it values savoring the fruits of life or achieving, 3) whether it is innovative and
commercially oriented, 4) its degree of bureaucracy, 5) corruption and 6) rule of law. Self-sufficiency
encourages productivity by tying the ability to spend to the need to produce. The concept of savoring life versus
achieving captures how much the people in a country are focused on enjoying the things they have versus trying
to increase their success and achieve, earn, and create more. Innovation and commercialism capture whether a
society is oriented towards seeking profit or generating new insights. The last three get at the basic questions of
how difficult it is to get business done in a country—i.e., whether a given country is one where businesses could
get off the ground and operate smoothly, where business can be conducted fairly (without corruption) and
whether investors and businesses can be confident that contracts and laws will be well enforced.
Together our indicators of productivity were 64% related to countries’ subsequent growth rates. To repeat,
these estimates were made by applying the exact same factors to all countries in all time periods to determine
their subsequent growth.

The chart below gives a picture of how we would rate countries today on productivity based on the same logic
described above. Our ratings are represented in terms of what a given country’s productivity would imply for
that country’s future growth in income per worker over the next 10 years.
According to our measures, India is best placed to see productivity growth at this point—driven by a very cheap
and achievement-oriented labor force, even accounting for poor education, chronic corruption and a generally
ineffective system. Together these factors imply India has the ingredients to grow income per worker around 9%
annually over the next decade. It also has sizable potential to boost its growth rate if it can reduce its
inefficiencies through reforms. China is also highly competitive by our measures, with a growth rate implied by
its competitiveness/productivity of about 6% or so. Its workforce is inexpensive and fairly well educated relative
to its cost, works hard and provides huge savings for investments. Moreover, as a country that is becoming rich
and starting to realize it, China has a huge amount of potential to realize by adopting existing technologies,
building out its infrastructure in the underdeveloped parts of the country, and investing in businesses to serve a
massive population that is quickly accumulating spending power. Nearly all developed world countries are
measured to be relatively uncompetitive, with Italy, France, Spain and Greece uniquely uncompetitive for reasons
that will be apparent in the indicators that follow. Most importantly, these countries’ labor is expensive, they
don’t work that hard, and they invest less than most other countries. This is compounded by a social system that
prioritizes savoring life over achieving and insulates workers from market forces with rigid labor markets and
substantial government safety nets, low levels of innovation and high levels of bureaucracy. It should be noted
that we are starting to see some structural reforms to improve productivity and competitiveness, especially in
Spain, and that such reforms have the potential of considerably boosting growth because the barriers that
reforms would bring down are such drags on growth. Japan is also somewhat uncompetitive but more because
its labor is expensive and investment levels stagnant, as opposed to cultural reasons (the work ethic in Japan and
level of innovation, for example, remain quite supportive). In such cases, declines in the exchange rate can help.
Also, Prime Minister Abe’s “three arrow” policies can help a lot if pursued forcefully—more forcefully than
currently pursued. The US is the most competitive of the major developed countries we measure. Labor is more
competitively priced compared to other developed countries (though expensive compared to many emerging
countries), and the culture is supportive, including elements like relative hard work, a drive to achieve and
orientation to innovate.

The following two charts give you a summary of where countries stand on our assessment of value (i.e. what you
pay for what you get) in each country and whether its culture are a support to or drag on income growth.
Overall, the strong value proposition of Asia’s workers—especially how hard they work and their level of
investment relative to their expense—is supported by cultural attitudes around achievement. In contrast,
Europe, once on the frontier of productivity, now invests little and takes more leisure than any other region. And
after years of incomes rising faster than underlying productivity, its workers are some of the most expensive in
the world and the vibrancy of its labor market is undermined by a system of protections. Japan and Singapore
are in the middle of the pack when you look at their high cost of labor and low levels of investment, but we expect
them to be helped by cultural factors (e.g., their orientation toward innovation and commercialism and rule of
law). In contrast, cultural factors—like corruption, a desire for leisure over achievement—act as a drag for
otherwise competitive workforces in Russia and Argentina. We will examine each of the components of these
gauges next.383

The right chart above shows the adjustment (or “bump”) to the productivity estimate we make based on a country’s culture (e.g., based
on our assessment of what you pay for what you get for Singapore’s labor, we would project growth in income per worker of about 2.3%, but
we add another 1.3% based on our assessment that Singapore’s culture is very supportive to growth).

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
As previously discussed, a country’s productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value
it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as “what you
pay versus what you get”; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of
investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher
investment rates grow faster than those that don’t.
To construct this gauge we first looked at the average cost of an educated worker, adjusted for the average hours
worked (including the average workweek, vacation time, and holidays) and adjusted for the quality of education
(based on international tests). We also created a gauge of the productivity-adjusted cost of labor (a spot picture
of how much workers offer relative to what you pay). And we created a gauge of working hard, where we look at
the portion of the population working, and then how many hours each of those workers puts in (again adjusting
for things like vacation). In addition, this gauge considers demographic shifts that change how much that
society is of working age relative to those who are very young or old and dependent. We weighted these
equally. This gives us perspective on the cost and value of employees. We also added in a gauge of savings and
investment that was also weighted equally. As shown in the correlations, all of these measures were individually
highly effective predictors of future growth, as was the aggregate of them. On its own this gauge is 63%
correlated to future growth. Most interesting are the individual country rankings by measure, which are shown in
the charts that follow. We suggest picking a few countries that you are most interested in and seeing where they
stand in these rankings. As we progress through the charts in this section, clear pictures will emerge.

India and China rank at the top of our measure of whether a country is cheap or expensive. India’s work ethic is
very strong, and they’re investing a lot in their economy. And while their education scores in absolute terms are
not very strong, their income levels are low enough to more than compensate. Before adjusting for cost, China
scores better than India along most measures of what a country offers, but Chinese incomes have grown
considerably over the last two decades and India’s workforce is cheaper. The US scores toward the top of the
developed countries thanks to a well-educated workforce that is fairly cheap compared to other developed
countries. Spain rates better in the cut below, which doesn’t weigh cultural elements like Spanish attitudes
toward savoring life versus achieving and self-sufficiency. With labor that is expensive compared to workers of
similar education levels elsewhere, Germany and France are at the bottom of the list.

A Simple Measure of Cost: Per Capita Income
To make any assessment of value we want to look at the attributes of a country relative to their costs. Absent
other indications of productivity or indications of what you get for workers, we’d expect relative income levels
alone to give you some indication of a country’s relative future growth, albeit a naïve one. Through time,
countries with cheap workers and low skills can leverage existing technology to increase their productive ability.
Similarly, the richest countries generally do not continue to outperform the rest of the world, as their competitive
advantages are eaten away by technology transfers to less competitive economies, and the normal behavior of
most economies is to increasingly savor the fruits of success by working and investing less.
Our measure of cost simply compares the nominal GDP per capita of a given country relative to the developed
world average in log terms, which we believe is more reflective of the impact of differences in income levels.
That’s based on our intuition that, from a competitiveness perspective, a $2,000 difference is more meaningful
between one country that makes $500 and one that makes $2,500 than between countries that make $40,000
and $42,000 respectively. Again, this measure of cost is one side of the picture. We combine it with our
assessment of various indications of what a country offers to understand its productivity and competitiveness
(what it offers relative to its cost).
Today, India is by far the lowest-cost country in our sample. Indian per capita GDP is about $1500, which is
much lower than that of many of the major developing world countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, or
Korea. Even with its significant increase in cost in recent years, China’s cost is still one of the lowest in the world.
Its per capita income sits at just $7,000, roughly 70% that of Mexico. However, the differences in cost by area
are significant so that growth in China will largely depend on how development will occur in areas, and among
people, that are inexpensive. While developed world countries in general have relatively high incomes, it’s worth
noting some differentiation between those countries—for example, GDP per capita in the poorest European
countries like Spain and Greece is only about two-thirds as high as the per capita incomes of the richest
developed countries, like the US and Japan. You’ll see below that based on how we look at cost, we don’t make
much of the difference in cost between the developed countries—all are pretty expensive—but we believe there
is a big difference between the cheapest emerging countries, like India and China, and the rest (including other
countries like Argentina and Brazil).

Education
Cost of a Quality Adjusted Educated Worker
Our single best measure of productivity is the relative cost of a country’s educated workforce adjusted for the
quality of that education. To construct our measure we look at the relative cost of different cohorts of educated
workers (college, high school, those without education), allowing us to get closer to the individuals where the
competition occurs. We can then look at the average cost of those workers per hour worked (adjusting for
differences like vacation). Further, we take into account the quality of education in one country versus another
(e.g., if a high school graduate in the US costs the same as one in France, we also want to ask whether the quality
of high school education is the same in both countries). For this adjustment, we use an internationally accepted
measure of education quality.384 That allows us to compare for a given cohort the relative quality of workers’
education compared to the relative cost. To come up with an aggregate measure for a country we weight
proportionally how much of its population is in each group because if a country’s workforce is highly educated,
then most of the labor competition happens with other countries at those levels (e.g., between the drug
researcher in the US and their peers in Germany). Of course we recognize there is some labor arbitrage across
cohorts but this approach lets us capture the dynamic reasonably well.
While there is, if anything, a negative relationship between a country’s level of education and its level of future
growth (because more expensive countries tend to have more educated people who are more expensive), there
is a high correlation between the relative cheapness of a country’s educated people and that country’s
subsequent growth rate. To convey how important it is to consider whether these educated people are expensive
or cheap, consider that while there is a -17% correlation between the average level of a country’s education and
its future growth rate, there is a +66% correlation between cost-adjusted educated level and its future growth
rate.

384

Our measure of education quality is based on the education quality measures of the OECD’s Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA). PISA’s assessments are designed to test the ability to apply knowledge rather than mastery of a specific curriculum. Our
aggregate measure takes into account PISA’s measures of education quality across mathematics, science and reading. While we would not
put too much weight on the specific placement/ranking of a country, where countries place across the range is indicative. Over 65 countries
participated in the most recent PISA section in 2012. The PISA surveys are designed in coordination with participating countries and
reviewed to minimize cultural bias. In some cases, as in China, recent assessments have only been conducted in a few cities, which we make
an adjustment for.

We show our aggregate measure below on the right, next to our measure of education quality385 on its own for
perspective. Overall, India looks to have the most attractively priced educated population, followed by China,
with Russia and Mexico not far behind. Looking across education levels, workers in India with similar levels of
education cost a fraction as much as their peers in the US (around 1/20th). When we adjust for the quality of
education in India being about 50% worse on average, the cost of a quality-adjusted worker in India is still about
1/10th that of a worker in the US. This isn’t all that different from how China’s workers looked 20 years ago.
Remarkably, even as wages in China have risen substantially, so too have education levels and the quality of
education—today the quality-adjusted cost of a worker in China is still highly attractive. Within the developed
world, the US looks to have the most attractive educated workers, despite the quality of a US high school
education now being worse than in other developed countries. In contrast, Europe’s educated labor appears to
be the most expensive in the world by this measure. Despite quality being relatively good, the cost of workers
there, particularly below college level, is high.

While we would not put too much weight in the specific placement/ranking of a country for educational quality, where countries place
across the range is indicative.

Below we take a more granular look at our measure for each cohort of education level, which we use to build up
to the aggregate picture. This approach gives us a much richer picture. For example, in the US college-educated
workers adjusted for quality are more expensive than college-educated workers in Spain. But at the high school
level and below, workers in the US are much cheaper than those in Spain. And since that’s where the
competition occurs between most workers for these countries, overall the US comes out more attractive. We
show below some other points we find interesting.
Both India’s and
China’s workers cost
a fraction relative to
the US, and India’s
workers are 2/3 the
cost of China’s when
adjusting for quality.
India’s workers are
least costly at higher
levels of education
(especially tertiary).

Cost of labor in Emerging World is less than half

levels.

Less educated
workers in the
US appear
much lower
cost than in the
rest of the
developed
world.
European labor
looks especially
expensive at
these levels.

Cost of a Productivity Adjusted Educated Worker
To triangulate our picture of the cost of an educated worker, we also look at the cost adjusting for observed
differences in productivity (output per hour worked) rather than education quality. With this measure, we take
the same approach of looking at the cost of the different cohorts. By adjusting for differences in observed
productivity today we can get a better sense of the effective cost. Imagine you hire two workers of the same
cost: one has a better education, but the other is more productive from day one on the job. This measure helps
us weigh that second perspective, though it is somewhat less correlated with future incomes than our qualityadjusted measure, about 49%. Our measures are below. The overall picture isn’t all that different. India looks
even stronger on this measure since their observed productivity is quite strong. In contrast, Japan falls lower
down.

Working Hard
Just like hard-working individuals, hard-working countries will generally be more productive and find ways to
improve faster than those who are less hard working. We believe a country’s work ethic impacts both the level of
its relative advantage today and the pace at which it learns and improves over time. Working hard doesn’t just
mean working a lot of hours; it means having a certain ethic, a determination to achieve quality outcomes and to
improve. Demographics can also impact the work ethic of a society—when a society ages and the number of
dependents rises relative to those in the workforce, it can impact the overall work ethic of the society. Similarly,
when there is a boom of young professionals, it can improve the vibrancy, initiative and determination of the
society. We expect a country with a hard-working society that is low-cost to be more competitive and grow
faster than a country with a population that prefers leisure and is expensive.
To construct a simple measure of working hard, we look at two pieces, 1) average weekly hours of actual work by
men in the labor force, adjusting for things like vacation time and holidays, and 2) shifts in the amount of the
population as a whole that is working. While the number of hours worked is just one measure of the effort a
country puts in, and doesn’t account for the determination and effort put in during those hours, it gives us a
decent starting point; we return to some other measures that triangulate our picture when we look at culture.
Just using this gauge on its own yields a 53% correlation with future growth, but when combined with cost
indications, it is 66% correlated with subsequent 10-year growth.
We look at our aggregate measure below first, followed by components. Emerging Asian workers are generally
the hardest workers in the world, including China, India and Thailand. Mexico also stands out as particularly
hard-working. Among the richer countries, Singapore is by far the hardest working (competitive with much
poorer countries), and Japanese workers are some of the most hard-working of developed countries, followed by
the English-speaking developed countries. Continental European workers are generally the least hard-working in
the world. Adjusting for cost largely keeps these divergences in place, though India’s relative cheapness makes it
look more attractive.

Working Hard Subcomponent: Average Hours Worked
When looking at whether a country works hard, we look at the portion of the population working, and then how
many hours each of those workers puts in. Regrettably, we must look at this measure for just men in the labor
force because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort the numbers, and
we must adjust for things like labor force participation, vacation time and holidays where data is limited. Again,
these measures are designed to be simple—we triangulate them when we look at work ethic as part of the
concepts of self-sufficiency and achievement orientation in our culture indicator.
When we look at hours worked on its own, Thailand, India and China are at the top, with Mexico not far behind
and Singapore by far the hardest working of the wealthier countries. The Europeans work the least. Japanese
workers, who used to be among the very hardest working in the world, still rank well on this metric but are now
towards the middle. When we look at this measure of working hard adjusted for cost, we see some countries
really stand out on either end—the dollar cost of effort, if you will, is particularly attractive in India, and especially
bad in Europe.

Working Hard Subcomponent: Demographics
There is a natural cycle to how hard a person works and what they contribute, and typically one’s working years
are the most hard-working and productive ones. So it follows that societies go through long ebbs and flows in
terms of how hard they work in aggregate, based on how much of that society is of working age versus very
young or old and dependent.
Demographic pressures are measured by the projected change in the dependency ratio over the next 10 years.
This represents the projected rise or decline in the proportion of a country’s population that is young or old
relative to those of working age. Our expectation is that a rise in the proportion of dependents (e.g., elderly
individuals) would be a negative for the overall work effort in society and thereby for growth, all else equal.
In general, most major developed countries in the world today are likely to see a drag on their future growth in
income per worker from these demographic shifts, due to increasingly aging populations. This impact is
particularly acute for Japan but significant in the US, Europe, and UK. The picture is more mixed in the emerging
world. Demographic pressures are a support in India but a drag in China, Russia and Korea, due to their aging
populations. Adjusting for cost levels exacerbates the negative picture for the developed world. In the emerging
world India is the one country that stands out as having a positive pressure after adjusting for cost; the pressure
looks more muted in most of the rest, including China.

Investing
Countries that save and invest in their future tend to grow faster by creating capital equipment and infrastructure
that helps improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited investment
rates. Further, high rates of savings provide the capital needed to invest in the most innovative companies. Of
course, there are always risks that this investment is unproductive. Typically the investments that yield the most
productivity gains occur in emerging countries that are just becoming rich. At this stage, the investments are not
just inexpensive; the stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of
room to adopt existing technologies that can radically improve the country’s potential.
Investing is measured by looking at 1) the rate of total non-residential fixed investment in a given economy and
2) the household savings rate. Looking at investing on its own has historically had a 20% correlation with future
growth, but when combined with cost it has had a 59% correlation with future growth.
The rate of Chinese investment and savings is the highest in the world, though increasingly inefficient. The
development of modern infrastructure and increasing business investment has been an important contributor to
the productivity growth of the Chinese workforce over the last few decades—though an increasing share of this
investment is going to less productive uses. The UK, Japan and the US are on the lower end of investing rates for
the developed world. Brazil, Hungary and Russia have some of the lowest investment rates in the emerging
world (with investment in Brazil and Hungary particularly depressed and much of the investment in Russia
oriented toward resources and related infrastructure). When you consider how inexpensive it is to make
investments in many emerging countries, how limited their existing stock of capital is, and how early they are in
adopting existing technologies, not to mention building their own, India and China really stand out. On the
flipside, we become more concerned about the US and Japan maintaining their technology advantage when we
consider their expense and their lower levels of investment. (The innovativeness of countries is a question we
return to in culture, and on that dimension both countries look more promising.)

Investing Subcomponents: Aggregate Fixed Investment Rates
The impact of investing on long-term prosperity takes time to flow through, so when we look at investment rates
in a country we want to see what the trend has been, not just what happened recently. And we want to pay
attention to the level of investment rates, not the wiggles. Moreover, not all types of investment produce
income. While it’s hard to assess that well, one thing we know is that real estate investments are generally not
productivity enhancing, so we want to exclude those as best we can.
For these reasons we measure the rate of investment for a given country by looking at the average level of fixed
investment as a percentage of GDP in the economy over the last seven years, stripping out residential real estate.
As highlighted above, on this measure China is ranked at the top. The US and Germany are towards the
bottom—investment levels in those countries stagnated for some time. The impact of adjusting for cost puts
India at the top just above China, but Germany and the US remain near the bottom, and Japan is modestly above
them.

Investing Subcomponents: Household Savings Rates
Savings provide financing for investments, so measuring savings provides another perspective into the resources
a country has to productively invest. When you look at a country that is saving a lot when it is still poor, that is
the period that its savings typically yield the highest productivity gains, for the reasons we have explained.
Patterns of savings also relate to countries moving through the process described previously—countries that are
fast becoming rich tend to save a lot, and richer countries past their peak tend to draw down their savings.
We measure the propensity for households to save by looking at average household savings as a percentage of
household income over the last seven years.
Once again, China and India rank at the top for household savings. Major European countries measure as having
fairly high household savings rates relative to other developed countries, while household savings rates in the US
are notably lower. Adjusting for cost levels again exacerbates the differences between the emerging and
developed world along this dimension, with the high level of Indian and Chinese savings standing out and savings
rates in the US and Japan quite low.

Culture Components
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country’s workers misses the role that the culture plays in
determining how much a country will grow. As I’ve discussed, culture influences the decisions people make
about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously
shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such
influences on whether countries underperform or outperform. While some people shy away from examining
culture because it is perceived as a sensitive subject and/or that it’s difficult to measure, I think those views are
mistaken. I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t look at culture objectively as we do any other element of an
economy; also, it can be well measured. I think that it’s unfortunate that this important influence on economic
well-being has not been well studied.
To be clear, I don’t mean to judge whether a culture is good or bad any more than I could judge whether working
hard is a better way to live one's life than savoring the pleasures of life. I am, however, confident that people who
prefer savoring life over working hard will work and produce differently in ways that we should understand.
Similarly, it makes intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve
are more likely to succeed than countries that don't. Countries can also outperform if the people in them are
more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and more commercially minded in harvesting
them. It makes fundamental sense that countries will underperform if they are corrupt, bureaucratic or if the rule
of law is unsound. In this section we will look at the relationships between measures of such factors and future
growth, and we will examine how different countries stack up against these measures and what that implies for
their future growth rates.
Some additional observations worth noting are as follows: people in poorer countries typically appear to value
achieving because they need to work hard to sustain themselves, but as countries get richer, people tend to put
more emphasis on enjoying their success. On an individual level, people spend more time relaxing; nationally,
you can see it in countries turning away from policies that maximize growth towards policies that try to make
society more equal or protect the environment. There is a strong correlation between the quality of a system’s
institutions (whether the system works) and a country’s level of income. Similarly, richer countries seem more
innovative because they can afford to invest more in conducting research or educating researchers, and
developed capital markets in rich countries make it easier to start businesses and reap the potential rewards.
Our goal with the culture indicator is to capture the essence of whether a country’s culture is conducive to
growth, regardless of the influence of their stage of development. So, for each dimension of our culture gauge,
we take out the effect of income on that dimension (using income as a proxy for the country’s development
stage).
For the reasons we have described above, the culture gauge focused on the elements of culture we believe
matter most for a country’s future growth: 1) self-sufficiency, 2) savoring life versus achieving, 3) whether their
society fosters innovation and commercialism, 4) bureaucracy, 5) corruption and 6) rule of law. For simplicity
we put equal weight on each of our culture indicators, which balances measures related to the motivations of the
individual and how the system operates. Because we took out the effect of income, each of the pieces is
correlated to growth without being correlated at all to the income level of the country. The table below
summarizes our weighting of the various gauges. Overall this gauge is about 58% correlated with future growth.

Again, the way we think about culture is that a country’s competitiveness and productivity is mainly a function of
its value proposition, but culture can be a drag or additional boost. So we use our gauge of culture to adjust our
measure of a country’s productivity by shifting it up or down based on whether the country’s culture is likely to
be a pressure for the country to perform above or below its potential (we call it a “bump” for lack of a better
term).
Below we look at our culture indicator’s current readings before diving into its individual pieces and describing in
more depth our logic behind them.

Culture shifts our predictions for future growth some. Based on this gauge, culture is the strongest support to
growth in Asia, particularly in Singapore, India, Thailand, Korea, and China. Singapore’s culture is strong across
all four of our measures. In contrast, China’s institutions aren’t nearly as effective (due to bureaucracy and
corruption), but China’s culture shows an extremely strong work ethic, desire to achieve and self-sufficiency. For
Korea, its orientation toward innovation and work ethic offset relatively weak institutions. The US stands just
behind Korea with a highly innovative spirit and achievement orientation, but with a system that prioritizes
redistribution over maximizing growth. Culture is a more moderate support in Japan, more neutral in the rest of
the English-speaking developed world and Germany, and a drag in Latin America and most European countries,
especially the periphery. In Europe’s periphery, corruption, a focus on savoring life, relatively low self-sufficiency,
and stagnant commercial and scientific environments appear to be a material drag on growth. Russia and
Argentina, two of the countries where our measures of what you pay versus what you get are attractive, also
score near the bottom of the list because of corruption in Russia, and low self-sufficiency and a high value on
savoring life relative to achieving in Argentina.386

Again, what we are showing is the adjustment (or “bump”) to the productivity estimate we make based on a country’s culture (e.g., based
on our assessment of what you pay for what you get for Singapore’s labor, we would project growth in income per worker of about 2.3%, but
we add another 1.3% based on our assessment that Singapore’s culture is very supportive to growth).

Self-Sufficiency
It is both logical and consistent with the evidence to believe that self-sufficiency (i.e., the need and the ability to
independently support oneself) is an important ingredient for individuals and societies to be successful. It is not
controversial to say that people spend the money that they earn differently than the money that others give
them—i.e., that the connection between earning and spending is a healthy one. If people have to earn money to
spend it, they have to be more productive. Over the long run, living standards rise as a function of increases in
productivity. So, it is not a big leap to presume that countries with greater amounts of self-sufficiency do better
than those with less. Since self-sufficiency creates capability and independence in addition to fostering
increased production, it also produces self-esteem. For these reasons, it is logical to conclude that self-reliance
is rewarding, both economically and psychologically. The evidence clearly shows this to be true.
Below, we show how self-sufficiency varies by country and how it has been correlated with subsequent economic
growth. You will see that there are significant differences in self-sufficiency levels between countries and that
these differences occur for different reasons. For example, in some cases they are chosen (e.g., the amounts of
transfer payments developed economies have are largely chosen) while in other cases they are not (e.g., high
self-sufficiency in the poorest societies is primarily the result of necessity rather than choice). Nonetheless, the
evidence is clear. Societies in which individuals are more responsible for themselves grow more than those in
which they are less responsible for themselves.
To measure self-sufficiency, we weigh 50% how hard a society works and 50% the system of supports and
protections, which is a function of the magnitude of government supports and how rigid labor markets are (e.g.,
how easy it is to hire and fire). While no one of these perfectly measures self-sufficiency, together they paint a
picture that is highly indicative. Once we used the process below to construct a score, we took out the role
income plays in encouraging self-sufficiency and used the resulting measure in our culture indicator. Overall our
indicator of self-sufficiency is about 42% correlated to growth once you strip out the effect income has on selfsufficiency. Prior to excluding the income effect, our indicator of self-sufficiency was about 50% correlated to
future growth.

The charts below convey those countries that are most self-sufficient today. As shown, India and Singapore are
measured as most self-sufficient, followed by other Asian countries and Mexico. The US is towards the middle,
and European countries are the least self-sufficient. The chart below shows these ratings. Look at it to see if you
are surprised and note those surprises so that you can see what they are attributable to when we show you the
composition of our barometer. For example, you might find it notable that “communist” China has greater selfsufficiency than the capitalist US. This is the case in both outright terms and once you adjust for income.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic
Societies that are self-sufficient have a high percentage of their population working hard each day to be selfreliant. People who work hard both produce more in the near-term and generally find ways to improve faster
through time than those that care more for leisure. They also tend to exhibit a drive to earn what they consume,
which is an essential quality of being self-reliant and generally successful in a market-based system.
While we think average hours worked accomplished our basic goal within productivity of getting a gauge of how
hard people worked, here we wanted to capture a little more richness about the work ethic of each country, so
we also looked at measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country
typically take and male labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked
and labor force measures for just men because different social norms across countries around women in the
workforce distort the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is
one of the measures we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country’s income level.
When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India and Mexico.
Overall, emerging Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries,
Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries,
whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures. Once we
take into account the tendency for wealthier countries to take more leisure time, Japan really stands out as
exceptionally hard-working (as do Korea and Singapore). Argentina and Brazil move down a bit. Still, the
relative ordering of most countries is fairly stable since the differences in how hard each country works are fairly
extreme. Any way you cut it, Mexico and India remain among the hardest-working countries and workers in
Europe some of the most leisure-taking.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic – Average Hours Worked
Hard work is a sign that someone is driven to be self-reliant, that he or she has grit. This determination is
essential to having a society where self-sufficiency is promoted and rewarded. A simple way to see it is just by
looking at how many hours those who have a job put in. This gives us a sense of how hard-working the employed
members of a society are (and, more loosely, the society in aggregate). Below we zoom in on the simple
measure: the average work week (we triangulate our picture with a broader set of measures next). On this
measure we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including Thailand, India, and China. Overall, emerging
Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries, Singapore and
then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries, whereas
workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic – Labor Force Participation
Remember what we are trying to get at with this concept is the work ethic of a society, not just how much it is
actually working. Labor force participation is one indication (albeit crude) of how much a society wants to work.
It gives you a rough sense of what proportion of the society is actively looking for a job (though it may miss some
who have the drive but are in the informal economy). Because of cultural differences across countries and data
limitations, here again we are unfortunately limited to looking at male labor force participation. By and large the
emerging world has much higher male labor force participation rates than the developed world, though there are
exceptions. Brazil, India, Thailand, Mexico and China have some of the highest rates (all around 80%). There is
still a high participation of men in the workforce in Singapore (above 75%), despite its wealth. Japan has a high
male labor force participation rate among developed countries (above 70%, though its female participation is
low compared to other developed countries). This measure is a bit lower in the US and UK. Labor force
participation is lowest among men in Western Europe, particularly Italy, France and Greece (60% to 65%),
though Germany and Spain are not far behind, along with parts of Eastern Europe, especially Hungary.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic – Actual Vacation Time
How much vacation a society takes each year is just another intuitive measure of how much it values leisure
versus hard work and its rewards. When we look at this measure, the picture isn’t all that different from what we
have seen so far. Japanese workers appear to take very few vacations (about one week per year on average),
consistent with a strong work ethic reflected in our other measures. India and China are toward the top of the
list, with the average vacation time around two weeks per year. The norm in the US is about three-and-a-half
weeks. German, French and Spanish workers appear to take the most vacation, with Italian and Greek workers
not far behind. On average, Europeans take six to seven weeks of vacation per year.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic – Retirement Age as Percentage of Life
Expectancy
One dimension of how hard you work is how many days you put in each year, but another is how long you work
over the course of your lifetime. To capture this we want to look at when people tend to retire in a society
relative to their life span. We measured this by looking at the effective retirement age as a percentage of life
expectancy. Interestingly, this picture shows some notable differences from the earlier patterns we saw and
appears less related to a country’s income (a simple measure of its stage of economic development). While the
countries at the top are mostly emerging, Japan and the US are ahead of many low-income countries. Japanese
and US workers appear to work to 85% or more of their life expectancy before retiring. On the other hand,
workers in China retire much earlier, working closer to 70% of their life expectancy before retirement.
Consistent with other measures, Europeans fall in the bottom half of this measure.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports
A country’s government policy both tells you something about what it values, and also shapes the incentives and
motivations of its citizens. In general, societies that value self-reliance highly will provide less public support.
And large government supports, directly through transfers that redistribute incomes or indirectly through
services, are the primary means of enabling individuals to consume more than they earn. These supports risk
undermining self-reliance, which is such a fundamental value in a market-based system (i.e., the drive to earn
your keep). To be clear, we aren’t arguing for or against such payments; we are just measuring self-sufficiency
and, since this is one of the biggest influences on it, it is a significant part of our gauge. For these reasons, we
would expect countries that have fewer transfers, smaller welfare systems and more limited social services to
grow faster than those that place a higher priority on redistribution and government safety nets.
We measure the degree of government supports in a society in a few ways, looking at the magnitude of its
outlays (which often include indirect transfers in the way of services, for example) and the magnitude of its direct
transfers to households.
As countries develop and get richer, they tend to weigh considerations like
redistribution more heavily, so this is another measure where we expect and find a fairly strong relationship
between the country’s income and its level of government supports, which we control for to account for the stage
of development the country is in and get a sense of the underlying ethic.
In our current rankings, emerging Asia holds the top four spots, with European countries ranking as the least selfsufficient along this measure. Once you exclude the effect of income, this pattern basically holds, though the
developed English-speaking world moves up some, particularly Singapore, whose limited amount of government
supports is unusual given the wealth of the country. Italy and France end up looking particularly bad on this
measure.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports – Government Expenditures
Government outlays are a broad indication of the support a government provides to those in society. While not
direct (as, say, pure household income transfers), many of these outlays are redistributive, providing, for
example, higher-value services than what a number of recipients contributed in the form of taxes. These
measures can both reflect societal attitudes around self-reliance and impact these values. On this measure, we
see that many of the emerging Asian countries have very small governments relative to the size of their
economies. Singapore’s government spends a bit over 15% of GDP, and China's government doesn't spend that
much more, about 20%. India is a bit lower down but still in the top quartile, with government spending around
25% of GDP. There is some variation among Latin American countries, with Mexico’s government outlays at
less than 25% of GDP, and Argentina’s and Brazil’s governments closer to 35%-40%, around the middle of the
pack. Japan and the US are also in the middle. France and Italy are on the other end of the spectrum. Their
governments spend between 50% and 55% of GDP.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports – Transfers to Households
Household transfers are a direct subsidy and have an especially high risk of undermining self-reliance. The policy
highlights the tradeoff of enforcing a market-based system to maximize growth versus risking slower growth to
achieve a different goal, like ensuring a social safety net for ethical reasons or for social stability. On this
measure, we see that India’s and China’s governments are the least redistributive, by our measures. In both
countries transfers to households are around 5% of GDP. Transfers in the US and Japan are about four times
larger, around 20% of GDP, but still much lower relative to the rest of the developed world. In Western Europe,
transfers range from a bit under 25% to nearly 30% in France.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity
Support from the state to an individual can happen through either direct transfer payments and the provision of
government services (as we examined above), or by regulating companies to provide workers with supports, e.g.,
enforcing a minimum wage or making it difficult to fire individuals. Unions can also work to protect certain
workers. To the extent that these structural labor market supports limit companies from engaging with
employees in a free manner (making hiring and firing decisions), it limits the need for individual self-reliance.
And this approach limits the dynamism of corporations and individuals to respond to conditions—which over
time should make countries with high rates of labor market rigidity grow more slowly.
We measure labor market rigidity by looking at unionization rates across countries, minimum wages, and limits
to hiring and firing at will in a given economy. Unlike hard work or government supports, these measures tend to
be fairly unrelated to a country’s wealth and stage of development (which we proxy with income levels).
On our aggregate measure of labor force rigidity, Singapore, India and the US rank as having the least rigid labor
forces, followed by Mexico. Argentina and Italy score especially poorly along this measure. Within the
developed world, Japan and peripheral Europe appear to have some of the more rigid labor markets. It’s also
interesting to note that China appears to have a fairly rigid labor market, which is generally the exception (most
other measures indicate that China has a high degree of self-sufficiency). Since labor force rigidity isn’t
particularly related to a county’s stage of development, excluding income’s effect has little impact on the
rankings.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity – Unionization
While unions can help give workers a voice in negotiations with their employers, they also work to protect
members from the pressures of others in the workforce and restrict overall labor force participation—all of which
undermines self-reliance. As with other measures of labor market rigidity, unionization rates have little
relationship with the income of a country. The measure shows different choices within countries of similar
income. Unionization rates are low in the US and Mexico (close to 15% and below), though it’s worth noting that
our measures don’t account for the strength of unions (which we understand to be strong in France, for
example). Unionization rates are very high in Italy, Russia and Argentina (35% and higher). This is one of the
few measures on which China ranks lower, with a unionization rate near 30%.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity – Ease of Hiring and Firing
Government protections that make it harder to hire or fire someone both increase the rigidity in the labor market
and reduce the self-sufficiency of its workers. Looking at ease of hiring/firing, the US and Singapore rate as some
of the most self-sufficient developed countries, and among the most self-sufficient of any country on this
measure. China is not far behind, still in the top quartile. Protections against firing appear to be high in Europe,
though Spain has made great strides in improving labor market flexibility through reforms over the last couple
years. Protections against firing also appear high in Latin America—Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are all in the
lower half.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity – Minimum Wage as Percentage of
Average Income
The minimum wage of a country is another indication of its labor market rigidity and emphasis on supports
versus market-based incentives and self-reliance. As with unionization rates, we again see quite a bit of
difference across countries even within the same income group. Mexico tops the list, with the US and Germany
not far behind. On the other end we see both developed countries, like Italy, and lower-income ones, like China
and Argentina, that have much higher minimum wages as a percentage of incomes.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving
It makes intuitive sense to us that those who value achievement over savoring the fruits of life will be more
successful in finding ways to work harder and smarter to become more prosperous. Of course achievement
means different things to different people. When I talk about a society that values achievement I imagine one
where its people prioritize professional success, creating thriving businesses and building economic security
versus other goals like protecting the environment or enjoying leisure. What’s more, these societies tend to be
ones where there is a faith that competition is fair and hard work will be rewarded (otherwise it’s less likely for
the people to be motivated).
To calculate our “savoring life versus achieving” gauge we put 50% weight on the measures of whether the
culture values working hard and 50% on the values expressed in an international values survey. For the first
component (the evidence we see of work ethic in things like hours worked or vacation days), we draw on the
broad measure of working hard that we discussed as part of self-sufficiency. For the latter component, the
expressed values of society, survey data is difficult to compare across countries, so we triangulated with several
different questions that were consistent with our goal of capturing the desire of people to savor what they have
or focus on achieving more. For example, we used answers to questions like, “what should the first priority be for
the future of the country,” or “economic growth is more important than the environment,” to get at how people
value further success or economic growth in relation to other values (like the environment, people having more
say in their communities, etc.). We also look at questions about whether having a good time is important relative
to accomplishing and whether the respondent thinks it’s important to be successful, which are somewhat more
direct. Lastly, questions like “competition is harmful” help us get a sense of people’s attitudes toward the type of
environment that encourages people to push to achieve. These were combined into our overall indicator of the
relative preference for savoring life versus achieving in a way that is indicated by the weights shown below. As
with self-sufficiency, there is a natural tendency for people in less developed countries to value becoming more
prosperous through hard work and achievement, compared to developed countries which are more inclined
towards leisure. Once we take into account the level of a country’s income, our indicator of savoring life versus
achieving is about 40% correlated to growth.

When we look at the picture of which countries prioritize achievement over savoring, we see the familiar
countries at the top and bottom—East Asia and the European periphery, respectively. India and Mexico score as
being most focused on achieving. The most achievement-oriented countries in the developed world are the US
and Japan by these measures. European countries focus more on savoring life than most countries in the world,
with France and Italy at the bottom. The positions change some once we take into account the effect of income,
though not all that much (the differences between the extremes are also smaller). Singapore moves up to the
top spot—when you take into account how wealthy the country is, it’s remarkable how hard-working and
achievement-oriented its people appear by our measures. India still ranks toward the top after taking into
account its income level, but its relative achievement orientation stands out as less exceptional.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponents: Observed Outcomes
One straightforward way to see whether a society values achieving over leisure is to observe the outcomes of its
choices: literally how much effort they put into work. A society whose people strive hard to achieve in a marketbased system will likely have a more vibrant, competitive business environment. These traits will make it more
likely to improve its potential than an economy which chooses to value the fruits of life instead. Often we will see
countries that have acquired great wealth and become rich begin to make this choice.
For the observed piece of the concept of savoring life versus achieving, we use our broad measure of how hardworking a country is. (As discussed, this is the same broad measure we use as part of self-sufficiency, so if it is
fresh in your mind you can skip down to the expressed values of this indicator.) As a reminder, this measure
includes a broad set of indications of a country’s work ethic, including not just the average hours worked, but also
measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country typically take, and male
labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked and labor force
measures for just men because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort
the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is one of the measures
we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country’s income level.
When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India and Mexico.
Overall, emerging Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries,
Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hard-working among developed countries,
whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures. Once we
take into account the tendency for wealthier countries to take more leisure time, Japan really stands out as
exceptionally hard-working (as do Korea and Singapore). Argentina and Brazil move down a bit. Still, the
relative ordering of most countries is fairly stable, since the differences in how hard each country works are fairly
extreme. Any way you cut it, Mexico and India remain among the hardest-working countries and workers in
Europe some of the most leisure-taking.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponent: Expressed Values
Observing the outcomes of people’s choices is one way to see whether they value achievement over savoring;
another, of course, is to ask them. You can imagine the questions you would ask. Some of the ones that are
intuitive to us are whether a society puts growth as a top priority for the country, whether it believes competition
is healthy and at a personal level whether each individual feels being very successful is important and that hard
work will lead to success. Fortunately, there is a World Values Survey that asks many questions and includes
ones like this. Naturally there are challenges comparing survey data across countries, but we believe by
triangulation across a set of intuitive questions we can come up with a pretty good indication of a country’s
expressed values, which we can then weigh against the outcomes we observe (which form the other half of our
savoring life versus achieving gauge, as discussed above).
In fact, the rankings for the expressed component show a similar picture as those we observe in measures of
work effort. India and China top this gauge for the emerging world, and Latin America is further down the list. Of
the developed world, the US values achieving most, while France and the European periphery place the most
emphasis on savoring life. This gauge is less correlated with incomes than observed measures of work effort,
which makes some sense as observed measures are a more direct way of seeing a country’s values (e.g., you can
value savoring the fruits of life but work out of necessity). When you exclude the effect of income, the US moves
to the top of achievement-oriented countries, with India just behind.

The table below shows more specific information which we triangulated to get a sense of the expressed values
toward achievement versus savoring in a given society. It’s interesting how the reasons for these cultural
attitudes differ across countries. For example, in Russia people express a lack of faith that hard work leads to
success, even though they express a desire for the country to grow, while in Canada people express a high value
on political input or environmental protection over economic growth. That said, we don’t want to make too much
of any one of these indications, since what we are trying to capture is the overall essence of whether a country is
achievement-oriented.

Innovation and Commercialism
An innovative and commercial spirit is the lifeblood of a thriving economy. The drive to tinker and invent, to
discover, to improve from prior failures—this is how people learn and find new and better ways of creating things
of value. In a market-based system, the most powerful way to drive innovation is to bring new ideas to market,
to commercialize and profit from them. The marketplace is generally efficient in weeding out the good ideas
from the bad and pricing what innovations are most valued by society. In this way the concepts of innovation
and commercialism go hand in hand. They capture whether people in a society value finding new knowledge or
creating new things, and whether their incentives are aligned to encourage them to seek a profit by
commercializing these ideas. The following statistics measure the level of innovation and commercialism in
different countries and their correlations with future growth.
We looked at a variety of measures to triangulate these concepts. For both scientific and commercial innovation,
we wanted to have a balance between indicators that captured outputs (new inventions or businesses), and
indicators that measured inputs (values, investment, and people) that we thought would logically lead to
innovation. We weigh the inputs and outputs equally. The pieces of our innovation and commercialism indicator
are shown in the following table. Overall, the raw indications of innovation and commercialism are stronger in
higher-income countries, especially measures of investment (like R&D expenditure) that require a certain level of
resources, or measures of knowledge creation (like patent creation) that require a level of acquired
knowledge. What we are focused on with our culture measures, however, are the underlying values of a society
independent of its wealth and development stage (which we proxy in a simple way with income levels). Once we
exclude the effect of income, our gauge of innovation and commercialism is 49% correlated to historical future
growth in income per capita. It’s notable that before this adjustment there is no relationship between a country’s
future growth and the level of observed innovation and commercialism.

In terms of our ratings of countries on this gauge, Korea and the US rank as being the most innovative and
commercial-minded both on an absolute basis and after we take out the effect of income. Korea invests a lot of
capital and people toward research and has reaped the rewards in the form of a high number of new patents and
royalties. Along with relatively high investment in research, Americans stand out as highly entrepreneurial.
Germany and Japan aren’t far behind, each investing high amounts of R&D and researchers into the innovation
process and seeing the benefits from things like new patents, businesses, and websites. China is roughly neutral
on our measures on an absolute basis, but it jumps to the top third once you take into account the fact that its
proportion of people creating new businesses and gross expenditure in R&D are fairly high given how poor it still
is. India is less innovative but it’s much poorer, so it moves ahead of China once you adjust for the effect of
income. Latin America and emerging Europe score in the middle to bottom end of the range whether you adjust
for the effect of income or not, especially Russia and Mexico. Once you adjust for income, Europe’s periphery
fares poorly, particularly Italy, which is at the bottom of the list. Mostly, their innovation and commercial inputs
like researchers or entrepreneurship prevalence are moderate, but those aren’t leading to the scientific or
business outputs you’d expect for countries at their income level.

Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Outputs
We would expect a country that has more innovative and commercially minded people to create more patents
and trademarks, more businesses—in other words, that it is actively creating new ideas, protecting its intellectual
property and capturing the rewards of this innovation. So we look at these outcomes as one way to get a sense
of the society’s innovative and commercial spirit. Some outcomes are more directly indicative of innovation (like
patent creation), others more direct signs of commercialism (like new businesses created or the prevalence of
entrepreneurs), and some show the signs of combining the two (like royalty fees).
When we look at these measures on their own, they are fairly related to a country’s income, which is intuitive
since rich countries tend to have more resources to invest and have higher levels of education and accumulated
knowledge, so are more likely to lead in creating innovations valued in the market. On the raw measures, you see
many poor countries at the bottom, like India or China (that might have a strong innovative spirit but you
wouldn’t expect to be leading innovators right now) behind rich countries, like France or Italy, that may actually
have less drive to find new ideas and build businesses. But when we adjust for income, both India and China
move up a lot, especially India, which appears just as innovative and commercial as the US when you account for
its stage of development. Either way you look at it, the US tops our scores for the outputs of innovation and
commercialism. After taking out the effect of income, rich countries like the US and Japan still stand out as
highly innovative. The European periphery countries (Greece, Spain and Italy) have the worst scores once you
adjust for how few new commercial innovations they’re producing in light of how rich they are. France, Brazil,
and Russia are just behind.

Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Inputs
Ultimately what matters for commercial innovation is whether there is a strong spirit of finding new things and
building new businesses in the society. Whether a country is investing its resources in new innovations and
whether it has a culture of risk-taking are good signs this spirit is strong. So to measure the inputs to innovation
we look at human and capital investment through R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the proportion of
researchers in the population. We look at entrepreneurial spirit by examining whether people express a fear of
failing in a new business endeavor in surveys and whether there is a prevalence of entrepreneurs in the
population.
As with the outputs of innovation, the innovation inputs we measure are highly correlated to income, again to be
expected since richer countries have more resources and higher levels of education to devote to finding new
ideas. To account for this and get at the underlying spirit of innovation and commercialism we simply take out
the effect of income. Here again we see India and China behind many rich countries on our raw indicators, and
then at the top of the list after taking into account their level of income; on the other hand, certain rich countries
are at the bottom of the list after excluding the effect of income—for example, Italy and France. As observed
when we looked at its score on our outcomes measure, Korea has the highest score for inputs to innovation and
commercialism. That’s because it devotes a high amount of spending and people to research while also having a
healthy amount of entrepreneurship (despite some apparent fear of business failure). Within the developed
world, the US, Germany and Japan stand out as the countries most oriented toward innovation and
commercialism, near the top of all countries. Japan stands out because of the resources it devotes—its level of
researchers relative to its population and R&D expenditure—which outweigh an apparent fear of business failure.
The US, on the other hand, is strong on all measures, with a healthy willingness to take risk.

Bureaucracy
Lots of red tape and government regulation stymie business activity. They impact the core elements of a thriving
economy by hindering people from innovating or creating new businesses, and they make running a business
burdensome, requiring people to spend time complying with unnecessary or heavy administrative controls
instead of focusing on business improvements. That’s not to say that regulation is not important—of course
good governance and the rule of law are critical to a healthy market-based economy, as we will examine
next. But excessive, time-consuming and rigid controls gum up the wheels of the economy.
To measure bureaucracy we look at measures related to the ease of starting a business (from the World
Bank/IFC), the efficiency and cost of dealing with construction permits (also World Bank/IFC) and the burden of
government regulation (from the World Economic Forum). The pieces of our bureaucracy indicator are shown in
the table below. Bureaucracy tends to be more prevalent in less developed countries and so is fairly related to
income levels. This is fairly natural for a number of reasons, because the processes are simply less efficient and
require more steps, because the market systems are less advanced or established and have more controls, or
because of inter-related factors, like weaker rule of law and a higher degree of corruption leading to more
controls that allow for rent seeking. From a growth perspective, businessmen and investors will likely accept that
a certain degree of bureaucracy is to be expected to do business in an emerging country that is otherwise
competitive. But if the bureaucracy is exceptional even relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going
to weigh on the decision to do business in that country. Once excluding the effect of income, our gauge of
bureaucracy is 32% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. Notably, it is negatively
correlated to future growth when we don’t make this adjustment. Along with our measures of the rule of law and
corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore ranks best on our gauge of bureaucracy, followed by the
English-speaking developed world. Nowhere is it easier to start a business or run one without burden from
government regulation than in Singapore according to our measures. Bureaucracy is worst in Argentina and
India and high in Russia, Brazil and China as well. Once you exclude the relationship between income and
bureaucracy, India and China don’t look quite as bad, though still below par. Europe’s periphery (Spain, Greece,
and Italy) all look highly bureaucratic given their stage of development. Italy ranks near the bottom due in
particular to the burden government regulations place on doing business. Russia scores poorly considering its
income, just a touch above Argentina.

Corruption
Corruption undermines the effectiveness of a market-based system in a variety of ways, diverting resources,
distorting incentives, raising the costs of doing business, undermining business competition and efficiency, and
creating uncertainty for investment. Corruption also both discourages profit-seeking and often impedes it. Small
types of corruption (like the bribes one may have to pay at the airport or to an administrative official) create
inefficiencies that slow down the agility of businesses, raise costs and make it more difficult to cultivate a new
business. Big forms of corruption (for example, business appropriation) create limits to financial success and
others (like large bribes to enter an industry or win a license) create entry barriers and lower prospective returns.
All forms can make a country’s system dysfunctional and create uncertainty around doing business in a given
country. In all these ways corruption undermines productivity and the capacity of a society to realize its potential.
To measure corruption, we combine Transparency International’s measures of corruption across countries with
three sub-indices from the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness index: “diversion of public funds,”
“irregular payments and bribes,” and “favoritism in decisions of government officials.” These measures help us
capture the different types of corruption (big and small). The pieces of our corruption indicator are shown in the
table below. When we look at these measures we see that poorer countries tend to have higher degrees of
corruption. That’s for a number of reasons we won’t explore in depth here, including fewer opportunities for
wealth creation, entrenched ways of operating that may have once been part of a different, non-market based
system, or weaker rule of law. Businessmen and investors will likely put up with a certain degree of corruption to
operate in an emerging country that is otherwise competitive. But if that country has an exceptionally high
degree of corruption relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going to weigh on the decision to do
business in that country. Once excluding the effect of income, our gauge of corruption is 58% correlated to
historical future growth in income per capita. Notably, the relationship is slightly negative without this
adjustment. Along with our measures of bureaucracy and the rule of law, this gauge helps us triangulate the
picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account the income level of countries, Singapore again looks best, with Japan, the Englishspeaking developed world, and Germany also near the top. Most emerging countries are toward the bottom of
our rankings, which is to be expected given the relationship between corruption and income levels we have
discussed. When we exclude how income levels are related to corruption, Latin American countries and the
European periphery are at the bottom of our ratings. Italy and Greece stand out as having the highest degree of
corruption of any of the countries we look at, followed by Russia and Argentina just behind. Italy is weak across
all measures, especially given how wealthy it is, and particularly with regard to favoritism by government
officials. India and China both face significant impediments from their levels of corruption. But when we consider
their levels of corruption relative to their levels of income, their corruption is not exceptional; in fact, it’s lower
than we would expect. Even after considering income levels, many developed countries still rate high, Singapore
in particular, but also commonwealth countries, Japan, and Germany. The US rates in the bottom third after
considering its income.

Rule of Law
A strong rule of law helps ensure fair competition in a market-based system and it protects the incentives and
efficiency of this system. When a country’s legal system can reliably and efficiently enforce agreements that
businesses make and protect people’s property and investments, the economy can function. If there are strong
disagreements, a contract broken, or a bankruptcy, a well-developed legal system makes working these things
out fair and orderly. When the government fails to do these things, investing and doing business in a country is a
lot riskier and inefficient. A strong rule of law also helps stamp out corruption and other activities that
discourage profit seeking and prevent the most highly valued products and businesses from thriving.
We measure rule of law by combining measures related to the efficiency of the legal framework in settling
disputes (WEF), property rights (WEF), protecting investors (World Bank/IFC), and enforcing contracts (World
Bank/IFC). The pieces of our rule of law indicator are shown in the table below. As with our measures of
corruption and bureaucracy, the rule of law tends to be strongly related to a country’s income. Again, we won’t
delve into all the reasons here, but it’s intuitive that countries that have less resources and less educated
populations have more immature legal systems, and the rule of law is likely compounded by interrelated factors,
like higher corruption. Here we want to look at the rule of law of a country taking into account its development
stage. That gives us a better sense of the underlying cultural elements that will determine its lawfulness as it
develops. It’s also a more helpful perspective in looking at future growth. As with our measures of bureaucracy
and corruption, we would expect that businessmen and investors will likely expect there to be lower rule of law in
poorer countries, and so it may not impact their decision to do business or invest in an emerging country that is
otherwise competitive. But if the rule of law is particularly weak in that country relative to others of similar
income, that is likely a drag. Indeed, we see no relationship between the rule of law on its own and future growth.
But once we exclude the effect of income, our gauge of the rule of law is 57% correlated to historical future
growth in income per capita. In other words, when countries still fail to uphold the rule of law once they are rich,
their cultures often appear to be holding back their growth. Along with our measures of bureaucracy and
corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore, Japan, and the English-speaking developed world are at the
top of our ranking. Despite its wealth and development stage, Italy ranks near the bottom of the list, just ahead
of Argentina, Greece, and Russia. Emerging countries also tend to perform poorly on this measure. Once we
exclude the effect of income, Italy and Greece stand out as having an especially weak rule of law. In general, the
European periphery and Latin American countries rate toward the bottom, with the rest of the developed world
and emerging Asian countries toward the top. Singapore stays at the top even after taking out income, along with
other rich nations. The US and Japan rate as having a rule of law that is just modestly strong given their levels of
income.

Summary Observations
On the basis of productivity and indebtedness alone, the countries which have the elements to grow incomes per
worker fastest today are India, China, Thailand, Singapore and Korea. Based on these elements, European
countries and Japan are expected to grow slowest. While, the different pieces that go into this view are described
above, we’ll also describe them briefly here. We expect India to grow strongly (6% or so), primarily because of
India’s low indebtedness and significant cost advantage relative to the rest of the world even accounting for its
poor education (its income per capita is just $1,000, 4x less than China’s). While incomes have grown very fast
in China and there has been a material leveraging, we still expect fairly strong growth of 5% due to China’s strong
competitive position. The Chinese labor force remains highly attractive as a result of their work ethic and how
educated they are relative to the cost, and they continue to save at a high rate, providing capital that is invested
in projects that will improve productivity in the future. China’s culture of self-sufficiency and achievement also
provides a material support. Of course the policies of these countries can shift these growth rates. Most
importantly in China the implementation of reforms and the management of the debt will be important and in
India the reforms will be important. In both cases shifts in policies should be reflected in our indices.
This formula projects productivity growth in the US to be around 1.5%-2%, in the middle of the pack globally but
ahead of most other rich nations. The US is now one of the more competitive developed world economies, with a
well-educated but expensive workforce, despite an increasing preference for leisure and very low savings rates.
While it is managing its deleveraging beautifully, it remains relatively highly indebted. We expect growth in
Germany to be a bit lower than in the US. Germany is expensive relative to the US and central bank (ECB)
stimulation has been less aggressive. At the same time, healthy household savings rates, a culture of innovation
and commercialism, and good governance are positive supports for Germany's productivity growth. And
Germany has not been reliant on credit expansion for its growth, and monetary policy is relatively stimulative
relative to German conditions. On the lowest end we see Japan and the southern European countries, all of
which are globally uncompetitive and highly indebted, and have a history of experiencing monetary policy that is
tight relative to conditions. The growth prospects of Italy and Spain, along with France and a number of Latin
American countries are also hindered by a culture that values savoring life over achievement or self sufficiency.

Part 2: Economic Health Indices by Country,
and the Prognoses That They Imply
While in Part 1 I showed economic health measures indicator by indicator, in this part I show them country by
country. By turning to the countries that you are interested in, you will be able to see all of the influences and
what they imply for economic growth over the next 10 years for each of those countries in one simple table. They
are shown in the order of projected economic growth rates and can be found by looking at the table of contents
on the next page.
The projected economic growth rates for each country are shown and attributed to a) the average annual growth
rate of the working population and b) the projected average annual change in the output per worker. The
projected change in the average annual output per worker is determined two thirds by that country's projected
productivity growth and one third by the size of its debt burdens. The determinants of each country's
productivity growth are shown in several gauges that reflect each of the drivers (e.g. cost competitiveness, work
attitudes, etc.). These are conveyed in tables that show – 1) the deviation of that country's determinant from the
world average (shown in standard deviation terms), and 2) the ranking of that country (among the 20 countries
shown) for that indicator. In other words, this one simple table will provide you virtually all that you need to
know to gauge each country's economic health and its prospects for the next 10 years. By scanning the table and
reading the accompanying text, you will be able to see a country’s biggest strengths, and biggest weaknesses.
The projections do not take into consideration exogenous factors such as the discoveries of natural resources
and wars which will influence growth rates and are beyond my ability to forecast.
The table will not provide the thinking or the individual statistics that are behind each of these gauges. Should
you wish to see the individual statistics behind these gauges, you can get them in the appendix to this section.
Unfortunately, we are not able to share the statistics underlying our indebtedness measures, which are
proprietary.
To be clear, these health indicators show where the current conditions will lead, not what is inevitable. If
countries change the influences on their health, like individuals who stop smoking and start exercising, they can
improve their prognoses. In fact, while we expect the countries that are more efficient (as measured by our
gauges) to do better than those that are less efficient, we expect those that remove their impediments to have
the biggest improvements to growth – just as China’s strong growth over the last couple decades resulted from it
ending its closed-door policy.
It should be noted that there was no subjective judgment used in coming up with these numbers, or even in
coming up with the text that explains these indicators. Both the numbers and the text were computer generated.
As explained in Part 1 my process of converting indicators into health gauge measures and in turn into
projections for growth is very straightforward. To help it to be better understood and to provide each person
with their own abilities to vary the processes in the ways they prefer, I am willing to make these statistics and
processes open to those who are interested so that they can assess the relationships and change the weights in
the ways they think are best.

India's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that India's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 7.1% to 9.2%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 1 out of 20 major economies,
and 1 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In India’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a
5.8% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 1.3%,
which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend
to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect India’s productivity to be much better than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of 9.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other
countries (implying a growth rate of 5.2% on its own). As shown below, India’s biggest relative strengths are the
value its workers provide relative to education levels and its levels of investment, and its biggest relative
problems are its level of bureaucracy and its reliance on credit flows for growth (though compared to other
countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on these measures). The various gauges and weights are shown below.
The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of
this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of
a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying
what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

India offers much better than average value, ranked 1 among the countries we measure. Its workers are very
inexpensive, even taking into consideration India's low levels of education and very poor quality of education.
Further, people in India work very hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working age works
37 hours per week (2 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are very favorable. Levels of
saving and investing are high given India's very low per capita income levels, with investment at about 14% of
GDP (15 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

India's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 2 out of 20 countries in this
culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare India to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, India is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers
have a somewhat strong work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 27%
of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. India also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring again, its work ethic is somewhat strong, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in India relative to income. We
see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including
inventions and earnings, are high. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, India has average
levels of bureaucracy and red tape, very low corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. India's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 1 out of the 20 countries we
look at. The country has a moderate amount of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
135% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither
supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally a bit stimulative.

China
China's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that China's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 5.0%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 2 out of 20 major economies, and 2
out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated
analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity or political
shocks, or wars). In China’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 5.0% growth
rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.1%, which is roughly
in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and
indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an
important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our productivity
measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no precision here).
Over the next 10 years, we expect China’s productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a
growth rate of 6.3% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries
(implying a growth rate of 2.5% on its own). As shown below, China’s biggest relative strengths are its levels of
investment and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are its
debt and debt service levels and its reliance on credit flows for growth. The various gauges and weights are
shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in

of education. Further, people in China work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of working
age works 35 hours per week (3 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about average.
Levels of saving and investing are high given China's low per capita income levels, with investment at about 30%

development. Starting with self-sufficiency, China is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a roughly average work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at
24% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. China also seems to value achieving a bit more
than savoring - again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people value

relative to income. We see the country investing very heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from

around 216% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was

Singapore
Singapore's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Singapore's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 4.2% to 4.8%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 3 out of 20 major
economies, and 1 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Singapore’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 3.5% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth
rate of 0.7%, which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven
significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in
indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we
weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there

other countries (implying a growth rate of 4.9% on its own). As shown below, Singapore’s biggest relative

sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Mexico's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 3 out of the 20 countries
we look at. The country has plenty of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 84% of
GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high
credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is generally
neutral.

Thailand
Thailand's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Thailand's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 4.0% to 4.9%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 5 out of 20 major
economies, and 4 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Thailand’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 4.2% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of -0.2%, which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is
driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while
swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time
frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third
(though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Thailand’s productivity to be much better
than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 6.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be
slightly better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.7% on its own). As shown below, Thailand’s
biggest relative strengths are its levels of investment and how hard its people work, and its biggest relative
problems are its reliance on credit flows for growth and its debt and debt service levels (though compared to
other countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on these measures). The various gauges and weights are shown
below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the
appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of
a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying
what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Thailand offers much better than average value, ranked 3 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Thailand's somewhat low levels of education and poor
quality of education. Further, people in Thailand work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of
working age works 40 hours per week (1 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are about
average. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat high given Thailand's very low per capita income levels,
with investment at about 19% of GDP (6 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Thailand's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 3 out of 20 countries in
this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Thailand to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Thailand is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a strong work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 24% of
GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Thailand also seems to value achieving a bit more than
savoring - again, its work ethic is strong, though surveys suggest that its people don't especially value
accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in
Thailand relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs
from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, according to the international
measures we are using, Thailand has very low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and very
strong rule of law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Thailand's indebtedness position is slightly better than other countries, ranked 7 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
156% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by
high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally neutral.

economies, and 5 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Argentina’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 2.5% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of 0.8%, which is well above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven
significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in
indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we
weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there
is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Argentina’s productivity to be about average compared
to most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better

Korea's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Korea's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the

accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Brazil
relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, though its outputs from
innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are
using, Brazil has very high bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat weak rule of
law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Brazil's indebtedness position is about average compared to other countries, ranked 10 out of
the 20 countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of
around 121% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was
supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary
policy is generally neutral.

United States
USA's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that USA's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 1.8% to 2.2%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 9 out of 20 major economies,
and 2 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In USA’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 1.5%
growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.2%,
which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend
to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect USA’s productivity to be about average compared to most
major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.5% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better
than other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.0% on its own). As shown below, USA’s biggest relative
strengths are its monetary policy and its level of innovation/commercialism, and its biggest relative problems are
its debt and debt service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below.
The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of
a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying
what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

USA offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 12 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
neither expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration USA's high levels of education and about average
quality of education. Further, people in USA don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male
of working age works 24 hours per week (14 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are
unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given USA's high per capita income levels, with
investment at about 14% of GDP (14 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

USA's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years because it is ranked 6 out of 20 countries in this
culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare USA to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, USA is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers
have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 40%
of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. USA also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, though surveys suggest that its people highly value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat strong in USA relative to income. We
see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including
inventions and earnings, are high. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, USA has
somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat high corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law relative to
its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that

countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
312% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by
low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally a bit stimulative.

Russia's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Russia's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 1.5%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 11 out of 20 major economies, and 8
out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computer-generated
analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity or political
shocks, or wars). In Russia’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 2.5% growth
rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -1.0%, which is
well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and
indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an

Australia's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Australia's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in

economies, and 4 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Australia’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 0.6% growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of 0.7%, which is somewhat above other major economies. The growth in output per worker is
driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while
swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time

a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Australia's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 11 out of 20 countries in
this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Australia to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Australia is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a roughly average work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays
at 37% of GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Australia also seems to value savoring about
the same as it values achieving - again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people
value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in
Australia relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation,
and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international
measures we are using, Australia has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption,
and average rule of law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Australia's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 16 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
300% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither
supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally neutral.

Canada
Canada's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Canada's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 1.1% to 1.4%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 13 out of 20 major
economies, and 5 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Canada’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 0.9% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of 0.2%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is
driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while
swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time
frame, we weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third
(though there is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Canada’s productivity to be somewhat
worse than most major countries (implying a growth rate of 0.6% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be
about average compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.4% on its own). As shown below,
Canada’s biggest relative strengths are its rule of law and its level of corruption relative to income, and its biggest
relative problems are how hard its people work and the value its workers provide relative to education levels. The
various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in
Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of
a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying
what we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Canada offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 16 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
somewhat expensive, even taking into consideration Canada's somewhat high levels of education and very good
quality of education. Further, people in Canada don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average
male of working age works 24 hours per week (13 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce
are very unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Canada's high per capita income
levels, with investment at about 18% of GDP (7 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how

Canada's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years because it is ranked 10 out of 20 countries in this
culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Canada to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Canada is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays
at 46% of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Canada also seems to value savoring a bit more than
achieving - again, its work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value
accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Canada
relative to income. We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its
outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international
measures we are using, Canada has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and
somewhat strong rule of law relative to its income.

computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Germany’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 1.5% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of -0.7%, which is well below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven
significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in
indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we

and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Hungary offers around average value, ranked 9 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat
inexpensive, taking into consideration Hungary's about average levels of education and poor quality of education.
Further, people in Hungary don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average male of
working age works 21 hours per week (16 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are
unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Hungary's about average per capita income
levels, with investment at about 15% of GDP (11 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Hungary's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 13 out of 20 countries in
this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Hungary to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Hungary is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 50% of
GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Hungary also seems to value savoring much more than achieving again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Hungary relative to income.
We see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from
innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, according to the international measures we are
using, Hungary has average levels of bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat weak
rule of law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Hungary's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 18 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
193% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by
low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally neutral.

Spain
Spain's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Spain's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 0.1% to 0.5%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 17 out of 20 major
economies, and 8 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Spain’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 0.6% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth
rate of -0.1%, which is roughly in line with other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven
significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long-term productivity matters most, while swings in
indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the short-term. Given we are looking at a 10 year time frame, we
weigh our productivity measures about two thirds and our indebtedness measure about one third (though there
is no precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Spain’s productivity to be much worse than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of -0.4% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other
countries (implying a growth rate of 1.4% on its own). As shown below, Spain’s biggest relative strengths are its
monetary policy and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and
debt service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The
individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this section, and listed in the appendix of this

and 11 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity

which is somewhat below other major economies. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences which are conveyed in gauges that are made up of
a composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness is mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Greece offers around average value, ranked 11 among the countries we measure. Its workers are neither
expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration Greece's somewhat high levels of education and poor quality
of education. Further, people in Greece don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor - the average
male of working age works 25 hours per week (12 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce
are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Greece's about average per capita
income levels, with investment at about 9% of GDP (20 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Greece's culture looks to be a significant headwind to growth in coming years because it is ranked 19 out of 20
countries in this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Greece to countries of similar levels of
economic development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Greece is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing
that its workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 51%
of GDP), and its labor markets are moderately flexible. Greece also seems to value savoring a bit more than
achieving - again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment
and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very weak in Greece relative to income. We
see the country investing lightly in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions
and earnings, are very low. Finally, according to the international measures we are using, Greece has somewhat
high bureaucracy and red tape, very high corruption, and very weak rule of law relative to its income.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle-there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to
future growth. Greece's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 20 out of the 20 countries
we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 320% of
GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor
depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally neutral.

Appendix: List of Statistics that Make Up Our Gauges
Below, we share all of the individual indicators that make up our productivity gauges, showing the most recent reading for each country. Countries that score
best on the measure appear on the left, and countries that score worst are on the right. For further discussion of these concepts and gauges, see Part 1.
Regrettably, we can’t share the statistics underlying our proprietary indebtedness gauges.

Part 3: The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the
Last 500 Years
As mentioned above, productivity, indebtedness and luck (e.g., whether one has wars or natural resources)
explain differences in countries’ relative performance. This part looks at how different countries’ shares of the
world economy have changed and why the drivers discussed above caused these changes to occur, with a
particular emphasis on the period since 1820. As I explain below, the rises and declines in countries’ shares of
the world economy occur as a result of very long-term cycles that are not apparent to observers who look at
economic conditions from a close-up perspective.
The Past 500 Years
To begin, let’s look at how the world economic pie has been divided up over time and why it has changed. The
table below shows the shares of world GDP by major countries and/or regions at various points in time going
back to 1500. Scan that table to see how these shares have evolved over time. Note how China and India were
the largest economies from 1500 through 1820, how the United States was nothing and how what people now
call the emerging world was much bigger than what they now call the developed world.

Though the table goes back to 1500—i.e., to eight years after Columbus “discovered America”—we won’t track
the changes since then, but we will track them back to 1820. As shown:
•

In 1820 China and India were the biggest economic powers. Their shares declined as they became
decadent387 and overly indebted. As a result they were overtaken, both economically and militarily, by the
emerging British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century.

•

From the second half of the 19th century until the early 20th century, England and other Western
European countries emerged to become the world’s dominant powers and the United States
moved from being an undeveloped country to an emerging country. The emergence of the British

Empire and other European powers to dominance was fueled by two big waves of productivity growth
called the Industrial Revolution.
•

During the years from 1914-45 the British Empire gained relative to other Western European
countries and lost relative to the emerging American Empire. This was largely the result of 1)
European countries’ rivalries leading them to two costly wars that left them indebted and crippled, and 2)
the increasing “decadence” of the wealthy European powers. Because the British won these wars they
benefited in relation to their European rivals (especially Germany); however, they became overly indebted
and suffered economically relative to the United States because of them. At the same time the United
States was an emerging power largely as the result of its great productivity gains.

•

In the mid-20th century the United States emerged to become the world’s dominant economic
power and the British Empire crumbled. That was primarily the result of World War II because the
economic and other setbacks of the war were greatest in England, Western Europe, Japan, China, India, and
other emerging countries.

•

From the mid-20th century (i.e., the immediate post-World War II period of 1945-55) until the
beginning of the new millennium (2000-2010) the United States remained the dominant power,
though its share declined steadily as other countries reemerged. From 1950 to 1970 the
reemergence of Japan and Germany occurred as they recovered from the war setbacks. In the 1970-80
period, relative growth became strongest in what then became known as “emerging countries”— Latin
America (due to the 1970s commodity boom) and the “Asian 4 Tigers” (as they entered the world markets
as competitive producers and exporters). Then in the 1980-present period, great productivity gains in
China (as a result of its “open-door” and “market-oriented” policies) and India (as a result of reductions in
its bureaucracy and its opening up) allowed them to reemerge. At the same time the United States became
overly indebted as a result of its “decadence” and its declining competitiveness.

•

Now about half of world GDP is produced in what people now call the “developed world” (US,
Europe, Japan, UK, Canada and Australia) with about equal amounts being produced in the US and
Europe, and about half of world GDP is produced in what people now call “emerging countries”
with about half of that being produced in China and India.

•

For reasons explained previously, I believe that in another 15-20 years emerging countries will
produce about 70% of global GDP, China will produce about 25%, and India will produce about
12%, as they did in the mid-19th century.

Since 1900
While in the past civilizations rose and declined over several hundred years, more recently (over the last couple
of hundred years), these cycles have taken 100-150 years. That means to observe a few cycles you’d have to go
back a few hundred years. However, that’s beyond the scope of this exercise, so I will start in 1900. The chart
below shows the US share of world GDP going back to 1900. It shows how World War II catapulted the US
relative share to an abnormally high level as the result of a number of the other major countries (e.g., Europe,
Japan, China and Russia) being set back by the war and the gradual adjustment back to more normal levels. In
addition to the war effects benefiting the relative position of the US, inefficient economic systems and/or political
bureaucracies in some countries (China, Russia and India) caused these countries’ recoveries to be slower than
normal until recent years.

What Caused These Changes?
As mentioned, over the last couple of hundred years these changes have been due to a) productivity growth, b)
debt cycles, and c) other shocks and distortions (e.g., wars, the good or bad luck of having natural resources,
political shifts, etc.).
Over the very long run one gets to spend what one earns, which is a function of one’s productivity. For a country
as a whole, the earnings will equal a) the number of workers, times b) the number of hours worked, times c) the
output per hour worked. In order to be more productive, you have to work either harder or smarter. Over the
shorter run, one can spend an amount that is different than the amount one earns because of borrowing and
lending. Human nature (i.e., culture) plays a big role determining people’s productivity and indebtedness. Over
long time frames the drive for higher living standards motivates people to implement changes to get around their
impediments, which goes on until people’s earnings gravitate toward their potential/equilibrium levels and levels
of productivity and indebtedness change in ways that shift income growth. I examined the cause-effect linkages

of productivity and indebtedness previously, but here I will lay out the concepts and walk you through the logic of
how shifts in productivity and indebtedness lead to big cycles in which countries prosper and which ones don’t.
All else being equal, per capita incomes of countries will tend to converge because, in a competitive world, buyers
of goods, services and labor shift their demands away from those who are expensive to those who offer better
value, which creates a labor rate arbitrage. But all things are not equal. Differences and barriers often exist that
justify income differences. Based on our research, the most important of these differences that account for most
income gaps are in culture, education, economic and political systems, savings and investment rates,
indebtedness, and remoteness of location.388 Also, trade and capital control barriers can stand in the way of
economic competition that brings about income conversion. If these economic barriers are temporary in nature
(e.g., war damage) the forces behind this labor rate arbitrage will get rid of them (e.g., there will be rebuilding). If
the impediments are more permanent in nature (e.g., culture, remoteness of location, etc.), the forces behind the
arbitrage won’t be able to overcome them, even over very long periods. Additionally, long-term debt cycles play a
big role in driving these cycles. When debt levels are low relative to income levels and are rising, the upward
cycle is self-reinforcing until debt levels become too high for this to continue, when the reverse occurs.
For these reasons, when I see big differences in income and indebtedness, I ask myself whether the impediments
are temporary or more permanent in nature—e.g., are there good reasons that an average Chinese earns 1/10th as
much as an average American?—and I imagine the changes that will have to occur to bring this labor rate
convergence about (e.g., building infrastructure, changing laws, bringing in capital, etc.), and I try to visualize the
ripple effects of these changes (e.g., buying more commodities, creating more pollution) and the likelihood of
these things happening. I believe that’s where the big investment opportunities of the century lie.
Not all important changes are due to economic influences because not all competition is economic. For example,
throughout history war has frequently been an important means of competing and, when wars happen, they
typically impede the labor rate arbitrage.

388

By remoteness of location, I am referring to when some people are in locations that are too removed from their competitors, either
geographically or technologically, to allow them to compete. For example, populations that are located down a river, up a mountain or beyond
distances that can be cost-effectively bridged to allow these people to compete are too remote. Similarly, people who do not have access to
proper resources to compete (e.g., education) are too remote to allow the force of the labor arbitrage to work. In places like China, India, and
Africa, large percentages of the population are too remote to compete, while other portions of their populations are well positioned to
compete, so that the average incomes will be affected by both..

Since the previously shown table and charts are based on both the number of people in the country and their
average incomes, and average incomes are more relevant in seeing how countries compete, let’s look at their
relative incomes. The chart below shows per capita GDPs as a percent of the highest per capita GDP since 1900.
As shown:
•

Until the end of World War II, the UK had the highest per capita income. It was then replaced
by the US. This shift represented the end of the British Empire and the emergence of the
American Empire. I will examine this later.
Prior to World War II, developed countries other than Japan typically had incomes that were
about 70% of the top income country. For reasons explained later, the country with the
greatest total income has also typically been the reserve currency country and has derived
income benefit from being in this position; this accounts for a significant part of the gap
between the top income earning country (the UK prior to the mid-20th century and the US
after then) and the other developed countries. Note how the shock of World War II sent other
developed countries’ incomes down to only 40% of the top earner (the US) and how, in the 25
years that followed World War II, average incomes in these countries normalized to 70%80% of the top earning country.
Prior to World War II, the average income in Japan ranged around 25%-35% of the top
earner. Then the shock of World War II brought it down to around 15%. After the war it
recovered to about 90% of the top (US) in 1990 (at its bubble’s peak). Since then, it has
slipped back to about 75% of the top, which is also where the UK and other European
countries’ average incomes are. The long-term shift from an average income of 25%-35% of
the top earner to about 75% now has largely been due to Japan opening up to the world
economy so that it could compete in it.
Other emerging countries have had their average incomes vary between about 25% and 35%
of the top since 1900. I believe that this is because of some fairly long-lasting structural
impediments that vary by country and that would require too great of a digression to explain
here.
Per capita incomes in China have ranged from 2% to 18% of the top earner over the last 110
years and are now growing at a pace that is comparable with Japan’s pace in 1950-70 for
essentially the same reasons. Because of the remoteness of a large segment of the
population, I don’t expect per capita incomes in China to reach developed country levels for
the foreseeable future; however, I expect income growth rates to remain strong and reach
developed country levels for hundreds of millions of Chinese in another 25 years. Per capita
incomes in Russia have ranged from 16% to 42% of the top earner over the last 110 years and
have increased from 17% to 30% over the last 10 years.

The Importance of Human Nature in Making Choices
While productivity and indebtedness can be said to be the drivers, it is primarily people’s choices that determine
their levels of productivity and indebtedness, so psychology is of prominent importance. It is psychology that
drives people’s desires to work, borrow, consume, and go to war. Since different experiences lead to different
psychological biases that lead to different experiences, etc., certain common cause-effect linkages drive the
typical cycle. While I will describe what I believe is the typical cycle, of course no cycle is exactly typical.
The Life Cycle of a Typical Empire
As explained, economic conditions affect human nature and human nature affects economic conditions. This
typically happens dynamically in a sequence that leads countries to rise and fall for largely the same reasons that
families rise and fall over 3 to 5 generations. I believe that countries typically evolve through five stages of the
cycle:
1)

In the first stage countries are poor and think that they are poor.
In this stage they have very low incomes and most people have subsistence lifestyles, they don’t waste
money because they value it a lot, and they don’t have any debt to speak of because savings are short
and nobody wants to lend to them. They are undeveloped.
Some emerge from this stage and others don’t, with culture and location being the biggest determinants
of which emerge and which don’t, as these influence people’s desires and abilities to compete. For
example, in China large percentages of the population are too removed to compete and are likely to
remain so for the foreseeable future, so while it is reasonable to expect Chinese incomes in the major
cities to approach those in other major cities elsewhere in the world, it is unreasonable to expect the
average income of a Chinese person to equal that of an American, or for that matter someone in Beijing,
in the foreseeable future.
Those that transition from this stage to the next stage typically gradually accumulate more money than
they need to survive, and they save it because they are worried about not having enough in the future.
Because they have very low incomes, their labor costs are typically low, so when they begin to emerge,
their economic growth is led by them producing low-value-added goods cheaply and selling to rich
countries. Because they are low-cost producers, they also typically attract foreign direct investment
from companies that want to manufacture in low-cost countries to export to the rich countries (if they
are politically stable). These low-cost countries have to provide high returns to attract these investors
because of the perceived risks, but they are capable of providing these high returns because they are
very cost-effective producers.
At this stage in their development, their currencies and capital markets are undeveloped. As a result,
their governments peg their exchange rates to gold or whatever the obvious relevant reserve currency is
(typically of the currency bloc that they want to sell their goods to), and their citizens, who gradually
accumulate income in excess of spending, typically save/invest in their businesses and by buying hard
assets like apartments as savings. Those in these countries who have more money and a more global
perspective typically want to invest some money outside the country just to be safe, so they invest in
whatever they perceive to be the world’s safest investments, most typically government debt in the
world’s reserve currencies. Because people in this stage value earning money and building savings more
than spending money, their governments generally prefer their currencies to be undervalued rather than
to be overvalued, and they like to build up their savings/reserves. How fast countries evolve through this
stage primarily depends on their cultures and their abilities. I call these countries early-stage emerging
countries.

2) In the second stage countries are rich but still think they are poor.
At this stage they behave pretty much the same as they did when they were in the prior stage but,
because they have more money and still want to save, the amount of this saving and investment rises
rapidly. Because they are typically the same people who experienced the more deprived conditions in
the first stage, and because people who grew up with financial insecurity typically don’t lose their
financial cautiousness, they still a) work hard, b) have export-led economies, c) have pegged exchange
rates, d) save a lot, and e) invest efficiently in their means of production, in real assets like gold and
apartments, and in bonds of the reserve countries.
Because their exchange rates remain undervalued, their labor rates and their domestic costs are cheap
so they remain competitive. Their competitiveness is reflected in their strong balance of payments, and
incomes and net worths rising as fast as or faster than their debts.
Countries in this stage experience rapidly rising income growth and rapidly rising productivity growth at
the same time. In the early stages rapid income growth is matched by rapid productivity growth so
inflation is not a problem despite the fast increases in incomes and money in the economy. Because of
rapidly rising productivity, these countries can also become more competitive in relation to others.
During this stage, these countries’ debts typically do not rise significantly relative to their incomes and
sometimes they decline. It is a very healthy period.
However, they eventually transition to a stage in which debts rise faster than incomes and incomes rise
faster than productivity. Inflation rates rise because rapidly rising income growth leads to rapidly
increasing spending on many items that cannot be correspondingly increased in supply via productivity
gains. Additionally, by having their currencies linked to reserve currencies, they also link their interest
rates to those of the reserve currency countries, who have slower income growth and lower inflation
rates. While these interest rates are appropriate for the sluggish growth, low inflation countries, they are
too low for the faster growth, higher inflation countries. As a result, these emerging countries have
interest rates that are low in relation to their inflation and nominal growth rates. This fuels money and
credit growth and inflation. Typically countries in this stage maintain their pegged exchange rates and
linked monetary policies via changes in reserves until the upward inflationary/bubble pressures and
trade protectionist pressures become too great.
The transition from this stage to the next stage is typically signaled by a) debt growth significantly
outpacing income growth, b) accelerating inflation arising from productivity growth not increasing fast
enough to offset the increased spending and income growth, c) overinvestment, and d) balance of
payments surpluses. This mix of conditions eventually leads to movement to independent
currency/monetary policies.389 This transition to an independent currency policy typically occurs as
both a practical necessity and an earned right. As previously mentioned, countries in this second stage
run basic balance of payments surpluses that either drive up their exchange rates and/or lead their
central banks to lower their real interest rates (which fuels bubbles and inflations) and/or drive up their
foreign savings/reserves. So, practical necessity motivates these governments to abandon their pegs
and appreciate when they want to curtail inflation and/or bubbles; at the same time, international
tensions arising from trade imbalances leading to the loss of jobs in the developed country and capital
outflows from that country (e.g., as existed in the US in 1970) also motivate the move. Having an
independent currency/monetary policy is an earned right because their performance in the previous
stages that led up to this point gave them the credibility to be able to float the currency and have it
appreciate. Every country wants to have an independent monetary policy because that is the most
powerful tool available for managing the economy; it gives governments the freedom to decide how they

will balance inflation and growth in light of their own conditions.390 For these good reasons no major
developed economy has an exchange rate that is pegged to another country’s exchange rate. Only
relatively small and/or emerging economies forgo their independence because of the practical
necessities of being unable to engender enough confidence that their currencies will maintain their value
or being unable to manage monetary policy in a viable way.
In the transition to the next stage, their domestic capital markets begin to become more widely
accepted, private sector lending begins, and capital formation occurs with both foreign and domestic
investors participating in this investment boom.
You can tell countries in this stage from those in the first stage because they are the ones with gleaming
new cities and infrastructures next to old ones, they have high savings rates, they enjoy rapidly rising
incomes, and they typically have rising foreign exchange reserves. While countries of all sizes can go
through this stage, when big countries go through it they are typically emerging into great world powers.
I call these countries late-stage emerging countries.
3) In the third stage countries are rich and think of themselves as rich.
At this stage, their per capita incomes approach the highest in the world as their prior investments in
infrastructure, capital goods and R&D are paying off by producing productivity gains. At the same time,
the prevailing psychology changes from a) putting emphasis on working and saving to protect oneself
from the bad times to b) easing up in order to savor the fruits of life. This change in the prevailing
psychology occurs primarily because a new generation of people who did not experience the bad times
replaces those who lived through them. Signs of this change in mindset are reflected in statistics that
show reduced work hours (e.g., typically there is a reduction in the average work week from six days to
five) and big increases in expenditures on leisure and luxury goods relative to necessities.
Countries at this stage and in transition to the next typically become the great importers391 and have
symbiotic relationships with the emerging countries that are the great exporters, especially of low-valueadded goods. At the same time, the businesses and investors of countries in this stage increasingly look
for higher returns by investing in emerging countries where labor costs are cheaper, which further
supports the symbiotic relationship, and their capital markets and currencies develop blue-chip status
and are actively invested in by both domestic and foreign investors. They also attract the money of
investors who seek safety rather than high returns because they are perceived as safe, blue-chip
countries. In this stage, capital raising and financial market speculation picks up, largely motivated by
both the development of these markets and the good returns that they have provided up to this point.
With this development of their capital markets, increasingly spending and investing are financed by
borrowing as the prior prosperity and investment gains are extrapolated.
Countries that are large and in this stage almost always become world economic and military powers.392
They typically develop their militaries in order to project and protect their global interests. Prior to the
mid-20th century, large countries at this stage literally controlled foreign governments and created
empires of them to provide the cheap labor and cheap natural resources to remain competitive. Since
the mid-20th century, when the American Empire ruled by “speaking softly and carrying a big stick,”
American “influence” and international agreements provided access for developed countries to the

390

As recently reflected in the differences in the conditions of sovereigns that have the right to print their own currencies (e.g., the US, the UK,
etc.) and those who don’t have that right (Greece, California, etc.), this independence can make a world of difference in being able to maintain
control over one’s growth/inflation trade-offs.

emerging countries’ cheap labor and investment opportunities without requiring direct control of their
governments.
In this stage they are on top of the world and they are enjoying it. I call these countries early stage
developed countries.
4) In the fourth stage countries become poorer and still think of themselves as rich.
This is the leveraging up phase—i.e., debts rise relative to incomes until they can’t any more. The
psychological shift behind this leveraging up occurs because the people who lived through the first two
stages have died off or become irrelevant and those whose behavior matters most are used to living well
and not worrying about the pain of not having enough money. Because the people in these countries
earn and spend a lot, they become expensive, and because they are expensive they experience slower
real income growth rates. Since they are reluctant to constrain their spending in line with their reduced
income growth rates, they lower their savings rates, increase their debts and cut corners. Because their
spending continues to be strong, they continue to appear rich, even though their balance sheets
deteriorate. The reduced level of efficient investments in infrastructure, capital goods and R&D slow
their productivity gains. Their cities and infrastructures become older and less efficient than those in the
two earlier stages. Their balance of payments positions deteriorate, reflecting their reduced
competitiveness. They increasingly rely on their reputations rather than on their competitiveness to fund
their deficits. They typically spend a lot of money on the military at this stage, sometimes very large
amounts because of wars, in order to protect their global interests. Often, though not always, at the
advanced stages of this phase, countries run “twin deficits”—i.e., both balance of payments and
government deficits.
In the last few years of this stage, bubbles frequently occur. By bubbles I mean rapidly increasing debtfinanced purchases of goods, services and investment assets. These bubbles emerge because investors,
businessmen, financial intermediaries, individuals and policy makers tend to assume that the future will
be like the past so they bet heavily on the trends continuing. They mistakenly believe that investments
that have gone up a lot are good rather than expensive so they borrow money to buy them, which drives
up their prices more and reinforces this bubble process. As their assets go up in value their net worths
and spending/income levels rise, which increases their borrowing capacities, which supports the
leveraging-up process, and so the spiral goes until the bubbles burst.393 Bubbles burst when the income
growth and investment returns inevitably fall short of the levels required to service these debts. More
often than not they are triggered by central bankers who were previously too easy (i.e., that allowed the
bubble to develop by allowing debt growth to increase much faster than income growth) tightening
monetary policies in an attempt to rein them in. The financial losses that result from the bubble bursting
contribute to the country’s economic decline.
Whether due to wars394 or bubbles or both, what typifies this stage is an accumulation of debt that can’t
be paid back in non-depreciated money, which leads to the next stage.
I call these countries late stage developed countries. While countries of all sizes can go through this
stage, when big countries go through it they are typically approaching their decline as great empires.
5) In the last stage of the cycle they typically go through deleveraging and relative decline, which they are
slow to accept.

393

Japan in 1988/90, the US in 1929, the US in 2006/07, Brazil and most other Latin American commodity producers in 1977-79 were classic
examples.

After bubbles burst and when deleveragings occur, private debt growth, private sector spending, asset
values and net worths decline in a self-reinforcing negative cycle. To compensate, government debt
growth, government deficits and central bank “printing” of money typically increase. In this way, their
central banks and central governments cut real interest rates and increase nominal GDP growth so that it
is comfortably above nominal interest rates in order to ease debt burdens. As a result of these low real
interest rates, weak currencies and poor economic conditions, their debt and equity assets are poor
performing and increasingly these countries have to compete with less expensive countries that are in
the earlier stages of development. Their currencies depreciate and they like it. As an extension of these
economic and financial trends, countries in this stage see their power in the world decline.
These cycles have occurred for as long as history has been written. While no two cycles are identical—they vary
according to the countries’ sizes, cultures and a whole host of other influences—the fundamentals of the longterm economic cycle have remained essentially the same over the ages for essentially the same reasons that the
fundamentals of life cycles have remained the same over the ages—i.e., because of how man was built. While no
two life cycles are the same, and today’s typical life cycle is in some ways different from that of thousands of
years ago, the fundamentals remain the same. For example, while families lived in houses that were different
ages ago, the cycle of children being raised by parents until they are independent, at which point they work and
have their own children which they do until they get old, stop working and die, was essentially the same
thousands of years ago. Similarly, while monetary systems were different ages ago (e.g., gold coins were once
money), the cycle of building up too much debt until it can’t be serviced with hard money prompting those who
manufacture money to make more of it (e.g., reducing the gold content in the coins) is fundamentally the same.
Because these cycles evolve slowly over long time frames—over at least 100+ years—they are imperceptible to
most people. They are also essentially irrelevant to rulers who typically have time horizons of a couple of years.
As a result, they are not controlled, which is the main reason that they are destined to occur. If human nature
were different so that debt growth didn’t outpace income growth and income growth didn’t outpace productivity
growth, these cycles would be pretty much eliminated.
Example: The Ascent and Decline of the British Empire
I will explain my view of the ascent and decline of the British Empire both because it is a good example of the
previously described process and because it sets the stage for the rise and early decline of the US Empire and
what I believe will be the rise and decline of the Chinese Empire.
As with all history, different people will attribute the ascent and decline of the British Empire to different causes,
so keep this in mind when reading my theory.
It is pretty well agreed that the ascent of the British Empire began in the late 18th century when the Industrial
Revolution began and the decline occurred in the middle of the 20th century when World War II ended, so its
cycle took place over 150 years. It is also agreed that the British Empire’s decline in the mid-20th century was
accompanied by the emergence of the American Empire which has been dominant for the last 60 years. But
there are disagreements about why these things occurred.
While I won’t take you back to when the first wave of the Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th century, I will
take you back to around 1850. In my opinion, from before then until 1914 Great Britain was in stage 3 of the
previously described cycle, from 1914 to 1950 it was in stage 4, and from 1950 until around 1980 it was in stage 5
of the cycle. I will show why I believe this in the charts that follow.

To begin, the chart below shows the geographic size of the British Empire going back to 1860. Note how it rose
from 1860 until 1920, flatted out until 1950 and then collapsed. By comparing this chart with the one that follows
showing relative incomes, you will note that the size of the British Empire correlated with the level of its relative
income. In the charts that follow, you will also see that it correlates with sterling’s stature as a reserve currency
and that this changed due to the reasons explained in my description of the long-term economic cycle.

Note that sterling’s share of world reserves accounted for more than 50% until 1950 and declined to about 5%
over the next fifty years.395 As previously mentioned, when empires are at their peaks, their currencies attain
reserve currency status which allows them to over-borrow, which leads to their declines.

As previously explained, in the third stage of the cycle, when growth and competitiveness are strong and
indebtedness is low, the currency is strong and the country’s reserve currency status is enhanced; however, in the
fourth stage the reverse is true. In other words, in the fourth stage the currency suffers due to over-indebtedness,
increased money creation and uncompetitiveness, and this leads to the reduced desire to hold the currency. The
next charts show the value of sterling both against the US dollar and against gold. Note that sterling was rocksolid until World War I and then it was devalued quickly against both the dollar and against gold.

The decline of the British Empire can be seen via the worsening of its twin deficits.
The next chart shows the UK current account and trade balance going back to 1850. Note that:
•

The UK ran a strong current account surplus of about 8% of GDP until 1913, which was just prior to
World War I, and then suffered steady declines worsened by both wars that led it to run large deficits
(hitting 10% of GDP) at the end of World War II.
Through most of this time (which starts in 1850, which was well into its ascent), it ran trade deficits
while running current account surpluses because of the significant income earned from global asset
holdings (both from colonies, and increasingly in the late 19th century from assets in the US) and the
profits made from global shipping and financial businesses.
After the First and Second World Wars, it was left with large debts owed to foreigners and without its
colonies, which weakened the current account surplus significantly.

deficits typically shoot up for two reasons: 1) in deleveragings, when increased government spending needs to
make up for decreased private sector spending, and 2) in wars. Note the effects of the two wars. Also note that
the budget deficit as a percent of GDP is now the highest since World War II (because of the deleveraging).

In a nutshell, at the end of World War II Great Britain was bankrupt and the US was in a strong financial
condition. As a result, the US provided the Marshall Plan, the British Empire collapsed and the UK began a long
deleveraging.

Appendix: How the UK Deleveraging Transpired
As shown in a previous chart, the debt to GDP ratio fell from about 400% of GDP in 1947 to about 150% of GDP
in 1970. How did that occur? As mentioned, in deleveragings, nominal interest rates must be kept below
nominal GDP growth rates (otherwise debt to income ratios would rise even without debt growth financing
increased spending) and real interest rates must be kept low, so that the rates of money growth and currency
depreciation that are required to bring that about will occur. The table below shows how the most important part
of this deleveraging occurred. I broke it up into two parts – from 1947 to 1959 and from 1960 to 1969 because
they were a bit different.

As a result of these policies, the decline in total debt in the post-war period occurred via a rise in nominal GDP
which outpaced more modest increases in the amount of new borrowing. Inflation of around 4% from 1947-1970
drove nearly 2/3 of the decline in debt to GDP that is attributable to GDP growth. This is shown in the chart
below.

How the Economic Machine Works
A Template for Understanding What is Happening Now
Ray Dalio
Created October 31, 2008 | Updated March, 2012
The economy is like a machine. At the most fundamental level it is a relatively simple machine, yet it is not well
understood. I wrote this paper to describe how I believe it works. My description is not the same as
conventional economists’ descriptions so you should decide for yourself whether or not what I’m saying makes
sense. I will start with the simple things and build up, so please bear with me. You will be able to understand and
assess my description if we patiently go through it.

How the Economic Machine Works: “A Transactions-Based Approach”
An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up. A transaction is a simple thing. Because
there are a lot of them, the economy looks more complex than it really is. If instead of looking at it from the top
down, we look at it from the transaction up, it is much easier to understand.
A transaction consists of the buyer giving money (or credit) to a seller and the seller giving a good, a service or a
financial asset to the buyer in exchange. A market consists of all the buyers and sellers making exchanges for
the same things – e.g., the wheat market consists of different people making different transactions for different
reasons over time. An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets. So, while seemingly
complex, an economy is really just a zillion simple things working together, which makes it look more complex
than it really is.
For any market, or for any economy, if you know the total amount of money (or credit) spent and the total
quantity sold, you know everything you need to know to understand it. For example, since the price of any good,
service or financial asset equals the total amount spent by buyers (total $) divided by the total quantity sold by
sellers (total Q), in order to understand or forecast the price of anything you just need to forecast total $ and
total Q. While in any market there are lots of buyers and sellers, and these buyers and sellers have different
motivations, the motivations of the most important buyers are usually pretty understandable and adding them up
to understand the economy isn’t all that tough if one builds from the transactions up. What I am saying is
conveyed in the simple diagram below. This perspective of supply and demand is different from the traditional
perspective in which both supply and demand are measured in quantity and the price relationship between them
is described in terms of elasticity. This difference has important implications for understanding markets.

The only other important thing to know about this part of the Template is that spending ($) can come in either of
two forms – money and credit. For example, when you go to a store to buy something you can pay with either a
credit card or cash. If you pay with a credit card you have created credit, which is a promise to deliver money at a
later date,1 whereas, if you pay with money, you have no such liability.
In brief, there are different types of markets, different types of buyers and sellers and different ways of paying
that make up the economy. For simplicity, we will put them in groups and summarize how the machine works.
Most basically:


All changes in economic activity and all changes in financial markets’ prices are due to changes in the
amounts of 1) money or 2) credit that are spent on them (total $), and the amounts of these items sold
(total Q). Changes in the amount of buying (total $) typically have a much bigger impact on changes in
economic activity and prices than do changes in the total amount of selling (total Q). That is because
there is nothing that’s easier to change than the supply of money and credit (total $).



For simplicity, let’s cluster the buyers in a few big categories. Buying can come from either 1) the private
sector or 2) the government sector. The private sector consists of “households” and businesses that
can be either domestic or foreign. The government sector most importantly consists of a) the Federal
Government2 which spends its money on goods and services and b) the central bank, which is the only
entity that can create money and, by and large, mostly spends its money on financial assets.

Because money and credit, and through them demand, are easier to create (or stop creating) than the production
of goods and services and investment assets, we have economic and price cycles.

The Capitalist System
As mentioned, the previously outlined economic players buy and sell both 1) goods and services and 2) financial
assets, and they can pay for them with either 1) money or 2) credit. In a capitalist system, this exchange takes
place through free choice – i.e., there are “free markets” in which buyers and sellers of goods, services and
financial assets make their transactions in pursuit of their own interests. The production and purchases of
financial assets (i.e., lending and investing) is called “capital formation”. It occurs because both the buyer and
seller of these financial assets believe that the transaction is good for them. Those with money and credit
provide it to recipients in exchange for the recipients’ “promises” to pay them more. So, for this process to work
well, there must be large numbers of capable providers of capital (i.e., investors/lenders) who choose to give
money and credit to large numbers of capable recipients of capital (borrowers and sellers of equity) in exchange
for the recipients’ believable claims that they will return amounts of money and credit that are worth more than
they were given. While the amount of money in existence is controlled by central banks, the amount of credit in
existence can be created out of thin air – i.e. any two willing parties can agree to do a transaction on credit –
though this is influenced by central bank policies. In bubbles more credit is created than can be later paid back,
which creates busts.
When capital contractions occur, economic contractions also occur, i.e. there is not enough money and/or credit
spent on goods, services and financial assets. These contractions typically occur for two reasons, which are
most commonly known as recessions (which are contractions within a short-term debt cycle) and depressions
(which are contractions within deleveragings). Recessions are typically well understood because they happen
often and most of us have experienced them, whereas depressions and deleveragings are typically poorly
understood because they happen infrequently and are not widely experienced.

Credit can be created on the spot between consenting parties. The idea of money going around via "velocity" and adding up to nominal GDP
is a misleading description of what happens.

State and local governments are of course still significant.

A short-term cycle, (which is commonly called the business cycle), arises from a) the rate of growth in
spending (i.e. total $ funded by the rates of growth in money and credit) being faster than the rate of growth in
the capacity to produce (i.e. total Q) leading to price (P) increases until b) the rate of growth in spending is
curtailed by tight money and credit, at which time a recession occurs. In other words, a recession is an
economic contraction that is due to a contraction in private sector debt growth arising from tight central bank
policy (usually to fight inflation), which ends when the central bank eases. Recessions end when central banks
lower interest rates to stimulate demand for goods and services and the credit growth that finances these
purchases, because lower interest rates 1) reduce debt service costs; 2) lower monthly payments (de-facto, the
costs) of items bought on credit, which stimulates the demand for them; and 3) raise the prices of incomeproducing assets like stocks, bonds and real estate through the present value effect of discounting their expected
cash flows at the lower interest rates, producing a “wealth effect” on spending.
In contrast:
A long-term debt cycle, arises from debts rising faster than both incomes and money until this can’t continue
because debt service costs become excessive, typically because interest rates can’t be reduced any more. A
deleveraging is the process of reducing debt burdens (i.e. debt and debt service relative to incomes).
Deleveragings typically end via a mix of 1) debt reduction,3 2) austerity, 3) redistributions of wealth, and 4) debt
monetization. A depression is the economic contraction phase of a deleveraging. It occurs because the
contraction in private sector debt cannot be rectified by the central bank lowering the cost of money. In
depressions, a) a large number of debtors have obligations to deliver more money than they have to meet their
obligations, and b) monetary policy is ineffective in reducing debt service costs and stimulating credit growth.
Typically, monetary policy is ineffective in stimulating credit growth either because interest rates can’t be
lowered (because interest rates are near 0%) to the point of favorably influencing the economics of spending
and capital formation (this produces deflationary deleveragings), or because money growth goes into the
purchase of inflation hedge assets rather than into credit growth, which produces inflationary deleveragings.
Depressions are typically ended by central banks printing money to monetize debt in amounts that offset the
deflationary depression effects of debt reductions and austerity.
To be clear, while depressions are the contraction phase of a deleveraging, deleveragings (e.g. reducing debt
burdens) can occur without depressions if they are well managed. (See our “An In-Depth Look at
Deleveragings.”)
Differences in how governments behave in recessions and deleveragings are good clues that signal which is
happening. For example, in deleveragings, central banks typically “print” money that they use to buy large
quantities of financial assets in order to compensate for the decline in private sector credit, while these actions
4
are unheard of in recessions. Also, in deleveragings, central governments typically spend much, much more to
make up for the fall in private sector spending.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Since these two types of contractions are just parts of two different types of
cycles that are explained more completely in this template, let’s look at the template.

3

Debt reductions take the form of some mix of debt writedowns (so the amount of debt to be repaid is reduced), the timing of debt
payments being extended and interest rates being reduced.

These show up in changes in their balance sheets that don’t occur in recessions.

The Template: The Three Big Forces
I believe that three main forces drive most economic activity: 1) trend line productivity growth, 2) the long-term
debt cycle and 3) the short-term debt cycle. Figuratively speaking, they look as shown below:

1.

2.

3.

What follows is an explanation of all three of these forces and how, by overlaying the archetypical “business”
cycle on top of the archetypical long-term debt cycle and overlaying them both on top of the productivity trend
line, one can derive a good template for tracking most economic/market movements. While these three forces
apply to all countries’ economies, in this study we will look at the U.S. economy over the last hundred years or so
as an example to convey the template. In “An In-Depth Look at Deleveragings” and “Why Countries Succeed
and Fail Economically” we will look at these cycles across countries.

1) Productivity Growth
As shown below in chart 1, real per capita GDP has increased at an average rate of a shade less than 2% over the
last 100 years and didn’t vary a lot from that. (For an explanation for how and why this varies by country and
over time, see the accompanying study “Why Countries Succeed and Fail Economically.”) This is because, over
time, knowledge increases, which in turn raises productivity and living standards. As shown in this chart, over
the very long run, there is relatively little variation from the trend line. Even the Great Depression in the 1930s
looks rather small. As a result, we can be relatively confident that, with time, the economy will get back on track.
However, up close, these variations from trend can be enormous. For example, typically in depressions the peakto-trough declines in real economic activity are around 20%, the destruction of financial wealth is typically more
than 50% and equity prices typically decline by around 80%. The losses in financial wealth for those who have it
at the beginning of depressions are typically greater than these numbers suggest because there is also a
tremendous shifting of who has wealth.

Swings around this trend are not primarily due to expansions and contractions in knowledge. For example, the
Great Depression didn't occur because people forgot how to efficiently produce, and it wasn't set off by war or
drought. All the elements that make the economy buzz were there, yet it stagnated. So why didn't the idle
factories simply hire the unemployed to utilize the abundant resources in order to produce prosperity? These
cycles are not due to events beyond our control, e.g., natural disasters. They are due to human nature and the
way the credit system works.
Most importantly, major swings around the trend are due to expansions and contractions in credit – i.e., credit
cycles, most importantly 1) a long-term (typically 50 to 75 years) debt cycle (i.e., the “long wave cycle”) and 2) a
shorter-term (typically 5 to 8 years) debt cycle (i.e., the “business/market cycle”).

About Debt Cycles
We find that whenever we start talking about cycles, particularly the “long-wave” variety, we raise eyebrows and
elicit reactions similar to those we’d expect if we were talking about astrology. For this reason, before we begin
explaining these two debt cycles we'd like to say a few things about cycles in general.
A cycle is nothing more than a logical sequence of events leading to a repetitious pattern. In a capitalist
economy, cycles of expansions in credit and contractions in credit drive economic cycles and they occur for
perfectly logical reasons. Each sequence is not pre-destined to repeat in exactly the same way nor to take

exactly the same amount of time, though the patterns are similar, for logical reasons. For example, if you
understand the game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand credit and economic cycles. Early in the
game of Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels. Those who
have more hotels make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible into property
in order to profit from making other players give them cash. So as the game progresses, more hotels are
acquired, which creates more need for cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with lots of
hotels on it) at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels. When they are caught
needing cash, they are forced to sell their hotels at discounted prices. So early in the game, “property is king”
and later in the game, “cash is king.” Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold the right
mix of property and cash, as this right mix changes.
Now, let’s imagine how this Monopoly® game would work if we changed the role of the bank so that it could
make loans and take deposits. Players would then be able to borrow money to buy hotels and, rather than
holding their cash idly, they would deposit it at the bank to earn interest, which would provide the bank with
more money to lend. Let’s also imagine that players in this game could buy and sell properties from each other
giving each other credit (i.e., promises to give money and at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it
would provide an almost perfect model for the way our economy operates. There would be more spending on
hotels (that would be financed with promises to deliver money at a later date). The amount owed would quickly
grow to multiples of the amount of money in existence, hotel prices would be higher, and the cash shortage for
the debtors who hold hotels would become greater down the road. So, the cycles would become more
pronounced. The bank and those who saved by depositing their money in it would also get into trouble when the
inability to come up with needed cash caused withdrawals from the bank at the same time as debtors couldn’t
come up with cash to pay the bank. Basically, economic and credit cycles work this way.
We are now going to look at how credit cycles – both long-term debt cycles and “business cycles” – drive
economic cycles.

How the System Works
Prosperity exists when the economy is operating at a high level of capacity: in other words, when demand is
pressing up against a pre-existing level of capacity. At such times, business profits are good and unemployment
is low. The longer these conditions persist, the more capacity will be increased, typically financed by credit
growth. Declining demand creates a condition of low capacity utilization; as a result, business profits are bad and
unemployment is high. The longer these conditions exist, the more cost-cutting (i.e., restructuring) will occur,
typically including debt and equity write-downs. Therefore, prosperity equals high demand, and in our creditbased economy, strong demand equals strong real credit growth; conversely, deleveraging equals low demand,
and hence lower and falling real credit growth. Contrary to now-popular thinking, recessions and depressions do
not develop because of productivity (i.e., inabilities to produce efficiently); they develop from declines in
demand, typically due to a fall-off in credit creation.
Since changes in demand precede changes in capacity in determining the direction of the economy, one would
think that prosperity would be easy to achieve simply through pursuing policies which would steadily increase
demand. When the economy is plagued by low capacity utilization, depressed business profitability and high
unemployment, why doesn't the government simply give it a good shot of whatever it takes to stimulate demand
in order to produce a far more pleasant environment of high capacity utilization, fat profits and low
unemployment? The answer has to do with what that shot consists of.

Money
Money is what you settle your payments with. Some people mistakenly believe that money is whatever will buy
you goods and services, whether that's dollar bills or simply a promise to pay (e.g., whether it's a credit card or
an account at the local grocery). When a department store gives you merchandise in return for your signature

on a credit card form, is that signature money? No, because you did not settle the transaction. Rather, you
promised to pay money. So you created credit, which is a promise to pay money.
The Federal Reserve has chosen to define “money” in terms of aggregates (i.e., currency plus various forms of
credit - M1, M2, etc.), but this is misleading. Virtually all of what they call money is credit (i.e., promises to
deliver money) rather than money itself. The total amount of debt in the U.S. is about $50 trillion and the total
amount of money (i.e., currency and reserves) in existence is about $3 trillion. So, if we were to use these
numbers as a guide, the amount of promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) is roughly 15 times the amount of
5
money there is to deliver. The main point is that most people buy things with credit and don’t pay much
attention to what they are promising to deliver and where they are going to get it from, so there is much less
money than obligations to deliver it.

Credit
As mentioned, credit is the promise to deliver money, and credit spends just like money. While credit and money
spend just as easily, when you pay with money the transaction is settled; but if you pay with credit, the payment
has yet to be made.
There are two ways demand can increase: with credit or without it. Of course, it's far easier to stimulate demand
with credit than without it. For example, in an economy in which there is no credit, if I want to buy a good or
service I would have to exchange it for a comparably valued good or service of my own. Therefore, the only way I
can increase what I own and the economy as a whole can grow is through increased production. As a result, in
an economy without credit, the growth in demand is constrained by the growth in production. This tends to
reduce the occurrence of boom-bust cycles, but it also reduces both the efficiency that leads to high prosperity
and severe deleveraging, i.e., it tends to produce lower swings around the productivity growth trend line of about
2%.
By contrast, in an economy in which credit is readily available, I can acquire goods and services without giving up
any of my own. A bank will lend the money on my pledge to repay, secured by my existing assets and future
earnings. For these reasons credit and spending can grow faster than money and income. Since that sounds
counterintuitive, let me give an example of how that can work.
If I ask you to paint my office with an agreement that I will give you the money in a few months, your painting my
office will add to your income (because you were paid with credit), so it will add to GDP, and it will add to your
net worth (because my promise to pay is considered as much of an asset as the cash that I still owe you). Our
transaction will also add an asset (i.e., the capital improvement in my office) and a liability (the debt I still owe
you) to my balance sheet. Now let’s say that buoyed by this increased amount of business that I gave you and
your improved financial condition that you want to expand. So you go to your banker who sees your increased
income and net worth, so he is delighted to lend you some “money” (increasing his sales and his balance sheet)
that you decide to buy a financial asset with (let’s say stocks) until you want to spend it. As you can see, debt,
spending and investment would have increased relative to money and income.
This process can be, and generally is, self-reinforcing because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising
net worths, which raise borrowers’ capacity to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. Typically,
monetary expansions are used to support credit expansions because more money in the system makes it easier
for debtors to pay off their loans (with money of less value), and it makes the assets I acquired worth more
because there is more money around to bid them. As a result, monetary expansions improve credit ratings and
increase collateral values, making it that much easier to borrow and buy more.
In such an economy, demand is constrained only by the willingness of creditors and debtors to extend and
receive credit. When credit is easy and cheap, borrowing and spending will occur; and when it is scarce and

characterization indicates, so it is provided solely for illustrative purposes.

expensive, borrowing and spending will be less. In the “business cycle,” the central bank will control the supply
of money and influence the amount of credit that the private sector creates by influencing the cost of credit (i.e.,
interest rates). Changes in private sector credit drive the cycle. Over the long term, typically decades, debt
burdens rise. This obviously cannot continue forever. When it can’t continue a deleveraging occurs.
As previously mentioned, the most fundamental requirement for private sector credit creation to occur in a
capitalist system is that both borrowers and lenders believe that the deal is good for them. Since one man’s debts
are another man’s assets, lenders have to believe that they will get paid back an amount of money that is greater
than inflation (i.e., more than they could get by storing their wealth in inflation hedge assets), net of taxes. And,
because debtors have to pledge their assets (i.e., equity) as collateral in order to motivate the lenders, they have
to be at least as confident in their abilities to pay their debts as they value the assets (i.e., equity) that they
pledged as collateral.
Also, an important consideration of investors is liquidity – i.e., the ability to sell their investments for money and
use that money to buy goods and services. For example, if I own a $100,000 Treasury bond, I probably presume
that I'll be able to exchange it for $100,000 in cash and in turn exchange the cash for $100,000 worth of goods
and services. However, since the ratio of financial assets to money is so high, obviously if a large number of
people tried to convert their financial assets into money and buy goods and services at the same time, the central
bank would have to either produce a lot more money (risking a monetary inflation) and/or allow a lot of defaults
(causing a deflationary deleveraging).

Monetary Systems
One of the greatest powers governments have is the creation of money and credit, which they exert by
determining their countries’ monetary systems and by controlling the levers that increase and decrease the
supply of money and credit. The monetary systems chosen have varied over time and between countries. In the
old days there was barter - i.e., the exchange of items of equal intrinsic value. That was the basis of money.
When you paid with gold coins, the exchange was for items of equal intrinsic value. Then credit developed – i.e.,
promises to deliver “money” of intrinsic value. Then there were promises to deliver money that didn’t have
intrinsic value.
Those who lend expect that they will get back an amount of money that can be converted into goods or services
of a somewhat greater purchasing power than the money they originally lent – i.e., they use credit to exchange
goods and services today for comparably valuable goods and services in the future. Since credit began, creditors
essentially asked those who controlled the monetary systems: “How do we know you won’t just print a lot of
money that won’t buy me much when I go to exchange it for goods and services in the future?” At different
times, this question was answered differently.
Basically, there are two types of monetary systems: 1) commodity-based systems – those systems consisting of
some commodity (usually gold), currency (which can be converted into the commodity at a fixed price) and
credit (a claim on the currency); and 2) fiat systems – those systems consisting of just currency and credit. In
the first system, it's more difficult to create credit expansions. That is because the public will offset the
government's attempts to increase currency and credit by giving both back to the government in return for the
commodity they are exchangeable for. As the supply of money increases, its value falls; or looked at the other
way, the value of the commodity it is convertible into rises. When it rises above the fixed price, it is profitable for
those holding credit (i.e., claims on the currency) to sell their debt for currency in order to buy the tangible asset
from the government at below the market price. The selling of the credit and the taking of currency out of
circulation cause credit to tighten and the value of the money to rise; on the other hand, the general price level of
goods and services will fall. Its effect will be lower inflation and lower economic activity.
Since the value of money has fallen over time relative to the value of just about everything else, we could tie the
currency to just about anything in order to show how this monetary system would have worked. For example,
since a one-pound loaf of white bread in 1946 cost ten cents, let's imagine we tied the dollar to bread. In other

words, let’s imagine a monetary system in which the government in 1946 committed to buy bread at 10 cents a
pound and stuck to that until now. Today a pound loaf of white bread costs $2.75. Of course, if they had used
this monetary system, the price couldn’t have risen to $2.75 because we all would have bought our bread from
the government at ten cents instead of from the free market until the government ran out of bread. But, for our
example, let’s say that the price of bread is $2.75. I'd certainly be willing to take all of my money, buy bread from
the government at 10 cents and sell it in the market at $2.75, and others would do the same. This process would
reduce the amount of money in circulation, which would then reduce the prices of all goods and services, and it
would increase the amount of bread in circulation (thus lowering its price more rapidly than other prices). In
fact, if the supply and demand for bread were not greatly influenced by its convertibility to currency, this tie
would have dramatically slowed the last 50 years’ rapid growth in currency and credit.
Obviously, what the currency is convertible into has an enormous impact on this process. For example, if instead
of tying the dollar to bread, we chose to tie it to eggs, since the price of a dozen eggs in 1947 was seventy cents
and today it is about $2.00, currency and credit growth would have been less restricted.
Ideally, if one has a commodity-based currency system, one wants to tie the currency to something that is not
subject to great swings in supply or demand. For example, if the currency were tied to bread, bakeries would in
effect have the power to produce money, leading to increased inflation. Gold and, to a much lesser extent, silver
have historically proven more stable than most other currency backings, although they are by no means perfect.
In the second type of monetary system – i.e., in a fiat system in which the amount of money is not constrained by
the ability to exchange it for a commodity – the growth of money and credit is very much subject to the influence
of the central bank and the willingness of borrowers and lenders to create credit.
Governments typically prefer fiat systems because they offer more power to print money, expand credit and
redistribute wealth by changing the value of money. Human nature being what it is, those in government (and
those not) tend to value immediate gratification over longer-term benefits, so government policies tend to
increase demand by allowing liberal credit creation, which leads to debt crises. Governments typically choose
commodity-based systems only when they are forced to in reaction to the value of money having been severely
depreciated due to the government’s “printing” of a lot of it to relieve the excessive debt burdens that their
unconstrained monetary systems allowed. They abandon commodity-based monetary systems when the
constraints to money creation become too onerous in debt crises. So throughout history, governments have
gone back and forth between commodity-based and fiat monetary systems in reaction to the painful
consequences of each. However, they don’t make these changes often, as monetary systems typically work well
for many years, often decades, with central banks varying interest rates and money supplies to control credit

In the next two sections we first describe the long-term debt cycle and then the business/market cycle.

2) The Long-Term (i.e., Long Wave) Cycle
As previously mentioned, when debts and spending rise faster than money and income, the process is selfreinforcing on the upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise
borrowers’ capacity to borrow which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can’t rise
faster than money and income forever there are limits to debt growth. Think of debt growth that is faster than
income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle – there is a limited amount of it that you can use to get an extra
boost, but you can’t live on it forever. In the case of debt, you can take it out before you put it in (i.e., if you don’t
have any debt, you can take it out), but you are expected to return what you took out. When you are taking it
out, you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the appearance of being prosperous. At such
times, you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as being creditworthy and not pay enough
attention to what paying back will look like. When debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time
of paying back comes, the process works in reverse. It is that dynamic that creates long-term debt cycles. These

long-term debt cycles have existed for as long as there has been credit. Even the Old Testament described the
need to wipe out debt once every 50 years, which was called the year of Jubilee.

Upswings in the cycle occur, and are self-reinforcing, in a process by which money growth creates greater debt
growth, which finances spending growth and asset purchases. Spending growth and higher asset prices allow
even more debt growth. This is because lenders determine how much they can lend on the basis of the
borrowers’ 1) income/cash flows to service the debt and 2) net worth/collateral, as well as their own capacities
to lend, and these rise in a self-reinforcing manner.
Suppose you earn $100,000, have a net worth of $100,000 and have no debt. You have the capacity to borrow
$10,000/year, so you could spend $110,000 per year for a number of years, even though you only earn
$100,000. For an economy as a whole, this increased spending leads to higher earnings, that supports stock
valuations and other asset values, giving people higher incomes and more collateral to borrow more against, and
so on. In the up-wave part of the cycle, promises to deliver money (i.e., debt burdens) rise relative to both a) the
supply of money and b) the amount of money and credit debtors have coming in (via incomes, borrowings and
sales of assets). This up-wave in the cycle typically goes on for decades, with variations in it primarily due to
central banks tightening and easing credit (which makes business cycles). But it can’t go on forever. Eventually
the debt service payments become equal to or larger than the amount we can borrow and the spending must
decline. When promises to deliver money (debt) can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in,
the process works in reverse and we have deleveragings. Since borrowing is simply a way of pulling spending
forward, the person spending $110,000 per year and earning $100,000 per year has to cut his spending to
$90,000 for as many years as he spent $110,000, all else being equal.
While the last chart showed the amount of debt relative to GDP, the debt ratio, it is more precise to say that high
debt service payments (i.e., principal and interest combined), rather than high debt levels, cause debt squeezes
because cash flows rather than levels of debt create the squeezes that slow the economy. For example, if
interest rates fall enough, debts can increase without debt service payments rising enough to cause a squeeze.
This dynamic is best conveyed in the chart below. It shows interest payments, principal payments and total debt
service payments of American households as a percentage of their disposable incomes going back to 1920. We
are showing this debt service burden for the household sector because the household sector is the most
important part of the economy; however, the concept applies equally well to all sectors and all individuals. As
shown, the debt service burden of households has increased to the highest level since the Great Depression.

The long-term debt cycle top occurs when 1) debt burdens are high and/or 2) monetary policy doesn’t
produce credit growth. From that point on, debt can’t rise relative to incomes, net worth and money supply.
That is when deleveraging – i.e. bringing down these debt ratios – begins. All deleveragings start because there is
a shortage of money relative to debtors’ needs for it. This leads to large numbers of businesses, households and
financial institutions defaulting on their debts and cutting costs, which leads to higher unemployment and other
problems. While these debt problems can occur for many reasons, most classically they occur because
investment assets are bought at high prices and with leverage6 – i.e., because debt levels are set on the basis of
overly optimistic assumptions about future cash flows. As a result of this, actual cash flows fall short of what’s
required for debtors to service their debts. Ironically, quite often in the early stages the cash flows fall short
because of tight monetary policies that are overdue attempts to curtail these bubble activities (buying overpriced
assets with excessive leverage), so that the tight money triggers them (e.g., in 1928/29 in much of the world, in
1989/91 in Japan and in 2006/07 in much of the world). Also ironically, inflation in financial assets is more
dangerous than inflation in goods and services because this financial asset inflation appears like a good thing and
isn’t prevented even though it is as dangerous as any other form of over-indebtedness. In fact, while debt
financed financial booms that are accompanied by low inflation are typically precursors of busts, at the time they
typically appear to be investment generated productivity booms (e.g. much of the world in the late 1920s, Japan
in the late 1980s and much of the world in the mid 2000s).
Typically, though not always, interest rates decline in reaction to the economic and market declines and central
banks easing, but they can’t decline enough because they hit 0%. As a result, the abilities of central banks to
alleviate these debt burdens, to stimulate private credit growth and to cause asset prices to rise via lower interest
rates are lost. These conditions cause buyers of financial assets to doubt that the value of the money they will
get from owning this asset will be more than the value of the money they pay for it. Then monetary policy is
ineffective in rectifying the imbalance.
In deleveragings, rather than indebtedness increasing (i.e. debt and debt service rising relative to income and
money), it decreases. This can happen in one of four ways: 1) debt reduction, 2) austerity, 3) transferring wealth
from the haves to the have-nots and 4) debt monetization. Each one of these four paths reduces debt/income
ratios, but they have different effects on inflation and growth. Debt reduction (i.e., defaults and restructurings)
and austerity are both deflationary and depressing while debt monetization is inflationary and stimulative.

This time around, residential and commercial real estate, private equity, lower grade credits and, to a lesser extent, listed equities were the
assets that were bought at high prices and on lots of leverage. In both the U.S. Great Depression and in the Japanese deleveraging, stocks
and real estate were also the assets of choice that were bought at high prices and on leverage.

Transfers of wealth typically occur in many forms, but rarely in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the
deleveraging. The differences between how deleveragings play out depends on the amounts and paces of these
four measures.
Depressions are the contraction phase of the deleveraging process. Typically the “depression” phase of the
deleveraging process comes at the first part of the deleveraging process, when defaults and austerity (i.e. the
forces of deflation and depression) dominate. Initially, in the depression phase of the deleveraging process, the
money coming in to debtors via incomes and borrowings is not enough to meet debtors’ obligations, assets need
to be sold and spending needs to be cut in order to raise cash. This leads asset values to fall, which reduces the
value of collateral, and in turn reduces incomes. Because of both lower collateral values and lower incomes,
borrowers’ creditworthiness is reduced, so they justifiably get less credit, and so it continues in a self-reinforcing
manner. Since the creditworthiness of borrowers is judged by both a) the values of their assets/collaterals (i.e.,
their net worths) in relation to their debts and b) the sizes of their incomes relative to the size of their debt
service payments, and since both net worths and incomes fall faster than debts, borrowers become less
creditworthy and lenders become more reluctant to lend. In this phase of the cycle the contraction is selfreinforcing at the same time as debt/income and debt/net-worth ratios rise. That occurs for two reasons. First,
when debts cannot be serviced both debtors and creditors are hurt; since one man’s debts are another man’s
assets, debt problems reduce net worths and borrowing abilities, thus causing a self-reinforcing contraction
cycle. Second, when spending is curtailed incomes are also reduced, thus reducing the ability to spend, also
causing a self-reinforcing contraction.
You can see debt burdens rise at the same time as the economy is in a deflationary depression in both chart 2
and chart 3 above. The vertical line on these charts is at 1929. As you can see in chart 2, the debt/GDP ratio shot
up from about 160% to about 250% from 1929 to 1933. The vertical line in chart 3 shows the same picture – i.e.,
debt service levels rose relative to income levels because income levels fell. In the economic and credit
downturn, debt burdens increase at the same time as debts are being written down, so the debt liquidation
process is reinforced. Chart 4 shows the household sector’s debt relative to its net worth. As shown, this
leverage ratio shot up from already high levels, as it did during the Great Depression, due to declines in net
worths arising from falling housing and stock prices.

As mentioned earlier, in a credit-based economy, the ability to spend is an extension of the ability to borrow. For
lending/borrowing to occur, lenders have to believe that a) they will get paid back an amount of money that is
greater than inflation and b) they will be able to convert their debt into money. In deleveragings, lenders
justifiably worry that these things will not happen.

Unlike in recessions, when cutting interest rates and creating more money can rectify this imbalance, in
deleveragings monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit. In other words, in recessions (when monetary
policy is effective) the imbalance between the amount of money and the need for it to service debt can be
rectified by cutting interest rates enough to 1) ease debt service burdens, 2) stimulate economic activity because
monthly debt service payments are high relative to incomes and 3) produce a positive wealth effect; however, in
deleveragings, this can’t happen. In deflationary depressions/deleveragings, monetary policy is typically
ineffective in creating credit because interest rates hit 0% and can’t be lowered further, so other, less effective
ways of increasing money are followed. Credit growth is difficult to stimulate because borrowers remain overindebted, making sensible lending impossible. In inflationary deleveragings, monetary policy is ineffective in
creating credit because increased money growth goes into other currencies and inflation hedge assets because
investors fear that their lending will be paid back with money of depreciated value.
In order to try to alleviate this fundamental imbalance, governments inevitably a) create initiatives to encourage
credit creation, b) ease the rules that require debtors to come up with money to service their debts (i.e., create
forbearance) and, most importantly, c) print and spend money to buy goods, services and financial assets. The
printing of and buying financial assets by central banks shows up in central banks’ balance sheets expanding and
the increased spending by central governments shows up in budget deficits exploding. This is shown in the
following three charts.

You can tell deleveragings from these three things occurring together, which does not happen at other times.
Typically, though not necessarily, these moves come in progressively larger dosages as initial dosages of these
sorts fail to rectify the imbalance and reverse the deleveraging process; however, these dosages do typically
cause temporary periods of relief that are manifest in bear market rallies in financial assets and increased
economic activity. For example in the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market (of between
21% and 48%) in a bear market that totaled 89%, with all of these rallies triggered by these sorts of increasingly
strong dosages of government actions which were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance. That is
because a return to an environment of normal capital formation and normal economic activity can occur only by
eliminating this fundamental imbalance so that capable providers of capital (i.e., investors/lenders) willingly
choose to give money to capable recipients of capital (borrowers and sellers of equity) in exchange for believable
claims that they will get back an amount of money that is worth more than they gave. Eventually there is enough
“printing of money” or debt monetization to negate the deflationary forces of both debt reduction and austerity.
When a good balance of debt reduction, austerity, and “printing/monetizing” occurs, debt burdens can fall
relative to incomes with positive economic growth. In the U.S. deleveraging of the 1930s, this occurred in 193337.

Some people mistakenly think that the depression problem is just psychological: that scared investors move their
money from riskier investments to safer ones (e.g., from stocks and high yield lending to government cash), and
that problems can be rectified by coaxing them to move their money back into riskier investments. This is wrong
for two reasons. First, contrary to popular thinking, the deleveraging dynamic is not primarily psychologically
driven. It is primarily driven by the supply and demand of and relationships between credit, money and goods
and services. If everyone went to sleep and woke up with no memories of what had happened, we would all soon
find ourselves in the same position. That is, because debtors still couldn’t service their debts, because their
obligations to deliver money would still be too large relative to the money they are taking in, the government
would still be faced with the same choices that would still have the same consequences, etc. Related to this, if
the central bank produces more money to alleviate the shortage, it will cheapen the value of money, thus not
rectifying creditors’ worries about being paid back an amount of money that is worth more than they gave.
Second, it is not correct that the amount of money in existence remains the same and has simply moved from
riskier assets to less risky ones. Most of what people think is money is really credit, and it does disappear. For
example, when you buy something in a store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, “I promise to pay.”
Together you created a credit asset and a credit liability. So where did you take the money from? Nowhere. You
created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store owner justifiably believes that you and others
might not pay the credit card company and that the credit card company might not pay him if that happens. Then
he correctly believes that the “asset” he has isn’t really there. It didn’t go somewhere else.
As implied by this, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought
was their wealth isn’t really there. When investors try to convert their investments into money in order to raise
needed cash, the liquidity of their investments is tested and, in cases in which the investments prove illiquid,
panic-induced “runs” and sell-offs of their securities occur. Naturally those who experience runs, especially
banks (though this is true of most entities that rely on short-term funding), have problems raising money and
credit to meet their needs, so they often fail. At such times, governments are forced to decide which ones to
save by providing them with money and whether to get this money through the central government (i.e., through
the budget process) or through the central bank “printing” more money. Governments inevitably do both,
though in varying degrees. What determines whether deleveragings are deflationary or inflationary is the extent
to which central banks create money to negate the effects of contracting credit.
Governments with commodity-based monetary systems or pegged currencies are more limited in their abilities
to “print” and provide money, while those with independent fiat monetary systems are less constrained.
However, in both cases, the central bank is eager to provide money and credit, so it always lowers the quality of
the collateral it accepts and, in addition to providing money to some essential banks, it also typically provides
money to some non-bank entities it considers essential.
The central bank’s easing of monetary policy and the movement of investor money to safer investments, initially
drives down short-term government interest rates, steepens the yield curve and widens credit and liquidity
premiums. Those who do not receive money and/or credit that is needed to meet their debt service obligations
and maintain their operations, which is typically a large segment of debtors, default and fail.
In depressions, as credit collapses, workers lose jobs and many of them, having inadequate savings, need
financial support. So in addition to needing money to provide financial support to the system, governments need
money to help those in greatest financial need. Additionally, to the extent that they want to increase spending to
make up for decreased private sector spending, they need more money. At the same time, their tax revenue falls
because incomes fall. For these reasons, governments’ budget deficits increase. Inevitably, the amount of money
lent to governments at these times increases less than their needs (i.e., they have problems funding their
deficits), despite the increased desire of lenders to buy government securities to seek safety at these times. As a
result, central banks are again forced to choose between “printing” more money to buy their governments’ debts
or allowing their governments and their private sector to compete for the limited supply of money, thus allowing
extremely tight money conditions.

Governments with commodity-based money systems are forced to have smaller budget deficits and tighter
monetary policies than governments with fiat monetary systems, though they all eventually relent and print more
money (i.e., those on commodity-based monetary systems either abandon these systems or change the
amount/pricing of the commodity that they will exchange for a unit of money so that they print more, and those
on fiat systems will just print more). This “printing” of money takes the form of central bank purchases of
government securities and non-government assets such as corporate securities, equities and other assets. In
other words, the government “prints” money and uses it to negate some of the effects of contracting credit. This
is reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity
contract, so the money multiplier and the velocity of money typically initially contract. If the money creation is
large enough, it devalues the currency, lowers real interest rates and drives investors from financial assets to
inflation hedge assets. This typically happens when investors want to move money outside the currency, and
short-term government debt is no longer considered a safe investment.
Because governments need more money, and since wealth and incomes are typically heavily concentrated in the
hands of a small percentage of the population, governments raise taxes on the wealthy. Also, in deleveragings,
those who earned their money in the booms, especially the capitalists who made a lot of money working in the
financial sector helping to create the debt (and especially the short sellers who some believe profited at others’
expense), are resented. Tensions between the “haves” and the “have-nots” typically increase and, quite often,
there is a move from the right to the left. In fact, there is a saying that essentially says “in booms everyone is a
capitalist and in busts everyone is a socialist.” For these various reasons, taxes on the wealthy are typically
significantly raised. These increased taxes typically take the form of greater income and consumption taxes
because these forms of taxation are the most effective in raising revenues. While sometimes wealth and
7
inheritance taxes are also increased, these typically raise very little money because much wealth is illiquid and,
even for liquid assets, forcing the taxpayer to sell financial assets to make their tax payments undermines capital
formation. Despite these greater taxes on the wealthy, increases in tax revenue are inadequate because incomes
– both earned incomes and incomes from capital – are so depressed, and expenditures on consumption are
reduced.
The wealthy experience a tremendous loss of “real” wealth in all forms – i.e., from their portfolios declining in
value, from their earned incomes declining and from higher rates of taxation, in inflation- adjusted terms. As a
result, they become extremely defensive. Quite often, they are motivated to move their money out of the
country (which contributes to currency weakness), illegally dodge taxes and seek safety in liquid, non-creditdependent investments.
Workers losing jobs and governments wanting to protect them become more protectionist and favor weaker
currency policies. Protectionism slows economic activity, and currency weakness fosters capital flight. Debtor
countries typically suffer most from capital flight.
When money leaves the country, central banks are once again put in the position of having to choose between
“printing” more money, which lessens its value, and not printing money in order to maintain its value but allowing
money to tighten. They inevitably choose to “print” more money. This is additionally bearish for the currency.
As mentioned, currency declines are typically acceptable to governments because a weaker currency is
stimulative for growth and helps to negate deflationary pressures. Additionally, when deflation is a problem,
currency devaluations are desirable because they help to negate it.
Debtor, current account deficit countries are especially vulnerable to capital withdrawals and currency weakness
as foreign investors also tend to flee due to both currency weakness and an environment inhospitable to good
returns on capital. However, this is less true for countries that have a great amount of debt denominated in their
own currencies (like the United States in the recent period and in the Great Depression) as these debts create a
demand for these currencies. Since debt is a promise to deliver money that one doesn’t have, this is essentially a
short squeeze which ends when a) the shorts are fully squeezed (i.e., the debts are defaulted on) and/or b)
7

The extent to which wealth taxes can be applied varies by country. For example, they have been judged to be unconstitutional in the U.S.
but have been allowed in other countries.

16

enough money is created to alleviate the squeeze, and/or c) the debt service requirements are reduced in some
other way (e.g., forbearance).
The risk at this stage of the process is that the currency weakness and the increased supply of money will lead to
short-term credit (even government short-term credit) becoming undesirable, causing the buying of inflation
hedge assets and capital flight rather than credit creation. For foreign investors, receiving an interest rate that is
near 0% and having the foreign currency that their deposits are denominated in decline produces a negative
return; so this set of circumstances makes holding credit, even government short-term credit, undesirable.
Similarly, for domestic investors, this set of circumstances makes foreign currency deposits more desirable. If
and when this happens, investors accelerate their selling of financial assets, especially debt assets, to get cash in
order to use this cash to buy other currencies or inflation hedge assets such as gold. They also seek to borrow
cash in that local currency. Once again, that puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between
increasing the supply of money to accommodate this demand for it or allowing money and credit to tighten and
real interest rates to rise. At such times, sometimes governments seek to curtail this movement by establishing
foreign exchange controls and/or prohibiting gold ownership. Also, sometimes price and wage controls are put
into place. Such moves typically create economic distortions rather than alleviate problems.
Though the deleveraging process, especially the depression phase of it, seems horrible and certainly produces
great hardships – in some cases, even wars – it is the free market’s way of repairing itself. In other words, it gets
the capital markets and the economy into a much healthier condition by rectifying the fundamental imbalance.
Debts are reduced (through bankruptcies and other forms of debt restructuring), businesses’ break-even levels
are reduced through cost-cutting, the pricing of financial assets becomes cheap, and the supply of money to buy
the assets and to service debts is increased by the central banks – so capital formation becomes viable again.
Deleveragings typically end via a mix of 1) debt reduction, 2) austerity, 3) redistributions of wealth, and 4) debt
monetization. Additionally, through this process, businesses lowering their break-even levels through costcutting, substantial increases in risk and liquidity premiums that restore the economics of capital formation (i.e.,
lending and equity investing), and nominal interest rates being held under nominal growth rates typically occur.
The decline in economic and credit creation activity (the depression phase) is typically fast, lasting two to three
years. However, the subsequent recovery in economic activity and capital formation tends to be slow, so it takes
roughly a decade (hence the term “lost decade”) for real economic activity to reach its former peak level.
Though it takes about a decade to return the economy to its former peak levels, it typically takes longer for real
stock prices to reach former highs, because equity risk premiums take a very long time to reach pre-deleveraging
lows. During this time nominal interest rates must be kept below nominal growth rates to reduce the debt
burdens. If interest rates are at 0% and there is deflation, central banks must “print” enough money to raise
nominal growth.
As mentioned, these cycles are due to human nature and the way the system works. Throughout this process,
most everyone behaves pretty much as you’d expect in pursuing their self-interest, thus reacting to and causing
developments in logical ways, given how the economic machine works.

3) The Short-Term Debt Cycle
The short-term debt cycle, also known as the business cycle, is primarily controlled by central banks’ policies
that a) tighten when inflation is too high and/or rising uncomfortably because there isn’t much slack in the
economy (as reflected in the GDP gap, capacity utilization and the unemployment rate) and credit growth is
strong; and b) ease when the reverse conditions exist. The cycles in the U.S. since 1960 are shown below.

These cycles can be described a bit differently by different people, but they are all about the same. They
typically occur in six phases – four in the expansion and two in the recession.
The expansion phase of the cycle:
The “early-cycle” (which typically lasts about five or six quarters), typically begins with the demand for
interest rate sensitive items (e.g., housing and cars) and retail sales picking up because of low interest rates
and lots of available credit. It is also supported by prior inventory liquidations stopping and inventory
rebuilding starting. This increased demand and rising production pulls the average workweek and then
employment up. Credit growth is typically fast, economic growth is strong (i.e., in excess of 4%), inflation is
low, growth in consumption is strong, the rate of inventory accumulation is increasing, the U.S. stock market
is typically the best investment (because there is fast growth and interest rates aren’t rising because
inflation isn’t rising) and inflation hedge assets and commodities are the worst-performing assets.
This is typically followed by what I call the “mid-cycle” (which lasts an average of three or four quarters)
when economic growth slows substantially (i.e., to around 2%), inflation remains low, growth in
consumption slows, the rate of inventory accumulation declines, interest rates dip, the stock market rate of
increase tapers off, and the rate of decline in inflation hedge assets slows.
This in turn is followed by the “late-cycle” (which typically begins about 2 ½ years into expansion, depending
on how much slack existed in the economy at the last recession’s trough). At this point, economic growth
picks up to a moderate pace (i.e., around 3.5-4%), capacity constraints emerge, but credit and demand
growth are still strong. So, inflation begins to trend higher, growth in consumption rises, inventories typically
pick up, interest rates rise, the stock market stages its last advance and inflation hedge assets become the
best-performing investments.
This is typically followed by the tightening phase of the expansion. In this phase actual or anticipated
acceleration of inflation prompts the Fed to turn restrictive, which shows up in reduced liquidity, interest
rates rising and the yield curve flattening or inverting. This in turn causes money supply and credit growth to
fall and the stock market to decline before the economy turns down.
The recession phase of the cycle follows and occurs in two parts.

In the early part of the recession, the economy contracts, slack returns (as measured by the GDP gap,
capacity utilization and the unemployment rate), stocks, commodities and inflation hedge assets fall and
inflation declines because the Fed remains tight.
In the late part of the recession, the central bank eases monetary policy as inflation concerns subside and
recession concerns grow. So interest rates decline and the lower interest rates cause stock prices to rise
(even though the economy hasn’t yet turned up) while commodity prices and inflation hedge assets
continue to be weak. The lower interest rates and higher stock prices set the stage for the expansion part of
the cycle to begin.
Although I have referred to average time lags between each of these stages of the cycle, as mentioned from the
outset, it is the sequence of events, not the specific timeline, which is important to keep an eye on. For example,
given the previously described linkages, inflation doesn't normally heat up until the slack in the economy is
largely eliminated, and the Fed doesn't normally turn restrictive until inflation rises. An expansion that starts off
after a deep recession (i.e., one that produces lots of slack) is bound to last longer than an expansion that begins
with less excess capacity. Similarly, as the cycle progresses through its various stages as a function of the
sequences just described, the rate at which it progresses will be a function of the forcefulness of the influences
which drive its progression. For example, an expansion that is accompanied by an aggressively stimulative
central bank is likely to be stronger and evolve more quickly than one that is accompanied by a less stimulative
monetary policy. Also, exogenous influences such as China’s entry into the world economy, wars and natural
disasters can alter the progressions of these cycles. What I am providing is a description of the classic template:
not all are manifest precisely as described.
For sake of brevity, we won’t go into great depth about business cycles here.

The Interaction of These Three Forces
While the economy is more complicated than this template suggests, laying the business cycle on top of the
“long wave” cycle and then laying them both on top of the trend per capita GDP growth line gives a reasonably
good roadmap for understanding the capitalist system and seeing both where we are now and where we are
probably headed. For the sake of brevity, we won’t digress into a complete explanation of this. But we will give
an example.
Example: The table below shows each of the cyclical peaks and troughs in the fed funds rate, when they
occurred, the magnitudes of changes up and the magnitudes of the changes down (in both basis point terms and
percentage terms), since 1919. These are the interest rate changes that caused all of the recessions and
expansions over the last 90 years. This table shows 15 cyclical increases and 15 cyclical decreases. Note that
these swings were around one big uptrend and one big downtrend. Specifically, note that from the September
1932 low (at 0%) until the May 1981 high (at 19%), every cyclical low in interest rates was above the prior
cyclical low and every cyclical high was above the prior cyclical high – i.e., all of the cyclical increases and
decreases were around that 50-year uptrend. And note that from the May 1981 high in the fed funds rate (at
19%), until the March 2009 low in the fed funds rate (0%), every cyclical low in the fed funds rate was lower
than the prior low and every cyclical high in interest rates was below the prior cyclical high – i.e., all of the cyclical
increases and all of the cyclical decreases were around a 27-year down trend. Each cyclical decline in interest
rates incrementally reduced debt service payments, lowered the de-facto purchase prices of items bought on
credit to make them more affordable and boosted the value of assets a notch (having a positive wealth effect).
So, debt continued to rise relative to income and money, though the trend in debt service payments was
essentially flat, until interest rates hit 0% and this could not longer continue, at which time the government had
to print and spend a lot of money to make up for the reduced private sector credit creation and spending.

Again, for sake of brevity, we won’t go into greater depth about the three forces' interactions here. As mentioned
at the outset, I wrote this paper just to give you my simple-minded explanation of how I believe the economic
machine works at a fundamental level so that you can assess it for yourself. However, those who are inclined to
learn more about how the deleveraging process and long term cycles work should refer to my papers: “An InDepth Look at Deleveragings” and “Why Countries Succeed and Fail Economically”.

### 《how-countries-go-broke》

---

Introduction
Are there limits to a country’s’ debt and debt growth?
What will happen to interest rates and all that they affect if government debt growth isn’t slowed?
Can a big, important country that has a major reserve currency like the US go broke—and, if so, what would that
look like?
Is there such a thing as a “Big Debt Cycle” that we can track that will tell us when to worry about debt and what
to do about it?
These aren’t just academic questions for academic economists. They are questions that investors, policy makers,
and most everyone must answer because the answers will have huge effects on all our well-beings and what we
should do. But definitive answers don’t currently exist.
At this time, some people believe that there isn't any limit to government debt and debt growth, especially if a
country has a reserve currency. That’s because they believe that the central bank of a reserve currency country that
has its money widely accepted around the world can always print the money to service its debts. Others believe that
the high levels of debt and rapid debt growth are harbingers of a big debt crisis on the horizon, but they do not know
exactly how and when the crisis will come—or what its impacts will be.
And what about the big, long-term debt cycle? While the “business cycle” is widely acknowledged and some people
recognize that it is driven by a short-term debt cycle, that is not true for the big, long-term debt cycle. Nobody
acknowledges it or talks about it. I couldn’t find any good studies or descriptions of it in textbooks, and even the
world’s leading economists—including those who are now running, or in the past ran, central banks and government
Treasuries—didn’t have much to say about this critically important subject when I explored it with them. That is why
I did this study and am passing it along.
Before I get into all that, I should begin by explaining where I’m coming from. I don’t come to this subject as an
economist. I come as a global macro investor who for over 50 years has been through many debt cycles in many
countries and has had to navigate and understand them well enough to bet on how they would go. I have carefully
studied all the big debt cycles over the last 100 years, and superficially studied many more from the past 500
years, so I believe that I understand how to navigate them. Because I am now deeply concerned, I feel a
responsibility to pass along this study for others to assess for themselves.
To gain my understanding, I look at many cases like a doctor studies many cases, examining the mechanics behind
them to understand the cause/effect relationships that drive their progressions. I also learn from being in these
experiences, reflecting on what I learn, writing it up, and having smart people read and challenge it. Then I build
systems to place my bets on what I learned and have new experiences. I do that over and over and will do it until I
die because I love it. Because my game has been to bet on the markets and because the debt markets drive just
about everything, I have been obsessed with studying debt dynamics for decades. I believe that if you understand
these dynamics, you can do very well as an investor, businessperson, or policy maker, and if you don’t, you ultimately
will be hurt by them.
Through my research, I discovered that there are big, long-term debt cycles that have unfailingly led to big debt
bubbles and busts. I saw that only about 20% of the roughly 750 currency/debt markets that have existed since
1700 remain and that all these remaining ones have been severely devalued through the mechanistic process I am
going to describe in this study. I saw how this big, long-term debt cycle was described in the Old Testament, how
it repeatedly played out in Chinese dynasties over thousands of years, and how time and again it has
foreshadowed the fall of empires, countries, and provinces.
These Big Debt Cycles have always worked in timeless and universally consistent ways that are not well
understood but should be. In this study, I hope to explain how they work with such clarity that my description will

serve as a template that can be used to see what is going on with, and what is likely to happen to, money and
debt. While I recognize that the Big Debt Cycle template I will describe has not previously been vetted, I am
confident it exists because I have made a lot of money using it to bet on how things would go. I am passing it along
because I am now at a stage of life in which I want to share what I have learned that I have found of value. You
can do what you like with it.
Why do I think I understand something that others don’t? I theorize that this is for a few reasons. First, this dynamic
is not widely understood because big, long-term debt cycles typically last about one lifetime—roughly 80 years (give
or take 25 years)—so we don’t get to learn about them through experience. Second, because we focus so much on
what is happening to us at the time it is happening, people overlook the big picture. I also think there are biases
against being concerned about too much debt because most people like the spending ability that credit gives them,
and it is also true that there have been many warnings about pending debt crises that never happened. Memories
of big debt crises like the 2008 global financial crisis and the European debt crisis of the PIIGS countries (Portugal,
Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) have faded, and since we have gotten past them, many people assume that policy
makers learned how to manage them rather than view these cases as early warnings of bigger crises on the horizon.
But whatever the reason, it doesn’t matter exactly why these dynamics are overlooked. I am going to paint a picture
of what happens and why, and if there is enough interest in what I’m saying, my template will be assessed and will
live or die on its merits.
That leads me to a principle:
•

If we don’t agree on how things work, we won’t be able to agree on what’s happening or what is likely
to happen. For that reason, I need to lay out my picture of how the machine works and try to triangulate
with you and other knowledgeable people about it before moving on to look at what’s happening and what
might happen.

At a time when government debt is large and increasing rapidly, it seems to me dangerously negligent to assume
that this time will be different from other times without first studying how other cases transpired. It would be like
assuming that we will never have a civil war or world war again because they haven’t happened before in our
lifetimes without studying the mechanics that brought them about in the past. (By the way, I believe that both the
civil war and world war dynamics are also going on today.) As in my other books, 1 I will create a description of the
archetypical dynamic and then look at how and why different cases transpired differently so that one can track
current cases relative to the template and put into context what’s happening and what’s likely to happen. In that
way, you will both see many cases of this happening and get a peek into the future. Comparing what is happening
with that template leads me to believe that we are heading into one of those cases in which central governments
and central banks will “go broke” in the ways that have happened hundreds of times before and have had big political
and geopolitical consequences.
This brings me to an important point. The Big Debt Cycle is just one of several interrelated forces that together
make up what I call the overall Big Cycle. For example, 1) Big Debt Cycles influence and are affected by largely
coinciding 2) big cycles of political and social harmony and conflict within countries that are both affected by and
affect 3) big cycles of geopolitical harmony and conflict between countries. These cycles in turn are affected by
both 4) big acts of nature, like droughts, floods, and pandemics and 5) developments of big new technologies.
Combined, these five forces make up the overall Big Cycle of peace and prosperity and conflict and depression.
Because these forces affect each other and practically everything, they must be thought of together. How these
1 While debt and currency cycles are comprehensively covered in my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises (which looked at all of the 48

biggest debt crises in the 100 years between 1918 and 2018, the year I published the book) and in Chapters 3 and 4 of my book Principles for
Dealing with the Changing World Order (which looked at the rises and declines of the world’s reserve currency markets over the last 500 years
and 750 currencies since 1700), in this study, I am going to get much more granular in explaining the last and most dramatic breakdown part of
the cycle that leads to changes in currency orders.

forces have worked and interacted and are working and interacting now is covered in much greater detail in my
book and video titled Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and to a lesser extent in Chapter 17 of
this study, which is the concluding chapter. In this study, I will be mostly focusing on the Big Debt Cycle, though we
will see many references to the ways in which the Big Debt Cycle interacts with the other forces to create the path
that we are on.
This study consists of four parts and 17 chapters. Part 1 describes the Big Debt Cycle, at first very simply, then in a
more complete and mechanical way, and then with some equations that show the mechanics and help with making
projections of what is likely to happen. Part 2 shows what has actually happened across 35 Big Debt Cycle cases,
laying out in a detailed template the typical sequence of events that signifies how a cycle is transpiring and shows
symptoms that can help identify how far the cycle has progressed. Part 3 reviews the most recent Big Debt Cycle,
which started when the new monetary and world orders began in 1944 at the end of World War II and brings it up
to the present. In that part, in addition to looking at the Big Debt Cycle and the overall Big Cycle with a focus on the
US (because it has been the world’s major reserve currency country and the world’s leading power, thus making it
the world’s leading shaper of what one might call the American world order since 1944), I also very briefly describe
the Big Cycles of both China and Japan, showing them from the 1860s until now. This will give you a more complete
picture of what has happened in the world since 1944 and provide two other Big Debt Cycle cases to look at. Finally,
in Part 4, I will peek into the future, looking at what my calculations say about what is required for the US to manage
its debt burden, and how the five big forces might unfold in the years ahead.
Because I recognize that there are different readers who have different levels of expertise and want to give different
amounts of time to this and I want to help you get what you want out of this, I put the most important points in
bold so you can read just the most essential stuff and optionally dive into the details that interest you. Also, I put
what I believe are timeless and universal principles in bold maroon. If you are a professional or aspiring professional
who is really into economics and markets, I recommend that you read the whole thing because I believe that it will
give you a unique perspective that you will enjoy and will help you to be successful in your job. If you are not, I
recommend that you just read what is in bold. Also, because I’d love to have a two-way conversation with you to try
to get in sync about what’s true and what to do about it, I am working on a few new technologies for doing that,
which I will tell you about later.
In the next chapter, I will describe the Big Debt Cycle in just seven pages. If you want to stop there, that’s perfectly
fine.
I hope that you will find the study’s analysis helpful.

Part 1:
Overview of the Big Debt Cycle

Chapter 1: The Big Debt Cycle in a Tiny Nutshell
My goal for this chapter is to convey in seven pages a very brief but complete description of the mechanics of a
typical Big Debt Cycle.

How the Machine Works
Credit is the primary vehicle for funding spending and it can easily be created. 2 Because one person’s spending is
another’s earnings, when there is a lot of credit creation, people spend and earn more, most asset prices go up,
and most everyone loves it. Paying back debt is much less enjoyable. As a result, central governments and central
banks have a bias toward creating a lot of credit. Credit also creates debt that has to be paid back, which has the
opposite effect—i.e., when debts have to be paid back, it creates less spending, lower incomes, and lower asset
prices, which people don’t like. In other words, when someone (a borrower-debtor) borrows money (called
principal) at a cost (an interest rate), the borrower-debtor can spend more money than they have in earnings and
savings over the near term. But over the long term, this requires them to pay back (the principal + interest) and
when they have to pay it back, it requires them to spend less money than they have. This dynamic is why the
credit/spending/debt-paying-back dynamic is inherently cyclical.

The Short-Term Debt Cycle
Everyone who has been around long enough to be affected by it several times should be well-acquainted with the
short-term debt cycle. It starts with money and credit being provided readily when economic activity and inflation
are lower than desired, and when interest rates are low relative to inflation rates and low in relation to the rates
of return on other investments. Those conditions encourage borrowing to spend and invest, which causes asset
prices, economic activity, and inflation to pick up until they are higher than desired, at which time money and
credit are restrained, and interest rates become relatively high in relation to inflation rates and rates of return on
other investments. This leads to less borrowing to spend and invest, which leads to lower asset prices, a slowing
of economic activity, and lower inflation, which leads interest rates to come down, money and credit to become
easier, and the cycle to begin again. These cycles have typically lasted about six years, give or take three years.

Short-Term Debt Cycles Add up to Big, Long-Term Debt Cycles
What isn’t paid enough attention is the way in which these short-term debt cycles add up to big, long-term debt
cycles. Because credit is a stimulant that creates a high, people want more of it, so there is a bias toward creating
it. This leads debt to rise over time, which typically leads to most of the short-term cyclical highs and lows in debt
to be higher than the ones before. These add up to create the long-term debt cycle, which ends when it becomes
unsustainable. The capacity to take on more debt is different early in the Big Debt Cycle when debt burdens are
lower and there is more potential for credit/debt to be able to fund highly profitable endeavors than it is later in
the cycle when debt burdens are higher, and lenders have fewer productive options.
In that early part, it is easy to borrow—even to borrow a lot—and pay it back. These early short-term cycles are
primarily driven by the previously described availability and economics of borrowing and spending, and also a
lingering cautiousness brought about by memories of the pain of the most recent time when money was tight. 3
Early in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and total debt service are relatively low in relation to incomes and other
assets, increases and decreases in credit, spending, debt, and debt service are primarily determined by the
previously described incentives with less risk. But late in the Big Debt Cycle, when debts and debt service costs
get high relative to income and the value of other assets that can be used to meet one’s debt service obligations,
the risks of default are higher. Also, late in the Big Debt Cycle, when there are a lot of debt assets and liabilities
relative to income, the balancing act of trying to keep interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors
without having them too high for borrower-debtors becomes more challenging. That’s because one person’s debts
are another’s assets and both must be satisfied. So, while short-term debt cycles end because of the previously
2 The “fractional reserve banking system” can lend more money than is deposited because the same money can be lent several times.

3 This cautiousness is reflected in market pricing. For example, during the early stages of the cycle the yields and expected returns of “risky

assets” are very high relative to those of “low-risk assets.”

described economic considerations, long-term debt cycles end because the debt burdens are too great to be
sustained. Said differently, because it is more enjoyable to borrow and spend, if one isn’t careful, debt and debt
service can grow like a cancer, eating up one’s buying power and squeezing out other consumption. This is what
makes the long-term Big Debt Cycle.
Throughout the millennia and across countries, what has driven the Big Debt Cycle and has created the big market
and economic problems that go along with it is the creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and
debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment assets in existence.
Said more simply, a debt is a promise to deliver money. A debt crisis occurs when there have been more promises
made than there is money to deliver on them. When that happens, the central bank is forced to choose between
a) printing a lot of money and devaluing it or b) not printing a lot of money and having a big debt default crisis. In
the end, they always print and devalue. Either way—via default or devaluation—the creation of too much debt
eventually causes debt assets (e.g., bonds) to be worth less.
While there are variations in how each of these cases plays out, the most important factor is whether the debt is
denominated in a currency that the central bank can “print”. But no matter the variation we almost always see
that it becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (i.e., bonds) relative to holding the productive
capacity of the economy (i.e., equities) and/or owning other, more stable forms of money (e.g., gold).
To me it is interesting and inappropriate that, when credit rating agencies rate the credit of a central government,
they don’t rate the riskiness of its debt losing value. They only rate the risk of default on the debt, which gives the
misimpression that all higher-rated debt is a safe storehold of value. Said differently, because central banks can bail
out central governments, the riskiness of central governments’ debts are hidden. Creditors would be better served
if the rating agencies rated the riskiness of the debt losing value through both default and devaluation. After all,
these bonds are supposed to be storeholds of wealth and should be rated as such. As you will see in this study, that
is how I look at bonds. For countries with debts denominated in their own currencies (i.e., in a currency they can
print), I rate central governments’ debts separately from their central banks to show how risky they are, and I rate
the risks of central banks’ debts by considering the risk of the devaluation of money to be as, if not more, probable
than a default on government debt.
Default or devaluation, I don’t care. What I care about is losing my storehold of wealth, which inevitably will
happen one way or another.

Following the Debt Cycle’s Progression
The main difference between a short-term debt cycle and a long-term (big) debt cycle has to do with the central
bank’s ability to turn them around. For the short-term debt cycle, its contraction phase can be reversed with a
heavy dose of money and credit that brings the economy up from a depressed disinflationary state because the
economy has the capacity to produce another phase of noninflationary growth. But the long-term debt cycle’s
contraction phase cannot be reversed by producing more money and credit because existing levels of debt growth
and debt assets are unsustainable and holders of debt assets want to get out of them because they believe that,
one way or another, they will be poor storeholds of wealth.
Think of the Big Debt Cycle’s progression like the progression of a disease or a life cycle through stages that exhibit
different symptoms. By identifying these symptoms one can identify approximately where the cycle is in its
progression with some expectations of how it is likely to progress from there. Described most simply, the Big Debt
Cycle moves from sound/hard money and credit to increasingly loose money and credit to a debt bust that leads to
a return to sound/hard money and credit brought about by necessity. More specifically, at first there is heathy
borrowing by the private sector that can be paid back; then the private sector overborrows, has losses, and has
problems paying it back; then the government sector tries to help, overborrows, has losses, and has problems paying
it back; then the central bank tries to help by “printing money” and buying the government debt, and has problems
paying it back, which leads it to monetize a lot more debt if it can (i.e., if the debt is denominated in the currency

that it can print). Though not all cases progress in exactly the same way, most cases progress through the following
five stages:
1) The Sound Money Stage: When net debt levels are low, money is sound, the country is competitive, and
debt growth fuels productivity growth, which creates incomes that are more than enough to pay back
the debts. This leads to increases in financial wealth and confidence.
•

Credit is the promise to deliver money. Unlike credit which requires a payment of money at a later date,
money settles transactions—i.e., if money is given the transaction is complete, whereas if credit is given
money is owed. It’s easy to create credit. Anyone can create credit but not anyone can create money. For
example, I can create credit by accepting your promise to pay me money even if you don’t have the money.
As a result, credit easily grows so there is much more credit than there is money. The most effective money
is both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth that is widely accepted around the world. At the
early stage of the Big Debt Cycle money is “hard,” which means that it is a medium of exchange that is also
a storehold of wealth that can’t easily be increased in supply, such as gold, sterling silver, and Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is now emerging as an accepted hard currency because it is a currency that is
widely accepted around the world and is limited in supply. The biggest, most common risk to money
becoming an ineffective storehold of wealth is the risk that a lot of it will be created. Imagine having the
ability to create money; who wouldn’t be tempted to do a lot of that? Those who can always are. That
creates the Big Debt Cycle. In the early part of the Big Debt Cycle, a) money is typically hard—e.g., gold—
and the paper money that circulates like money is convertible into the “hard money” at a fixed price and b)
there isn’t a lot of paper money and debt (which is the promise to pay money) outstanding. The Big Debt
Cycle consists of the building up of a) “paper money” and debt assets/liabilities relative to b) “hard money”
and real assets (e.g., goods and services) and relative to the income that is required to service the debt.
Basically, the Big Debt Cycle works like a Ponzi scheme or musical chairs with investors holding an increasing
amount of debt assets in the belief that they can convert them into money that will have buying power to
get real things, yet as the amount of the debt assets that are held up by that faith increases relative to the
real things, that conversion becomes more obviously impossible until that is realized and the process of
selling the debt to get the hard money and real assets begins.

•

At the early stage of the debt cycle, private and government debt and debt service ratios are 1) low relative
to incomes and/or 2) low relative to liquid assets. For example, government debt and debt service are low
relative to government tax revenue and/or low relative to government liquid assets (e.g., reserves and other
savings such as sovereign wealth assets) that can easily be converted into money. For example, when the
Big Debt Cycle that we are in began in 1944, the ratios of a) US government debt and b) US money supply
divided by the amount of gold the US government had were equal to a) 7x and b) 1.3x respectively, whereas
now these ratios are a) 37x and b) 6x respectively.

•

During this early stage in the cycle, debt levels, debt growth, economic growth, and inflation are neither
too hot nor too cold and finances are both sound.

•

At this stage in the cycle, “risky assets” are relatively inexpensive relative to “safe” assets. That is because
the memories of the prior period in which there was great damage done affects psychology and pricing. For
example, in the late 1940s and early 1950s stock earning’s yields were roughly 4x that of bond yields.

•

During this stage, there is a healthy economy and good investment returns that lead to the next stage.

2) The Debt Bubble Stage: When debt and investment growth are greater than can be serviced from the
incomes being produced.
•

In this stage, money is readily available and cheap, there is a debt-financed economic expansion and an
economic boom. Demands for and prices of goods, services, and investment assets are driven up by a lot of

debt-financed buying, sentiment is very bullish, and, by most conventional measures, the market is
overpriced.
•

In this stage, there are typically amazing new inventions that are truly transformative that investors invest
in without an ability or care to assess whether the present value of their future cash flows will be greater
or less than their costs.

•

This dynamic eventually produces a bubble that is reflected in the rates of debt and debt service growth to
finance speculation being greater than the income growth rates that are needed to service the debts. In
this stage, markets and economies seem great, most everyone believes that they will get better, they are
financed by a lot of borrowing, and “wealth” is created out of nothing. By wealth being created out of
nothing, I mean that there is greater imagined wealth rather than actual existing wealth. For example,
bubble periods are identifiable by extensive periods (e.g., three years) of debt growth that is significantly
faster than income growth, high asset prices relative to traditional measures of the present values of likely
future cash flows, and many other factors that I measure in my bubble indicator. (You can find the indicator
here.) A contemporary example is the unicorn that is valued at over $1 billion that has made the owner a
“billionaire” on paper but has only raised $50 million in capital because speculative venture capitalists put
in the money to get option-like chips in case it does well. Bubbles can go on a while before the top is made.
However, they inevitably lead to the next stage.

3) The Top Stage: When the bubble pops and there is a credit/debt/market/economic contraction.
•

The popping of the bubble occurs due to a combination of a tightening of money and the prior rate of debt
growth being unsustainable. It is just that simple.

•

When the bubble is popped, a self-reinforcing contraction begins so the debt problems spread very quickly,
like an aggressive cancer, so it is very important for policy makers to deal with it quickly, either to reverse
it or to guide the deleveraging to its conclusion. In most cases, the debt contraction can be temporarily
reversed by giving the system a heavy dose of what caused the debt problem—i.e., by creating more credit
and debt. That continues until it can’t continue anymore, at which time a big deleveraging occurs.

4) The Deleveraging Stage: When there is a painful bringing down of debt and debt service levels to be in
line with income levels so that the debt levels are sustainable.
At the beginning of this stage in the Big Debt Cycle, the first cracks typically spread from the private sector
to the central government and then to the central bank. Net selling of debt assets, especially net selling of
government debt assets, is a big red flag. When that happens conditions will deteriorate quickly unless
managed very well and very quickly by central governments and central banks. That selling takes the form
of runs on banks. By “runs on banks” I mean the turning in of debt assets to get real money, which lenders
like banks don’t have enough of. When debt problems become apparent, the holders of the debt assets sell
their debt assets, which drives interest rates on the debt up. This makes the debt more difficult to service,
hence more risky, which drives interest rates higher.
The selling of the government’s debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which
leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves
as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. Classically, these runs accelerate and feed on
themselves as holders of debt assets see that, one way or another (through default or through the
devaluation of their money), they will lose the buying power that they had believed was stored in these
debt assets, causing great shifts in market values and wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured,
and/or monetized. Because this tightening proves too harmful for the economy, the central bank eventually
simultaneously eases credit and allows a devaluation of the currency. The devaluation of money can itself
be the reason to sell the debt asset because it becomes a poor storehold of wealth. So, whether there is a

tightening of money that leads to debt defaults and a bad economy or an easing of money that produces a
devaluation of money and debt assets, it is not good for the debt asset. This dynamic creates what is called
a death spiral because it is a self-reinforcing, debt-contraction dynamic in which the rising interest rates
cause problems that creditors see, leading them to sell the debt assets, which leads to even higher interest
rates or the need to print more money, which devalues the money and leads to even more selling of the
debt assets and the currency and so on until the spiral runs its course. When this happens to government
debt, the realization that too much debt is the problem naturally leads to the inclination to cut spending
and borrowing. However, because one person’s spending is another’s income, cutting spending at such
times typically only contributes to increases in debt-to-income ratios. That is typically when policies are
shifted to a mix of debt restructurings and debt monetizations with the mix chosen primarily dependent on
how much of the debt is denominated in the country’s currency. This defaulting on, restructuring of, and/or
monetizing debt reduces the debt burdens relative to incomes until a new equilibrium is reached. The
movement to a stable equilibrium typically takes place via a few painful adjustment spasms because
borderline financial soundness is achieved before secure financial soundness.
•

Classically, the deleveraging process progresses as follows. Early in this recession/depression phase,
central banks bring interest rates down and make credit more available. However, when a) debts are large
and a debt contraction is underway, b) interest rates can’t be lowered any more (i.e., when they fall
around 0%), c) there is not enough demand for government debt, and d) the monetary easing is not
enough to offset the self-reinforcing depressionary pressures, the central bank is forced to switch to new
“tools” to stimulate the economy. Classically, to stimulate the economy the central bank must lower
interest rates to below nominal economic growth rates, inflation rates, and bond rates, but that is difficult
to do when they approach 0%. At the same time, the central government is typically getting itself into a
lot more debt because tax revenues are down and spending is up to support the private sector, yet there
is not enough private sector demand to buy that debt. The central government experiences a debt
squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. If there is net selling
of the debt, that creates a much worse problem.

•

Often in this deleveraging stage of the cycle there is a “pushing on a string,” a phrase coined by policy
makers in the 1930s. It occurs late in the long-term debt cycle when central bankers struggle to convert
their stimulative policies into increased spending because savers, investors, and businesses fear
borrowing and spending and/or there is deflation, so the risk-free interest that they are getting is
relatively attractive to them. At such times, it is difficult to get people to stop saving in “cash” even when
interest rates go to 0% (or even below 0%). This phase is characterized by the economy entering a
deflationary, weak, or negative growth period as people and investors hoard low-risk, typically
government-guaranteed cash.

•

At this stage, central banks must choose between keeping money “hard,” which will lead debtors to
default on their debts, which will lead to deflationary depressions, or making money “soft” by printing a
lot of it, which will devalue both it and the debt. Because paying off debt with hard money causes such
severe market and economic downturns, when faced with this choice central banks always eventually
choose to print and devalue money. Of course, each country’s central bank can only print that country’s
money, which brings me to my next big point.

•

At this stage, if it has the ability to “print money,” the central bank creates a substantial amount of money
and credit and throws it aggressively at the markets. It typically buys government debt and private sector
debt of systemically important entities that are at risk of defaulting (in order to make up for the private
sector’s inadequate demand for debt and to keep interest rates artificially low), and it sometimes buys
equities and creates incentives for people to buy goods, services, and financial assets. At this stage, it is
also typically desirable to devalue the currency because that is stimulative to the economy and raises

inflation rates thus negating the deflationary pressures. If the currency is linked to gold, silver, or
something else, that link is typically broken and there is a move to a fiat monetary system. If the currency
isn’t linked—i.e., if the currency is already a fiat currency—devaluing it relative to other storeholds of
wealth and other currencies is helpful. In some cases, the central bank’s moves can drive nominal interest
rates higher, either because the central bank tightens monetary policy to fight inflation or because it
doesn’t tighten money to fight inflation and holders of the debt don’t want to buy the newly issued
government debt and/or they want to sell it because it doesn’t provide an adequate return. It is
important to watch real and nominal interest rates and the supply and demand for debt to understand
what is happening. At such times, extraordinary policies to get money like imposing extraordinary taxes
and capital controls become common.
•

This deleveraging stage is typically a painful time when debt burdens are reduced by defaults,
restructurings, and/or devaluations. This is when an aggressive mix of debt restructurings and debt
monetizations inevitably takes place to reduce the debt and debt service burdens relative to incomes. In a
typical deleveraging the debt-to-income ratio has the be lowered by roughly 50%, give or take about 20%.
It can be done well or poorly. When it is done well, which I call a “beautiful deleveraging,” central
governments and central banks simultaneously do both debt restructurings and monetary stimulations in
a balanced way. The restructurings reduce debt burdens and are deflationary while the monetary
stimulations also reduce debt burdens (by providing money and credit to make it easier to buy debt) but
are inflationary and stimulative to the economy so, if they get the balance right, positive growth occurs
with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation. Whether done well or poorly, this is the stage of the
Big Debt Cycle that reduces a lot of the debt burden and establishes the bottom that can be built on to
begin the next Big Debt Cycle.

5) The Big Debt Crisis Recedes: When a new equilibrium is reached, and a new cycle begins.
•

In order to have a viable money/credit/debt system, it is imperative that a) money/debt is sound enough
to be a viable storehold of wealth, b) debt and debt service burdens are in line with the incomes to service
them so that debt growth is sustainable, c) creditors and debtors both believe that those things will exist,
and d) the availability of money and credit and real interest rates begin to fall in line with that which is
needed by both lender-creditors and borrower-debtors. This late phase of the Big Cycle is when there is a
movement to those things happening. It requires both psychological and fundamental adjustments. After a
big deleveraging, it is typically difficult to convince lender-creditors to lend because the
devaluations/restructurings they experienced in the deleveraging make them risk-averse, so it is imperative
that the central government and the central bank take credibility-restoring actions. These generally involve
bringing their finances in order by a) the central government earning more money than it spends and/or b)
the central bank making money hard again by offering high real yields, raising reserves, and/or linking the
currency to something hard like gold or a strong currency. Typically, in this stage, interest rates need to be
relatively high in relation to inflation rates and more than high enough to compensate for currency
weakness, so it pays to be a lender and is costly to be a borrower. This stage of the cycle can be very
attractive for lender-creditors.

The stage that the Big Debt Cycle is in is also reflected in the types of monetary policies being used. As the Big
Debt Cycle progresses, central banks have to change how they run monetary policy in order to keep the
credit/debt/economic expansion going, so by observing what type of monetary policy they are using, one can
surmise about what stage the Big Debt Cycle is in. The phases in monetary policy and the conditions that lead to
them are as follows: 4
4 This explanation of the phases differs slightly from how I have described them in my earlier writings and books, with the main difference being
that I have separated linked monetary systems from fiat ones, which were previously both described as being part of MP1. I’ve made this change

Phase 1: A Linked (i.e., Hard) Monetary System (MP1). This is the type of monetary policy that existed from
1944 until 1971. This type of monetary policy ends when the debt bubble bursts, and there is the previously
described “run on the bank” dynamic, which is a run from credit assets to the hard money, and the limited
amount of hard money causes massive defaults. This creates a compelling desire to print money rather than
leave the supply of it limited by the supply of the gold or hard money that exists to be exchanged at the
promised price.
Phase 2: A Fiat Money, Interest-Rate-Driven Monetary Policy (MP2). During this phase, interest rates, bank
reserves, and capital requirements are also controllers of the amounts of credit/debt growth. This fiat
monetary policy phase both allows more flexibility and provides less assurance that money printing won’t
be so large that it will devalue money and debt assets. The US was in this phase from 1971 until 2008. It
ends when interest rate changes no longer work (e.g., interest rates hit 0% and there is a need to ease
monetary policy) and/or the private market demand for the debt being created falls short of the supply
being sold so that, if the central bank did not print the money and buy the debt, money and credit would
be tighter and interest rates would be higher than desired.
Phase 3: A Fiat Monetary System with Debt Monetization (MP3). This type of monetary policy is
implemented by the central bank using its ability to create money and credit to buy investment assets. It is
the go-to alternative when interest rates can no longer be lowered and when private market demand for
debt assets (mostly bonds and mortgages though it can also include other financial assets like equities) is
not large enough to buy the supply at an acceptable interest rate. It is good for financial asset prices, so it
tends to benefit disproportionally those who have financial assets. It won’t effectively deliver money into
the hands of those who are financially most stressed, and it won’t be very targeted. The US was in this
phase from 2008 until 2020.
Phase 4: A Fiat Money System with Coordinated Big Fiscal Deficit and Big Debt Monetization Policy (MP4).
This type of monetary policy is used when, in order to make the system work well, central government fiscal
policy and central bank monetary policy have to be coordinated in order to get money and credit into the
hands of people and entities that need it most. While creating money and credit typically temporarily
alleviates the debt problem, it does not rectify the problem.
Phase 5: A Big Deleveraging (MP5). This is when there must be a big reduction in debt and debt service
payments through a debt restructuring and/or a debt monetization. When managed in the best possible
way—what I call a beautiful deleveraging—the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through
debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing
them), so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or
inflation. The Big Debt Cycle sequence to keep in mind is: first the private sector overborrows, has losses,
and has problems paying it back (i.e., a debt crisis); then, to help, the government overborrows, has losses,
and has problems paying it back; then, to help out, the central bank buys the government debt and takes
losses. To fund those purchases and to fund other debtors in trouble (because it is the “lender of last
resort”), the central bank prints a lot of money and buys a lot of debt. Then, at its worst, the central bank
loses a lot of money on the debt it bought.
o

While it is said that modern central bank “prints” money to buy the debt, the central bank doesn’t
literally “print money.” Instead, it borrows money (reserves) from commercial banks that it pays a
very short-term interest rate on. At its most extreme, the central bank can lose money because
the interest earnings it gets on the debt it bought are less than the interest that it has to pay out

because I think it is important to draw a distinction between linked and fiat systems. The definitions of the other monetary policies (debt
monetization, fiscal-monetary coordination) have remained the same, but the numbering is now different (i.e., MP2 has become MP3 and MP3
has become MP4).

on the money it borrowed, so when these amounts become large it can find itself in a selfreinforcing spiral of having to buy debt, which leads it to have losses and negative cash flows which
leads it to need to print more money to service its debt and to need to buy more debt which ends
up having more losses which requires it to do more of the same. This is the “death spiral” I
mentioned earlier. When done in large amounts, the “printing” devalues the money and creates
inflationary recessions or depressions. If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money on its
bond holdings because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the
interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. This is notable but not a big red flag until
the central bank has a very large negative net worth and is forced to “print” more money to
cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than
has to go out to service its liabilities. That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke:
while the central bank doesn’t default on its debts, it can’t make its debt service payments without
printing money.
o

Eventually the debt restructurings and debt monetizations reduce the size of the debts relative to
incomes and the debt cycle runs its course.

Phase 6: The Return to Hard Money (MP6). In this phase the central government takes actions to restore
the soundness of its money and credit/debt. This type of monetary policy occurs after the debt has been
written down through debt defaults/restructurings and debt monetizations so the debt levels relative to
the incomes and amounts of money that are available to service the debts can be brought back into
alignment. As previously described, it comes after those who held the debt assets were burned by the
defaults and/or inflationary periods, so confidence in holding debt assets has to be rebuilt. At this stage,
countries typically go back to MP1 (i.e., a hard-asset-backing monetary policy) or MP2 (an interest
rate/money supply-targeted monetary policy) that is beneficial to lender-creditors via high real interest
rates.
•

For great countries with great empires, the end of the Big Debt Cycle has meant the end of their
prominence.

A Few Concluding Observations
•

It pays to build up savings in the good times so there are savings to draw on in the bad times.
There are costs to having too much savings as well as too little savings, and no one gets the
balance exactly right.

•

Big debt crises are inevitable. Throughout history only a very few well-disciplined countries have
avoided them. That is because lending is never done perfectly relative to the incomes that are needed
to service it. And it is often done badly because people always want more credit and that turns into
debt. Debt levels get beyond that which is sustainable which leads to the need to bring the debt
burdens down which typically leads to a mixture of debt defaults/restructurings and the creating of
money and credit, leading a debt crisis to occur. And people’s psychology reinforces the cycle: the
bubble period makes people more optimistic causing them to borrow more, and the bust causes people
to be more pessimistic causing them to cut spending. Even though this progression has happened many
times in history, most policy makers and investors think their current circumstances and monetary system
won’t change. The change is unthinkable—and then it happens suddenly.

•

The best way to anticipate a debt crisis happening is not by focusing on a single influence or
number like debt as a percent of GDP; it is by understanding and focusing on a number of
interrelated dynamics that we will get into, especially in the next two chapters.

•

If debts are denominated in a country’s own currency, its central bank can and will “print” the
money to alleviate the debt crisis. This allows them to manage it better than if they couldn’t print

the money, but of course it also reduces the value of the money. If the debt is not denominated in
currencies that their central banks can print, then they will have debt defaults and deflationary
depressions measured in the currency that they owe and can’t print.
•

All debt crises, even big ones, can be managed well by economic policy makers restructuring
and monetizing them so that the deflationary ways of reducing the debt burdens (i.e., writing off
and restructuring debt) and the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (creating money and
credit and giving it to the debtors to make it easier for them to service their debts) balance each
other. The key is to spread the paying back over time. For example, if the debt-to-income ratio
needs to fall by about 50% to make it sustainable, a debt restructuring that spreads it out to be at a rate
of 3% or 4% per year would be much less traumatic than one that is about 50% in one year.

•

Debt crises provide great risks and opportunities that have been shown to both destroy
empires and provide great investment opportunities for investors if they understand how they
work and have good principles for navigating them well.

•

If you try to focus on debt cycles precisely or focus your attention on the short term you won’t see
them. It’s like comparing two snowflakes and missing that they are pretty much the same because they’re
not exactly the same.

That’s it in a nutshell.
In the rest of this study I will get into the mechanics in greater depth, show the actual archetypical sequences that
have played out over 35 cases, look at how the Big Debt Cycle and Big Cycle that includes the other big cycles (for
instance, cycles of internal and external order) that started in 1944 and that we are currently in the late stages of
have transpired relative to this template, and briefly look at the Chinese and Japanese Big Cycles and a number of
other cases. The Japanese case is interesting because Japan is further along in its Big Debt Cycle. Notably its large
debt and debt monetizations have led to the depreciation of its currency and debt, which led holders of its bonds to
have losses of 45% relative to holding US dollar debt since 2013 and losses of 60% relative to holding gold since 2013.
In the final chapters, I will share how I am processing the US today relative to this template, how the US could
reduce the risk of an acute debt crisis, and how I read the Five Big Forces today.

Chapter 2: The Mechanics in Words and Concepts
Note: This chapter gives unconventional concepts about the mechanics of how markets work that I believe would
be valuable for professionals and aspiring professionals but are probably beyond the interests of others. I suggest
that you give it a try to see whether or not it’s the sort of thing you’d like to get into.
Because everything that happens has reasons that make it happen, it appears to me that everything changes like a
perpetual motion machine. To understand this machine, one needs to understand its mechanics, and because
everything affects everything else, these mechanics are very complex. As a result of breakthroughs in artificial
intelligence, I believe that we are on the brink of almost understanding it all, but for now we have to labor along the
old-fashioned way, with people studying what happened using contemporary computers to aid them. That’s how I
created this description of the mechanics of the debt/credit/money/economic dynamic, which is, of course, only one
big part of the greater dynamic. In my feeble attempts to understand and describe the most important mechanics
that change the world as we know it, I do these in-depth studies and then try to create more simplified explanations
of them. 5 Keep in mind that this is a very simplified picture.
•

Zooming out to the highest level, the five most important drivers of change that are important to
understand are:
•
•
•
•
•

The debt/credit/money/economic cycle
The internal political order/disorder cycle
The external geopolitical order/disorder cycle
Acts of nature (droughts, floods, and pandemics)
Human inventiveness, most importantly of new technologies

These are the biggest forces that affect each other to shape the biggest things that happen. If you want to understand
what I learned from experiencing and studying them in a more complete way than I can cover in this study, you can
read about them in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.
In this study, we are going to examine the first of those—the credit/debt/money/economic dynamic—focusing
most intensely on the late part of the longer-term debt cycle when central governments and central banks go
broke. I will start by a) walking you through some mechanics of how market prices are determined and then b)
looking at how the long-term debt cycle works. With that as a background, I will then turn to c) the archetypical
sequence that leads to a country hitting the limits of debt and money and central banks and central governments
“going broke.” At the same time, we will be exploring the other four forces because the interactions of these five
forces cannot be overlooked in observing the resulting overall Big Cycle. From what I can see, we are likely entering
the very turbulent stage in the overall Big Cycle driven by the interactions of these five big forces, and the resulting
changes in the world order will be big. I hope this study can contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics
and better decision making to produce the best outcome possible.

5 For example, in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order, I measured and looked at the most important cause/effect
relationships that changed the world over the last 500 years and simplified my description of how I see them to consist of the five big forces.

How the Machine Works
To me, money and credit are the lifeblood of the economy. They circulate nutrients (i.e., spending power) from
the parts of the system that have excess amounts of it to the parts of the system that can best use it. The central
government is like the brain that directs how the system works while also taking in and using some of the money
and credit (typically about 15-30% of it) 6 to perform its functions (e.g., providing for social programs, defense,
etc.). The central bank is like the heart that produces and pumps money and credit through the system. If the
exchanges go well, and those who get capital use it productively, then the providers of capital, the users of it, and
the economic system as a whole all prosper. If they don't, the system will become ill and experience trauma.
To be clear, viewing the debt dynamic as a cyclical, perpetual motion machine working in essentially the same way
through time and across countries doesn’t mean that there are not changes over time and differences between
countries. It’s just that these changes are comparatively unimportant in relation to the timeless and universal
mechanics and principles that are far less well understood than they should be. To me, it’s invaluable to first see
these timeless and universal principles of how the machine works and then focus on the differences and what they
are due to because this approach provides a richer understanding of the cause/effect relationships. For that reason,
I will start with these most important timeless and universal mechanics and principles. To convey them in brief, I will
explain just the major ones in a big-picture, simplified way rather than a detailed and precise way. In this big-picture,
simplified model, the following describes the major parts and major players and how they operate together to make
the machine work.

6 Typically, 35-55% of all spending (if you include state and local governments) in developed countries comes from government spending.

The Five Major Parts and How They Work
There are five major parts of the economic system that make up my simplified model of the machine. They are:
•
•
•
•
•

goods, services, and investment assets,
money used to buy these things,
credit issued to buy these things,
debt liabilities that are created when purchases are made with credit, and
debt assets (i.e., deposits and bonds), which, since one person’s liabilities are another’s assets, are the
other side of the debt liabilities.

If you can understand the transactions that occur as being made up of these five major parts, you can pretty much
understand why there are big debt and economic cycles. To start, I will walk through how I think about
transactions, and some other important baseline mechanics.
As mentioned, goods, services, and investment assets can be bought with either money or credit.
Money, unlike credit, settles transactions. For example, if you buy a car with money, after the transaction, you’re
both done. What has constituted money has changed throughout history and across currencies. For long periods of
history, money was a promise to deliver a certain amount of gold or other hard asset. In fiat monetary systems,
which we’ve been in since the US left the gold standard in 1971, money is what central banks print and is more like
a form of credit in that it is a promise to deliver buying power, not an actual hard asset. But money is different from
credit as, at this time, it can only be created by central banks 7 and can be created in whatever amounts the central
banks choose to create.
Credit, unlike money, leaves a lingering obligation to pay, and it can be created by mutual agreement of any willing
parties. Credit produces buying power that didn’t exist before, without necessarily creating money. It allows
borrowers to spend more than they earn, which pushes up the demand and prices for what is being bought over the
near term while creating debt that, over the longer term, requires the borrowers, who are now debtors, to spend
less than they earn as they pay back their debts. This reduces demand and prices in the future, which contributes to
the cyclicality of the system. Because debt is the promise to deliver money and central banks determine the amount
of money in existence, central banks have a lot of power. Though not exactly proportional, the more money that is
in existence, the more credit and spending there can be; the less money in existence, the less credit and spending
there can be.
Now let’s look at how prices are set.
To explain my approach for understanding how prices are set, which is different from the conventional
economist’s approach, I need to start at the most basic building block for understanding all markets and
economics, which is the transaction. All markets and all economics are simply the aggregates of the transactions
that make them up, and a transaction is simply the buyer giving money (or credit) to a seller and the seller giving
a good, a service, or a financial asset to the buyer in exchange. The price in a transaction equals the amount of
money/credit the buyer gives divided by the quantity of whatever the seller gives in that transaction, and a
market is the aggregate of those transactions. For example, a transaction to buy wheat occurs when a buyer
gives a certain amount of total money to a seller in exchange for a certain quantity of wheat, and a market
consists of all the buyers and sellers making exchanges for the same things—e.g., the wheat market consists of
different people making different transactions for different reasons over time—and these many exchanges are
what determine the price. So…

7 Bitcoin is an example of an attempt to create a private version of money using blockchain, a distributed ledger technology.

Price (P) = the amount spent on something ($)/the total quantity of it that is sold (Q)
Or, more simply
P = $/Q
In other words, since the price of any good, service, or financial asset equals the total amount spent by buyers
($) divided by the total quantity sold by sellers (Q), if you know total spending (total $) and you know the total
quantity sold (total Q), you will know the price and everything else you need to know. That is indisputably how
it is, so it is indisputable that the best way to estimate the price is to estimate the total spending and divide it by
the total quantity sold. And what is the best way to estimate these things? It is to understand the motivations of
the buyers and sellers. All buyers have their own reasons for spending the amounts of money that they are
spending to get the quantity they are buying, and all sellers have their own reasons for selling the quantity they are
selling to get the money they’re getting. What I’m saying is conveyed in the conceptual diagram below.

While this might look and sound complicated, it’s really not. For each product, the buyers and
sellers have their reasons for making those purchases and sales, and it’s pretty easy to
determine who the main buyers and sellers are and what motivates them. If you can figure out
major buyers' reasons for spending and you know the major sellers' reasons for selling, you
can pretty accurately predict their actions, and thus the price.
This way of looking at price determination is very different from how most economists look at it. The traditional
way measures both demand and supply in terms of quantity (i.e., quantity bought and quantity sold), where my
approach looks at amount spent to buy instead of quantity bought. This leads to different ways of explaining why
prices change. The conventional approach describes price changes as occurring because the quantity demanded
and/or the quantity supplied changes. How these changes occur is called price elasticity. This way of looking at

the market implies that there is one elasticity of demand and one elasticity of supply, and different theories
emerge about how the market digests information.
I don't think that approach makes sense because it assumes that a change in supply will always have the same
effect on price (i.e., elasticity), which isn’t true. For example, if more money is spent on a product because buyers
have more money to spend, the price of that product will be higher. Ultimately, if your goal is to understand and
predict price movements, you are much better off trying to connect who is doing what in the market with how
prices are changing. I started doing this as a commodities trader back in the 1970s and found that, not only did
this approach work better for me than more conventional approaches, it could also apply to all kinds of products
and assets, including financial ones. In fact, I use this template to model not just how specific markets work but
entire economies, but that’s a subject for another time.
If you play with the previously shown formula/model a bit, you will see that prices change when there are changes
in the rates of spending and/or quantities sold. For example, if the rate of buying goes from (X) to (X minus 10%),
and all else stays the same, the price will fall by 10%. So, if you identify rates of unsustainable buying and/or rates
of unsustainable selling, you can identify price and economic reversals ahead of them occurring. And if you
calculate what a return to a more normal level of buying/selling is, you can calculate the approximate price change
that is needed and likely.
There are a number of other implications for how this different approach leads to unique perspectives on how
economies and markets work. But the most important one for understanding short-term market and economic
cycles is that it shows how these cycles are driven more by creations of money and credit that lead to changes in
spending (S) than by the changes in the quantity sold (Q) because most goods, services, and investment assets are
produced to satisfy demand (i.e., in response to S). I also see that:
When a) more money and credit are created (so there is more spending) and b) producers have the capacity to
produce more quantity, then c) there can be more non-inflationary growth because both spending ($) and the
quantity (Q) sold increase.
whereas
When a) more money and credit are created (so there is more spending), but b) there is
little or no capacity so producers can’t produce much more, then c) there is little real
growth and a lot more inflation.
These principles explain why the early cycle (when there is plenty of excess capacity and central banks are
stimulative) is characterized by strong growth and little inflation and the late cycle typically has weak growth and big
price rises. That is what cyclical inflation and growth look like. Later in this study, we will go through this in more
detail and explore what monetary inflations and inflationary depressions look like.
How does productivity fit into the above? If productivity growth is high, producers can produce more quantity (Q)
as more money and credit are produced, so it allows non-inflationary growth to continue for longer. Of course,
productivity can be hard to measure directly, as productivity can also show up as products improving in quality, or
the marginal cost of producing something falling all the way to zero (as has happened for producing photos and
electronic books).
Now let’s look more closely at the reasons buyers spend and sellers sell the quantities they sell. Instead of doing
that for all the individual items, I will look at the big categories to convey the principles that affect them all.
•

People buy goods and services to use, and they buy investments to make money (i.e., as
storeholds of wealth). How much they spend on goods and services versus investments depends on what
the goods and services they want to use cost relative to the amount of money and credit they have to
spend, and the relative appeal of spending on goods and services to that of spending on financial assets.

And of course, they have their own reasons for choosing which goods and services and which financial
assets they buy.
•

What people choose to spend their money and credit on is based on the relative appeal of the
items. People are constantly making comparisons in two dimensions: 1) one item for another (e.g., money
for corn, gold, currency, just about everything else) and 2) the same item for delivery at different points in
time (e.g., corn, gold, currency for delivery today versus for delivery a year in the future) based on their
preferences. As a result, there is an enormous array of relative-appeal assessments to be made. Arbitrages
and relatively sure bets are the most powerful types of bets in determining relative pricing.

•

Currencies are mediums of exchange and storeholds of wealth (in debt assets). In other words,
they facilitate both transactions and investing.

•

Investments are exchanges of money and credit today for money and credit in the future.

•

All investment markets derive their value by providing money in two ways: through
their yields and through their price changes. Together they make the total return. So, for all
investments, total return = yield + price change.

•

By and large, all investment markets compete with each other on the basis of the total returns
they provide. That is because a) most investors care more about the total returns they get than they care
about whether it comes in the form of yield or price appreciation 8 and b) there is an ability to arbitrage
investments based on their total returns. 9
To show how that works, let’s look at how investing in bonds would be compared with investing in gold to
determine the price relationship. Because gold has no yield and a US Treasury bond has a yield of X% (e.g.,
5%), it would be illogical for anyone to buy gold unless the price is expected to go up by more than X% per
year (e.g., 5% per year). Said differently, the market is priced for the gold price to rise by 5% relative to the
price of Treasuries. Investors form their views about what will determine the gold price change (e.g., one
big factor is the amount of inflation based on the amount of money and credit that is produced), and they
look at the relative attractiveness of the 5% yield that the bonds are offering and the extent the gold price
would appreciate due to the depreciation in the value of money. If they think that gold will rise by less than
5%, they can buy bonds and sell gold, and if they think gold will go up more than 5%, they can do the reverse.
In either case, they’ll make money if they’re right. On top of this simple price analysis, there is a lot of
financial engineering (e.g., leveraging and hedging) that turns one thing into the equivalent of another to
make relative value bets and arbitrages that create a whole matrix of market prices.
An enormous amount of money is allocated in this way, and it would be easy to make a lot of money if the
choices between options were easy. But because we know it’s not easy to make money in the markets, we
can assume that the markets do a pretty good job of making these estimates and pricing assets correctly.
At the same time, because I and others who have been successful at investing couldn’t have been successful
at investing if the markets were perfect, we can assume that it’s not perfectly done and there are
opportunities to make money in the markets if you have a better understanding than others. Anyway, my
main point is that this is how to determine how markets are priced, which you will soon see is helpful in
understanding the debt/credit/money/economic dynamic.

8
While it’s by and large true that all investments compete on just a total return basis, it’s not totally true because different investors have different
objectives and considerations so that at some times these different objectives and the differences in the supplies of investments to meet the
demands can lead to some investments having more attractive returns than others. However, because there is a profit to be made by shorting
the asset that has the lower risk-adjusted return to fund the one that has the higher risk-adjusted return, there is a strong tendency for these
differences to shrink to be rather small.
9 I can make money by buying an investment that has a higher total return while selling an investment that has a lower total return.

•

The expected rates of return on investment assets relative to the rate of inflation (i.e., the expected real
returns of investments) will influence how much money goes into each of these. By and large an
investment’s inflation-adjusted (“real”) returns are more important than its non-inflation (i.e., nominal)
returns because a) investments are made to be storeholds of wealth so buying power matters most, and
b) there are arbitrages and relative value bets between real assets and financial assets that drive their
relative prices. In other words, the expected returns of putting money into financial investments are
compared with the expected returns of putting money into real stuff (e.g., real estate, precious metals,
commodities, art, etc.), so the returns of all investments, especially the returns of government bonds
(because their returns are so well known since the yield is set and there is virtually no risk of default for
bonds denominated in a country’s own currency), are compared with the inflation rate, so when bond yields
are low relative to inflation, bonds will be sold and inflation assets will be bought, and vice versa. Also,
because the decline in the value of money and credit that arises from central banks creating lots of both
causes the prices of goods, services, and most financial assets to rise, when central banks create a lot of
money and credit, that tends to lead investors to favor inflation-hedge assets.

•

Prices are linked by certain determinants that one must understand to understand relative pricing. When
most non-professional investors think about the price, they usually think about the price for delivery of the
item today, which is called the spot price. Most markets also have prices for deliveries sometime in the
future, which are called forward (or futures) prices, and there are arbitrages or relative value bets that one
can take that determine the price relationship of the same items at different delivery dates. 10 The same
sort of analysis of the relative appeal of the same financial assets (e.g., short-term government debt and
long-term government debt) takes place (e.g., a big factor determining that is the projected pace at which
the central bank will increase or decrease interest rates).

Debt Is Currency and Currency Is Debt
Since a debt asset is the promise to receive a specified amount of currency at a future date, debt and currency are
essentially the same things. If you don't like the currency, you must not like the debt asset (e.g., bonds), and if you
don't like the bonds, you must not like the currency, if you take into consideration their relative yields. (In other
words, if you don’t like one you must not like the other.) Remember the gold/bond price comparison process
described earlier of looking at the relative yields + the expected price changes = the relative total returns. This sets
the spot and futures prices for bonds and gold, and it works the same for assessing the value of different currencies
and different debt assets of different countries. That assessment drives capital flows in important ways that are very
relevant to the debt issue at hand.
More specifically:
Let’s say the government interest rate (which is widely considered default-risk-free because government central
banks can print money to make payments) in one country (e.g., Japan) is below that in another country by X% per
year. If that’s the case, then the expected appreciation in that currency must be at the same percentage rate.
Otherwise, it would be easy to make virtually risk-free profits (by owning the bonds with the higher interest rate).
Instead, the difference in the interest rates is expected to be eaten up by the higher interest rate currency falling
compared to the lower interest rate currency.
But what if that currency change is not expected to offset the interest rate difference? For example, if the 10-year
interest rate in Country A is lower (e.g., 3% lower) than that in Country B’s currency-denominated bond, you’d
ordinarily expect Country A’s currency to rise (to eat up the difference from the higher interest rate). What if, instead,
Country A’s currency is expected to fall (e.g., by 2% per year)? In that case, there is virtually risk-free profit to be
For example, for items that can be stored, the price premium of the forward (or futures) price over the spot price won’t be more than the
cost of storing it (including the interest expense on the money tied up with it in inventory). For items that will be stored (e.g., gold), the spot
price will be determined by the expected future price minus the storage cost, rather than the future price being determined by the spot price
plus the storage cost.

10

made. Investors will flock into the trade, selling the lower-yielding currency/debt. That will produce one of two
adjustments (or a combination):
A) the spot currency will have to fall (by 40% in this example 11), or
B) the 10-year interest rate will have to rise by 5%, which will send the bond prices down by
about 40%. 12
Or if those adjustments can’t happen (say there are capital controls or the like)—if the interest stays 3% less and the
currency falls by 2%—then the loss relative to holding Country B’s bonds will be 5% per year, which over the 10 years
will compound to 40%.
Any way you cut it, the bond return in Country A’s currency will be very bad. 13 If the nominal bond returns are not
bad (i.e., the bonds do not depreciate and debt burdens are not reduced in nominal terms) because neither a) the
price of the bonds falls in the local currency because the interest rates rise to provide an appropriate return in light
of the declining value of the currency, nor b) the currency declines to a level that makes it cheap enough to provide
adequate price appreciation to make up for the interest rates being too low, then the bad return of the bond will
come about because c) the annual interest rate and weakness in the currency will not compensate for the inflation. 14
Now that we understand how the mechanics of these major parts work, and how transactions are driven by the
motivations of players in dealing with those parts, you will understand how the machine works and what is likely to
happen next, so let’s get into that.

11 Here’s the math: If a currency is expected to depreciate by 2% per year, that means the forward price is 82% of the current price (2%
depreciation compounded for 10 years). The spot needs to be priced to appreciate by 3% each year until it reaches the current 10-year forward
price of 82%. A spot price of 0.61 x 1.03^10 = 0.82. So, the spot must fall from 1 to 0.61 (which is a ~40% move).
12
Here’s the (somewhat simpler) math: The price impact of an interest rate move on bonds is the change in yield x the duration. The duration
of 10-year government bonds is 7-8 years, depending on the country: 8 x 5% = 40%.
13 From a central banker’s perspective, the currency weakness and inflation can be good because they reduce the debt burden, which happens
when the nominal interest rate is below the nominal growth rate, and especially when the nominal interest rate is below the inflation rate (i.e.,
when real interest rates are negative).
14 Keep in mind that the different inflation rates in the different countries are typically more due to the differences in the rates of changes in the
values of their money/currencies (which are more due to the changing supplies of money and credit) than they are due to the changing values of
the items being bought and sold when measured in a common currency.

The Major Types of Players and How They Behave to Drive What Happens
Five major types of players drive money and debt cycles. They are:
• those that borrow and become debtors that I call borrower-debtors, which can be private or government
entities,
• those that lend and become creditors that I call lender-creditors, which can be private or government entities,
• those that intermediate the money and credit transactions between the lender-creditors and the borrowerdebtors, which are commonly called banks,
• central governments, and
• government-controlled central banks, which can create money and credit in the country’s currency and
influence the cost of money and credit.
Credit/debt expansions can only take place when both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors are willing
to borrow and lend, so the deal must be good for both. Said differently, because one person’s debts are
another’s assets, for the system to work, it takes both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors to want to enter into
these transactions. However, what is good for one is quite often bad for the other. For example, for borrowerdebtors to do well, interest rates can’t be too high, while for lender-creditors to do well, interest rates can’t be too
low. If interest rates are too high for borrower-debtors, they will have to slash spending or sell assets to service
their debts, or they might not be able to pay them back, which will lead markets and the economy to fall. At the
same time, if interest rates are too low to compensate lender-creditors, they won’t lend and will sell their debt
assets, causing interest rates to rise or central banks to print a lot of money and buy debt in an attempt to hold
interest rates down. This printing of money/buying of debt will create inflation, causing a contraction in wealth
and economic activity.
Over time, environments shift between those that are good and bad for lender-creditors and borrower-debtors. To
be effective, it is critical that anyone who is involved in any way in markets and economies knows how to tell the
difference. This balancing act and the swings between the two environments take place naturally, and sometimes
conditions make it impossible to achieve a good balance. That causes big debt, market, and economic risks. Before I
describe the conditions that produce these risks, I want to first explain the other players’ motivations and how they
try to act on them.
Private sector banks 15 are the intermediaries between lender-creditors and borrower-debtors, so their
motivations and how they work are important too. In all countries for thousands of years, banks have done
essentially the same thing, which is to try to make profits by borrowing money from some and lending it to others,
earning money on the spread. How they do this creates the money/credit/debt cycles, most importantly the
unsustainable bubbles and big debt crises. How are these bubbles and crises created? By the banks lending out a
lot more money than they have, which they do by repeatedly borrowing at a cost that is lower than the return
they take in from lending. That works well for the society and is profitable for the banks when those who are lent
money use it productively enough to pay back their loans—and when those the banks borrowed from don’t want
their money back in amounts that are greater than what the banks actually have. But debt crises happen when
the loans aren’t adequately paid back or when the banks’ creditors want to get more of the money they lent to
the banks than the banks are able to give them.
Over the long run, debts can’t rise faster than the incomes that are needed to service them, and interest rates
can’t be too high for borrower-debtors or too low for lender-creditors for very long. If debts keep rising faster than
incomes and/or interest rates are too high for borrower-debtors or too low for lender-creditors for too long, the
imbalance will cause a big market and economic crisis. For that reason, it pays to watch these ratios.

15 For simplicity I am using the word “banks” to describe all financial intermediaries that take on financial liabilities to get higher returns in financial
assets.

Big debt crises come about when the amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities become too large relative to the
amount of money in existence and/or the amounts of goods and services in existence.
Central banks either directly or indirectly create money and credit, which is “buying power.” Buying power
determines the total amount of spending on goods, services, and investment assets. Whatever amount of money
and credit is created must be put into goods, services, and/or financial assets (i.e., investments). So, the total
amount of money and credit created determines the total amount of spending on goods, services, and financial
assets. As a result, goods, services, and financial assets tend to rise and decline together with the ebbs and flows of
money and credit, like all boats tend to rise and fall with the ebbs and flows of the sea. What this money and credit
go into and the quantities of goods, services, and financial assets that are produced are mostly determined by the
choices made by thousands or millions of market participants.
Central banks came into existence to smooth these cycles, most importantly by handling big debt crises. Until
relatively recently (e.g., 1913 in the United States), there weren’t central banks in most countries, and money that
was in private banks was typically either physical gold or silver or paper certificates to get gold and silver. Throughout
these times, there were boom-bust cycles because borrower-debtors, lender-creditors, and banks went through the
credit/debt cycles I just described. These cycles turned into big debt and economic busts when too many debt
assets and liabilities led to lender-creditor “runs” to get money from borrower-debtors, most importantly the
banks. These runs produced debt/market/economic collapses that eventually led governments to create central
banks to lend money to banks and others when these big debt crises happened. Central banks can also smooth
the cycles by varying interest rates and the amount of money and credit in the system to change the behaviors of
borrower-debtors and lender-creditors. Where do central banks get their money from? They “print” it (literally and
digitally), which, when done in large amounts, alleviates the debt problems because it provides money and credit to
those who desperately need it and wouldn’t have had it otherwise. But doing so also reduces the buying power of
money and debt assets and raises inflation from what it would have been.
Central banks want to keep debt and economic growth and inflation at acceptable levels. In other words, they
don’t want debt and demand to grow much faster or slower than is sustainable and they don’t want inflation to
be so high or so low that it is harmful. To influence these things, they raise interest rates and tighten the
availability of money or they lower interest rates and ease the availability of money, which influences lendercreditors and borrower-debtors who are striving to be profitable.
Central governments are political organizations with those who run them serving at the pleasure of the people, so
they want to give the people what they want. This is typically done without paying for it, which typically leads to
central government borrowing, which reinforces the cycle of creating greater amounts of credit stimulation early
and debt depressants later. When central governments do their jobs well, they tax and spend in ways that make
broad-based productivity and prosperity, sometimes borrowing more than they are earning and sometimes paying
it back, and when central banks do their jobs well, they keep the credit, debt, and capital markets in relative balance,
which produces less disruptive big swings. However, for the previously mentioned reasons, the bias to create more
ups in the economies and markets through credit stimulation leads to long-term uptrends in debt and debt service
relative to incomes until they become too large a percentage of income to be sustainable.
The greater the size of the debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the real incomes being produced, the more
difficult the balancing act is, so the greater the likelihood of a debt-caused downturn in the markets and economy.
Because borrower-debtors, lender-creditors, banks, central governments, and central banks are the biggest
players and drivers of these cycles, and because they each have obvious incentives affecting their behaviors, it is
pretty easy to anticipate what they are likely to do and what is likely to happen next. When debt growth is slow,
economies are weak, and inflation is low, central bankers will lower interest rates and create more money and
credit which will incentivize more borrowing and spending on goods, services, and investment assets which will
drive the markets for these things and the economy up. At such times, it is good to be a borrower-debtor and bad
to be a lender-creditor. When debt growth and economic growth are unsustainably fast and inflation is
unacceptably high, central bankers will raise interest rates and limit money and credit which will incentivize more

saving and less spending on goods, services, and investment assets. This will drive the markets and economy down
because it’s then better to be a lender-creditor-saver than a borrower-debtor-spender. This dynamic leads to two
interrelated cycles—a short-term one that has averaged about six years in length give or take three years and a
long-term one that has averaged about 80 years give or take 25 years—which evolve around an upward trend line
in productivity that is due to humanity’s inventiveness.
I’ll now briefly review how these cycles transpire:

The Short- and Long-Term (Big) Debt Cycles
By “short-term debt cycle,” I mean the cycle of 1) recessions that lead to 2) central banks providing a lot of credit
cheaply, which creates a lot of debt that initially leads to 3) market and economic booms that lead to 4) bubbles and
inflations, which lead to 5) central bankers tightening credit, which leads to 6) market and economic weakening. This
cycle typically lasts about six years, give or take about three. As of this writing, there have been 12.5 of these in the
US since 1945—i.e., at the time of my writing this we are about halfway through the 13th. Each short-term debt
cycle typically ends with higher levels of debt than the previous cycle because policy makers try to end recessions
by lowering interest rates enough to get borrowing going again.
By “long-term (big) debt cycle,” I mean the cycle of building up debt assets and debt liabilities over long periods of
time (i.e., successive short-term debt cycles) to amounts that eventually become unmanageable. This leads to a
combination of big debt restructurings and big debt monetizations that produce a period of big market and economic
turbulence.
The short-term debt cycles add up to the long-term (big) debt cycles, which I will henceforth call the Big Debt
Cycle.
These cycles move markets and economies around an upward-sloping trend line of rising living standards that is due
to people’s inventiveness and the increases in productivity that come from it. The incline of its upward slope in
productivity is primarily driven by the inventiveness of practical people (e.g., entrepreneurs) who are given adequate
resources (e.g., capital) and work well with others (their coworkers, government officials, lawyers, etc.) to make
productivity improvements.
Over a short period of time (i.e., 1-10 years) the short-term debt cycle is dominant. Over a long period of time (i.e.,
10 years and beyond) the long-term debt cycle and the upward-sloping trend line in productivity have much bigger
effects. Conceptually, the way this dynamic transpires looks like this to me:

Short-term
debt cycles

The Big Debt
Cycle
Productivity

What separates a sustainable debt cycle from an unsustainable one is whether the debt creates enough income
or more to pay for the debt service. If incomes fail to grow as quickly as debt and debt service, the ratio of debts

to incomes will mechanically grow, which will require increased borrowing to serve debt as well as to spend. The
cycle goes from low to high to unsustainably high debt and debt service relative to incomes. A sure sign of moving
toward a debt crisis is when there is a large and rising amount of borrowing that is being used to pay for the debt
service.
Why don’t central bankers do a better job than they have been doing in smoothing out these debt cycles by better
containing debt so it doesn’t reach dangerous levels? There are four reasons:
1) Most everyone, including central bankers, wants the markets and economy to go up because that’s
rewarding and they don’t worry much about the pain of paying back debts, so they push the limits, including
becoming leveraged to long assets until that can’t continue because they have reached the point that debts
are so burdensome they have to be restructured to be reduced relative to incomes.
2) It is not clear exactly what risky debt levels are because it’s not clear what will happen that will determine
future incomes.
3) There are opportunity costs and risks to not providing credit that creates debt.
4) Debt crises, even big ones, can usually be managed to reduce the pain they cause to acceptable levels.
Debt isn’t always bad, even when it’s not economic. Too little credit/debt growth can create economic problems
as bad or worse than too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities. That is because 1)
credit can be used to create great improvements that aren’t profitable that would have been foregone without it
and 2) the losses from the debt problems can be spread out to be not intolerably painful if the government is in
control of the debt restructuring process and the debt is in the currency that the central bank can print. However,
to avoid a debt crisis, debt must raise incomes to service the debts.
Over time, from one cycle to the next, debt liabilities and debt assets have virtually always increased to make the
long-term debt cycle expansion. In virtually all cases that has continued until the debt burdens have become
unsustainably large or the debt assets have become intolerably low-returning.
When there are a lot of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to incomes, it is difficult for central bankers to keep
interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without having them so high that they unacceptably hurt
borrower-debtors, and it is difficult for central banks to run monetary policy to balance growth and inflation well.
And because holders of debt assets want to sell the debt, one way or another debt is going to have a bad return.
That puts central bankers in the position of having to choose between:
1.

2.

Not printing money and buying debt (i.e., not monetizing debt) and letting interest rates rise enough to
cut credit demand and economic activity enough to reach the indifference-equilibrium level that will
balance the buying and selling of the bonds. This will make cash very valuable, devalue most other assets
like stocks and hard assets, cause deflation, lead to debt defaults and restructurings, and depress economic
activity. This typically happens first and is intolerable, which leads to central banks to start…
Printing money and buying debt (i.e., monetizing debt) to make up for the shortfall in demand, which will
make money readily available and reduce its value thus raising inflation, raise the value of most other assets
like stocks and hard assets, minimize debt defaults, and stimulate economic activity. This typically
eventually happens.

At that part of the Big Debt Cycle, there need to be big reductions in debt liabilities and debt assets. These are the
big debt crisis periods. These big debt restructurings and debt monetizations end the prior Big Debt Cycle by reducing
debt burdens and eliminating the prior monetary order, leading to the next new Big Debt Cycle and monetary order.
They take place much like big changes in domestic political orders and big changes in world orders—like seismic
shifts due to the old orders breaking down. There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to reduce the
debt burdens:
1) austerity (i.e., spending less),
2) debt defaults/restructurings,

3) the central bank “printing money” and making purchases (or providing guarantees), and
4) transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less.
Policy makers typically try austerity first because that’s the obvious thing to do, and it’s natural to want to let those
who got themselves and others into trouble bear the costs. This is a big mistake. Austerity doesn’t bring debt and
income back into balance because one person’s debts are another person’s assets. Cutting debts cuts investors’
assets and makes them “poorer,” and because one person’s spending is another person’s income, cutting spending
cuts incomes. For that reason, cuts in debts and spending cause a commensurate cut in net worths and incomes,
which is very painful. Also, as the economy contracts, government revenues typically fall at the same time as
demands on the government increase, which leads deficits to increase. Seeking to be fiscally responsible at this
point, governments tend to raise taxes, which is also a mistake because it further squeezes people and companies.
More simply said, when there is spending that’s greater than revenues and liquid liabilities that are greater than
liquid assets, that produces the need to borrow and sell debt assets, which, if there’s not enough demand, will
produce one kind of crisis (e.g., deflationary) or another (e.g., inflationary).
As touched on earlier, the best way for policy makers to reduce debt burdens without causing a big economic
crisis is to engineer what I call a beautiful deleveraging, which is when policy makers both 1) restructure the debts
so debt service payments are spread out over more time or disposed of (which is deflationary and depressing) and
2) have central banks print money and buy debt (which is inflationary and stimulating). Doing these two things in
balanced amounts spreads out and reduces debt burdens and produces nominal economic growth (inflation plus
real growth) that is greater than nominal interest rates, so debt burdens fall relative to incomes.
If done well, there is a balance between the deflationary and depressing reduction of debt payments and the
inflationary and stimulating printing of money and buying of debt by the central banks. In the countries I studied,
most big debt crises that occurred with the debts denominated in a country’s own currency were restructured
quickly, typically in one to three years. These restructuring periods are periods of great risk and opportunity. If you
want to learn more about these periods and processes, they are explained more completely in Principles for
Navigating Big Debt Crises.

The Big Debt Cycle, Its Risks, and How to Deal with It Need to Be Better Understood
Because the really big debt crises that take the form of debt restructurings and devaluations that come at the
ends of Big Debt Cycles happen roughly once in a lifetime, they are not well understood relative to the short-term
cycles. That is why I did this study. Said differently, what ends long-term debt cycles is different from what ends
short-term debt cycles, so most people don’t know about or acknowledge long-term debt cycles or worry about
long-term debt cycles ending even though they’re much bigger deals than short-term debt cycles ending. That’s
dangerous. It’s like eating fatty foods and having cholesterol accumulate in the heart as plaque and saying that it
doesn’t seem to be causing trouble while it is increasing the probability of a heart attack.
Let’s remember what is healthy, which is 1) having private sector lenders give their credit in exchange for debt that
works well for them and creditors because the uses of the funds were profitable and 2) for government borrowings
to be used in ways that produce productivity gains (e.g., in better infrastructure, education, etc.) that can be paid
for via tax revenue, or for the government to sometimes borrow and spend more than it takes in when the economy
needs stimulation that is followed by paying it back when conditions are strong. And let’s remember what isn’t
healthy, which is 1) the central bank chronically printing money and buying debt to make up for the shortage in
demand for the debt and 2) the central government chronically having large deficits that result in debt and debt
service levels rising faster than the incomes (in the government’s case, tax revenue) that are required to service
them.
In Summary and to Reiterate:
•
•

Goods, services, and investment assets can be produced, bought, and sold with money and credit.
Central banks can produce money and can influence the amount of credit in whatever quantities they want.

•

Borrower-debtors ultimately require enough money and low enough interest rates for them to be able to
borrow and service their debts.
Lender-creditors require high enough interest rates and low enough default rates from the debtors in order
for them to get adequate returns to lend and be creditors.
This balancing act becomes progressively more difficult as the sizes of the debt assets and debt liabilities both
increase relative to the incomes. Eventually they need to be reduced, so a deleveraging happens.
The best type of deleveraging is what I call a beautiful deleveraging, which can be engineered by central
governments and central banks to reduce debt burdens if the debt is in their own currencies. If the debts are
denominated in a foreign currency the deleveraging is quite ugly. I will explain these later.
Over the long term, being productive and having healthy income statements (i.e., earning more than one is
spending) and healthy balance sheets (i.e., having more assets than liabilities) are the markers of financial
health.
If you know where in the credit/debt cycle each country is and how the players are likely to behave, you
should be able to navigate these cycles well.
The past is prologue.

Important Takeaways:
•

Debt crises are inevitable. Throughout history only a very few well-disciplined countries have avoided
debt crises. That’s because lending is never done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle
affects people’s psychology to produce bubbles and busts.

•

Most debt crises, even big ones, can be managed well by economic policy makers if they are well spreadout.

•

All debt crises provide investment opportunities for investors if they understand how they work and have
good principles for navigating them well.

•

Inevitably, at the beginning of the end of the Big Debt Cycle when there is a lot of debt, it is difficult to
keep real interest rates high enough to satisfy lender-creditors without them being too high for borrowerdebtors, and central banks try to navigate between these choices. Typically, during these times, both the
tight-money economic contraction and the loose-money inflation occur, and the only question is in what
order. In any case, owning the debt/currency of overly indebted governments at such times is a bad
investment.

•

Central banks have to choose between keeping money “hard,” which will lead debtors to default on their
debts, which will lead to deflationary depressions, or making money “soft” by printing a lot of it, which
will devalue both it and the debt. Because paying off debt with hard money causes such severe market
and economic downturns, when faced with this choice central banks always eventually choose to print
and devalue money. For the case studies, see Part 2 of Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises. Of course,
each country’s central bank can only print that country’s money, which brings me to my next big point.

•

If debts are denominated in a country’s own currency, its central bank can and will “print” the money to
alleviate the debt crisis. This allows them to manage it better than if they couldn’t print the money, but
of course it also reduces the value of the money.

The Other Four Big Forces Affect How This Debt Cycle Transpires Just as This Debt Cycle Affects How the
Other Four Forces Transpire Together
Thus far, I have just spoken about debt cycles because that is the subject of this study. However, many factors
interact to determine what happens, so I couldn’t ignore them and do my job well. They were covered extensively
in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. While I showed 18 measures of the major drivers
of conditions in the book, the big five that explain almost everything are: 1) the money/credit/debt/markets/
economic cycles, 2) the cycle of social and political order and disorder that takes place within countries, 3) the cycle
of order and disorder that is manifest in the peace and war cycle that takes place between countries, and 4) acts-ofnature shocks such as droughts, floods, and pandemics, and 5) human inventiveness, especially of new technologies
that increase productivity. The interactions between these forces drive how conditions change. They tend to
reinforce each other both upwardly and downwardly. For example, periods of financial and economic crisis raise the
odds of having periods of internal conflict, and periods of internal conflict worsen financial and economic conditions.
Similarly, periods of internal financial problems and internal political conflicts both weaken the country that they are
happening in and, if they are global, increase the likelihood of international conflicts. Together these forces create
the Big Cycles of ups and downs, peace and wars, that occur in countries and between countries, that lead to big
changes in domestic and world orders.
These big rises and declines are easy to see by monitoring the 18 forces (particularly the big five) that I’m sharing
with you. For example, you can see the big evolutionary decline of great powers and their monies reflected in 1)
the unwavering rises of indebtedness accompanied by the steady weakening of the types of monetary systems
used to restrain credit-and-debt-growth-motivated attempts to raise credit and economic growth and 2) the
decline of many indicators of health, such as the quality of education, infrastructure, law and order, civility,
government effectiveness, relative to those other world powers.
I won’t now delve into how all these work—both because doing that would be too much of a digression and because
it’s better explained in my book or even in my relatively brief video, both titled Principles for Dealing with the
Changing World Order. I will now delve into a description of the mechanics of the Big Debt Cycle in numbers and
equations, which I will try to describe in an easy-to-understand way.

Chapter 3: The Mechanics in Numbers and Equations
Warning: This chapter gets into debt mechanics including some simple equations that are helpful in calculating
what is likely to happen related to the limitations of debt. I believe this material will be valuable for professionals
and aspiring professionals and probably beyond the interests of others. I suggest that you give it a scan to grab
the important concepts and then decide if you want to delve deeper into this material.
While in Chapter 2, I described in words how central governments and central banks typically get into financial
trouble, in this chapter I will show numbers and equations that can be used to anticipate these financial troubles,
including a few formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and create problems.
I will start by showing you the key drivers of debt sustainability and how they interact. Before I do, I will lay out
what an “unsustainable” debt burden is. Ultimately, it’s simple: an “unsustainable” debt burden exists when the
amount of money that comes in is less than the money that goes out, either because a) the amount in storage
(i.e., savings) goes down and/or b) the amount borrowed goes up until one runs out of savings and/or one can’t
borrow any more, at which time a debt failure occurs. Think of this money flow as being like a blood flow and think
of income statements and balance sheets as the reports that show it. A healthy condition is when the amount that
comes in from earning is equal to or greater than the amount that goes out from spending and debts don’t build up
faster than incomes. This isn’t to say that debt growth is necessarily bad. If debts build up, but the money borrowed
leads to incomes rising faster than the rate of debt service rises, that will lead to more money coming in than going
out, which will be healthy. When debts grow faster than incomes, think of it like plaque building up in the arteries
because it reduces the amount of income flow that can be used for spending or savings. That is because it leads to
increased debt service payments that reduce the amount of income that can go toward spending. If the money flow
is constrained too much, there is a default, which is the economic equivalent to a heart attack. Interest rates matter
a lot because they influence the amounts that have to be paid a lot. They also influence the willingness of lendercreditors to hold and buy the debt assets and liabilities. As debt service becomes large relative to the amount of
income and savings, a squeeze develops, which is when a debt problem occurs.
We can measure debt burdens in the following ways, and we know that as they become high and/or rise quickly,
the risks of defaults and/or devaluations also become high. While there are about 35 indicators that I look at to
assess debt risks, the four most important indicators are:
1.

Debts relative to income. As debts get larger relative to incomes, all else being equal, the debtor will have
higher interest and rollover payments each year, which will increasingly squeeze down the money that is
left for other spending. There are two problems with high debts relative to income: 1) there is a greater risk
that the large amount of existing debt won’t be rolled over by creditors and 2) it creates higher debt service
payments as a percent of income, which reduces the amount of money that can go to spending, all else
being equal. That brings me to the next measure.

2.

Debt service relative to income. Debt service is the amount a debtor must pay in interest and principal
payments to not default on its debts each year. As total debt service gets higher and higher relative to
income, it will either squeeze out spending or require more borrowing, which will further increase debt
service expenditures. As this happens, it leads investors to expect credit problems ahead and choose not to
lend more and/or to sell the debt assets they already own, which causes credit problems to come about.
To help estimate how debts and debt service will build up, I look at the rate of interest relative to the rate
of income growth.

3.

Nominal interest rates relative to a) inflation rates and b) nominal income growth rates (i.e., inflation
plus real growth). I look at these for two reasons:
a) They show me how debt and debt service are likely to grow relative to incomes. For example, if
someone has debts of 100% of income, the nominal interest rate is 5%, and the nominal income

growth rate is 3%, they will owe about 102% of income next year (assuming their spending is equal
to their income). 16
b) They show me how attractive credit conditions are for lenders relative to borrowers. If nominal
interest rates are high relative to nominal growth rates and inflation rates that is an indicator that
conditions are relatively favorable for lenders and unfavorable for borrowers, which will encourage
lending and discourage borrowing/spending (i.e., it reflects greater risk of debt problems among
more indebted debtors that can’t print money to pay debt). If the reverse is true, conditions are
relatively unfavorable for lender-creditors and favorable for borrower-debtors, which will
encourage borrowing and discourage lending.
4.

Debts and debt service relative to savings (e.g., reserves). If all of the above are not financially healthy but
one has large savings to draw on and draw down, one won’t have a high risk of default because one can
draw on the savings (e.g., reserves) to make debt and spending payments.

Inevitably, equilibrium levels of 1) debts relative to incomes, 2) debt service relative to incomes, 3)
nominal interest rates relative to inflation rates (i.e., real interest rates) and nominal growth rates, and
4) debts and debt service relative to savings will be approached. If you watch these ratios over time, you
will see them go to extreme levels and return to more normal levels one way or another. If you understand
the cause/effect relationships that drive these changes, you can understand how to navigate them and
how they can be best managed. Most importantly, if you understand the painful deleveraging part, you will
understand that it can be handled well (to be less painful) or handled poorly (and be very painful).
These four indicators are not the only ones that matter. In Chapter 4, I’ll show you how a broader set of indicators
evolve through the end of the Big Debt Cycle, and in Chapter 15, I’ll show you what my indicators suggest for the US
today. However, the previously mentioned four are the most important ones to watch. They give us valuable
information about how likely a debt squeeze is and how severe it will be when it happens. However, they cannot tell
us exactly when the debt problem will occur because different conditions and different people’s reactions to them
lead to different lead times for the selling of debt assets and other actions that precipitate a crisis. Still, we can
measure the level of risk because countries with very high debt levels, very large deficits, low savings, and
very high and very fast rising interest rates have a very high risk of a debt default or debt devaluation
crisis.
The rest of this section goes through a few formulaic examples to illustrate how high debt burdens compound and
create problems.

16 If the amount earned is greater than the amount spent excluding the interest payments that is called a primary surplus, and if it is less that is
called a primary deficit.

Measuring Debt Burdens in Numbers
What follows are the mathematical relationships for measuring these indicators. These are just the commonsense
constraints on the amount of debt an entity can have, expressed in equations which are the same constraints that
you can have expressed in words. To help you understand them, you might relate to them the same way you relate
to your own debt constraints. I will explain the rules and include a few helpful rules of thumb. The pages that follow
will explain each of these with examples. Not only can these relationships help one to identify debt problems, but
they can be used to help policy makers see how to fix them and help market participants position themselves
well. Feel free to skip this and come back if it’s more helpful to see examples first and then the math.
1) Future debts relative to future income. The formula to estimate this is:
𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫
=
𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭𝑭 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹

𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹 ∗ (𝟏𝟏 + 𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹)
In words: Future debt relative to revenue is a function of 1) spending more or less than one makes in
revenue, 2) the “compounding” of one’s existing debts, and 3) revenue growth. As one’s expenses grow
relative to one’s revenue, one is forced to borrow more to finance the spending, which increases new
borrowing (first numerator term). As interest rates rise, existing debts grow faster (second numerator
term). As revenues grow, incomes grow relative to debts, so the ratio of debt to revenue falls (denominator
term).

Debt/income is a good indicator of risk because the larger it is, the riskier and the more burdensome the
debt is, all else being equal. For example, the more debt there is, the more risk there is that the debt won’t
be rolled over and the more difficult it is for the central bank to keep interest rates low enough to satisfy
the borrower-debtors without having them too high for the lender-creditor. You can probably already see
that, in addition to the level of debt/income mattering, the interest rate, income growth rate, and primary
deficit (expenses excluding interest versus revenue) matter a lot to how debt burdens evolve.
We can also reconfigure this formula to solve for ways to keep the debt-to-income ratio the same. We will
show a few different examples of this at the end of this chapter.

In words: Future debt service relative to revenue is a function of future interest costs and principal
payments, relative to how much revenue grows. If revenue grows a lot, debt service will fall relative to
incomes, all else equal.
Future interest costs are a function of the debt level and the average interest rate on debt. If interest rates
shoot up, it generally will not immediately make the interest costs for a debtor go up, because on their
longer-term bonds, the interest rate will be locked at the interest rate at the time of issuance. As the bonds
“roll”—i.e., come due and are reissued at the new interest rate, the bonds will gradually get to have higher
interest rates on them, and interest costs will rise.
Principal payments are the amount of debt that is coming due each year that must be paid back, typically
via issuing new debt to pay back the old debt that comes due. A rough way to estimate principal payments
is by calculating the average maturity—or time until debts must be paid back—on existing debts. When
debtors are stressed, creditors typically will not want to lend to them for as long, so we often see the
maturity of debts falling as creditors become more stressed, which means principal payments go up for the
same level of debts.
3) Nominal interest rates relative to a) inflation rates and b) nominal income growth rates (i.e., inflation
plus real growth):
The expected level of nominal interest rates relative to nominal growth rates tells us how debt and debt
service is likely to grow or shrink. Below, we show the formula for the interest rate that would keep debt
levels and interest debt service flat relative to revenue. Note that this is based on the first formula, just
reconfiguring that formula to give us the required interest rate to keep debts flat relative to revenue.

To walk through this in words, if the primary deficit is zero (i.e., current expenses before interest = current
revenue), debts will stay flat if the interest rate is equal to the revenue growth rate. If the primary deficit is
5% of the current debt level, interest rates would need to be 5% below the revenue growth rate.
The intuition here is that if the interest rates are equal to revenue growth, debts will compound at the same
rate that income is growing. If the government is also borrowing, debts need to compound slower than
income, so interest rates need to be below revenue growth rates.
As interest rates rise relative to revenue growth rates, debts will grow relative to incomes because existing
debts will compound faster than revenue is growing, and interest debt service costs will grow even faster
because both the debt level will grow and the interest rate will be rising, and interest costs are the product
of these two inputs. Similarly, as interest rates fall, debt levels will grow less quickly and interest debt service
costs will grow even less or shrink. (This is, for instance, what has happened in Japan over the last 20 years.
I will show this in more detail in Chapter 14).

You can probably see that, just as you can solve for the interest rate required to keep debts flat, you can
also solve for the deficit or surplus required, revenue growth required, and so on. If you flip to the end of
this chapter, I show you what these numbers look like for the US and Japan today.
4) Debts and debt service relative to savings (e.g., reserves): Just as we can estimate debt burdens relative
to income, we can estimate them relative to savings—simply by looking at the level and change in savings
rather than the level and change in incomes. The formula to estimate this is as follows:

These formulas are very similar to (1) and (2), so I will not fully walk through them in words. The difference
is that we are looking at debts and debt service relative to savings. If one has large debts but very large
savings, it is less likely that the debt burdens are concerning, because one can pay the debt service and pay
back part of the debts using the savings. It creates a buffer.
If one is consistently running deficits, and the expected surplus is negative, you can see that debts and debt
service will quickly grow relative to savings, creating a more concerning setup.
A few rules of thumb that help to convey how these equations play out:
•

•
•

If nominal interest rates are at the same level as nominal income growth and a government is running no
primary deficit (i.e., revenue = spending excluding interest), the debts will stay the same relative to the
incomes. But if interest rates are higher than income growth, then the debt burdens of existing debts will
increase. This is probably the single most important variable in our calculation. For example, a bad but
plausible period of nominal interest rates to nominal growth would be interest rates being higher than
income growth by 2%. This would cause the debt-to-income ratio to increase by around 50% over 20 years,
even without primary deficits, leading to more borrowing and debt. This means that if you start with debts
of 50% of income, they’ll go to 75%, but if you start with debts of 400%, they’ll go to 600%.
Debt service expenses accumulating is like plaque in the arteries accumulating in that it squeezes out the
desired flow of nutrients to the economy.
The main effect of high debt levels is making the debtor vulnerable to not being able to roll it forward.

These mathematical relationships can provide us with good estimates of the magnitudes of debt service squeezes
that will occur if the existing levels of debt are rolled over. However, they don’t show the dynamic that happens
when holders of debt assets want to sell the debt they are holding. In this next section I will explain all these things.
Now I will go through a few examples to illustrate how these drivers work and interact with one another.

This equation is inexact because a government could use a surplus to either accumulate reserves/savings or to pay down existing debts,
which would show up via expenses being lower than revenue. Depending on what choice a government made, the surplus could show up as
future debt falling or as future savings increasing. Either way the ratio would improve but the effect would be slightly different based on the
choices of the government.

Example 1: Debts Relative to Incomes (Levels and Changes)
As starting debt levels grow, and as deficits (i.e., borrowings) grow, future debt levels, debt service, and interest
costs all grow. The table below shows a range of outcomes. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which is more commonly
quoted, is not as relevant to the government’s debt service picture as its own debt-to-income ratio. That is because
for any debtor, including central governments, what matters most is the amount of money that goes out (in this
case, in debt service) relative to the amount of money that comes in, because that is what creates the debt
squeeze; the size of GDP is only partially related. 18 Both are only rough indicators of the capacity of the economy to
bear the debt burden.
For reference, the US government’s debt to money coming in (mostly tax income) is, as of this writing, about 580%.
Expenditures excluding interest are projected to average ~115% of income over the next decade, so the primary
deficit—the difference between these—is ~15% of income. 19 The US is also borrowing ~20% of its income each year
to cover interest expenses on the existing debt.
If we assume that interest rates equal income growth but use the actual projected primary deficit for the US (i.e.,
the actual gap between non-interest expenses and income), the US government’s debt-to-income is projected to
rise by about 150%, from 580% to 730% over the next 10 years. This would also lead to a proportional increase in
the interest expense and debt service burden.

The table below shows debt levels 10 years forward for various starting debt levels and deficits. The second table
shows the change relative to the starting debt level. You can see that as the starting debt level rises, and as deficits
become larger, the expected debt level at the end gets higher.

US trajectory today

19
Throughout this study, I am using the CBO’s projections where possible as a baseline estimate. These projections are based on settled law so
they assume that expiring fiscal measures (i.e., the Trump tax cuts) roll off as implemented in current law. If these tax cuts are extended, the
CBO estimates it would represent additional annual spending of 1.3% of GDP or 10.6% of government revenue, which would substantially
worsen the fiscal trajectory versus the CBO’s baseline projection.

When going through these numbers, you might keep in mind that at the time of this writing, the US, Japanese,

Example 2: The Effects of Nominal Interest Rates Minus Nominal Income Growth Rates on Debt-to-Income
Ratios
When interest rates are higher than income growth rates, the existing debt grows relative to incomes because the
debt compounds faster than incomes grow.
The tables below illustrate how this works. Previously, we showed how debt grows for different starting debt levels
and deficits. This time, we are assuming a starting deficit of 35% of income (using the CBO’s projected primary deficit
over the next decade). 20 The rows below are still different starting debt levels. The columns now show the nominal
interest rate minus the nominal income growth rate. The CBO projects that, over the next decade, effective interest
rates will average 3.4% and the US will have 3.8% nominal growth. The difference is -0.4%, so this would leave the
US around the red-boxed area below.

Starting Debt-to-Income

The first table below shows the levels of debt to income 10 years from now based on these assumptions, and the
second table shows the change in debt to income over the 10 years. As interest rates get higher than growth, debt
levels grow faster. Also, as debts get higher, the impact of high interest rates gets worse much faster.

US trajectory today

Previously, we forecast that with current debts and deficits, US debt levels will rise from 580% to 730% of income. If
we also incorporate projected interest rates relative to nominal growth, we’d expect US debt levels to rise to 679%
of income (assuming taxes stay a constant share of GDP). You get the idea.
Since interest rates are projected to be slightly below nominal growth, this adjustment doesn’t change our debt
outlook much for the US today. But you can see that if the central bank wanted to help the central government keep
20

As noted previously, the CBO projections use settled law so they assume that expiring fiscal measures (i.e., the Trump tax cuts) roll off as
implemented in current law. If these tax cuts are extended, the CBO estimates it would represent additional annual spending of 1.3% of GDP or
10.6% of government revenue.

its debt burdens more manageable, it could push interest rates to further below nominal growth by buying the
government bonds, which would cause debt burdens to grow much slower, all else equal. Of course, that wouldn’t
be good for the lender-creditors holding the debt assets because they would get a lower nominal interest rate and
a lower real interest rate than they would have gotten. I suspect that you are beginning to get the picture of how
this dynamic works and has worked in the past—e.g., why central banks created such low nominal rates (near 0%)
and such negative real interest rates by printing money and buying government debt—and what is most likely to
take place in the future if the current path isn’t altered. More specifically, if debt growth remains as projected,
central banks will have to push real interest rates lower, which will make debt assets less attractive for lendercreditors.
In an economy, there are many interrelated drivers that change interdependently. It’s like a Rubik’s Cube, in which
changing one part of the cube—one driver in the grids shown previously—causes changes to the other parts. It gets
complicated to understand how these drivers interrelate and to project scenarios. To help illustrate this, we created
a simple model to walk through one scenario for the next decade.
Let’s start by considering Example 3 below, with a government that has numbers similar to the US government now.
Let’s say nominal income is growing at 3.8% a year, interest rates are 3.4%, and debt levels start at 580% of
government income. In this example, we’ll assume that the government spends 35% more than it collects in income,
including interest payments.

Example 3: Interest Rates Spiral Upward to Keep Buyers in the Debt Assets
Since this government is running a 15% primary deficit (i.e., excluding interest payments), it collects $5.2 trillion in
revenue and spends $6 trillion in Year 1. It must pay $1.1 trillion in interest, because it started with debts at 580% of
government income, and interest rates are about 4%. Let’s assume that about 35% of the existing debt is coming
due this year (which is about how much US government debt matures every year) and will need to be rolled over—
so $10.3 trillion of existing debt will come due this year and will need to be paid back. In total, this government
needs to sell $12.2 trillion of debt in Year 1. What happens if the public is no longer willing to buy this debt, or is
a seller at current interest rates?
Markets must clear, so this means that interest rates will go up until someone is willing to buy these bonds. But as
the interest rates go up, that makes the government’s borrowing even more expensive, meaning the problems get
even worse, creating a greater desire to sell the bonds, which creates even more upward pressure on interest rates.
A spiral of rising interest rates leading to worsening credit risk, leading to less demand for the debt, leading to
higher interest rates is a classic “debt death spiral.” In the table below you can see how this works. In this example,
I show interest rates going up by 0.5% a year while nominal growth stays flat.
If interest rates stayed flat, the government would have ended Year 10 with debts at 679% of income and interest
at 22% of income. Here, relative to income, we end with debts at 898%, interest at 68%, and total debt service
(including principal payments) of 353%. Of course, if interest rates are going up because the debts are
unsustainable, they’ll only go up more as debts rise and become even more unsustainable. And at the same time,
the high interest rates are likely constricting income growth, increasing the challenge of debt sustainability. Of
course, the worst-case scenario is one where a significant additional amount of debt assets is sold (i.e., to fund a war
or social benefits in a recession), which would drive interest rates up a lot more.

A government can prevent this spiral of rising rates by reducing its debt burdens. I laid this out in more detail in
my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, but, to reiterate, there are four ways to reduce debt burdens for
a government:
-

Austerity (i.e., spending less), which doesn’t work because one person’s spending is another’s person’s
earnings, so austerity causes a self-reinforcing deflationary contraction.
Debt defaults/restructurings, which reduce debt burdens and are deflationary because one person’s debts
are another’s assets.
The central bank printing money and making purchases of debt, which reduces debt burdens because it
provides the money to pay the debts and is inflationary.
Transfers of money and credit from private market players who have money to the government via taxes,
which is then transferred to other private market players.

When I looked at historical cases of private debt problems, I typically saw a mix of these levers being pulled, with a
strong bias to print money and buy debt (i.e., monetize debt) when the debt squeeze is big. I also saw the fight over
increased taxes as well as big conflicts between those of the left and those of the right. That all occurs for logical
reasons. When central governments are squeezed, it’s a big deal because central governments are typically the
largest part of the economy and the only part of the economy to pay for large amounts of non-economic social
expenses, which are critically important at such times, when economic conditions are bad. If governments are slow
in providing spending and financial support, it’s likely that that will create a larger economic downturn, which
counterintuitively worsens debt burdens by reducing income growth and net worths and could lead to social turmoil.
As a result, for overly indebted governments to cut their spending to deal with their debt problems at such times is
self-damagingly painful. Then the question is: where does the government get its money from?
The easiest path, though not the best path for the long-term health of the system, is for governments to
resolve their debt problems and spend as they would like to spend by having the central bank print money
and purchase the bonds, thereby holding interest rates down at tolerable levels and putting money into
the system. As a result, that is what they will unfailingly do when the debts are denominated in their own
currencies. Let’s look at an example of how this works.

Example 4: Central Bank Steps in Because Private Players Are Unwilling to Hold the Desired Amount of
Government Bonds to Keep Interest Rates at the Desired Level for Acceptable Economic Growth
Thus far, we looked at how the starting debt-to-income ratio, the income growth rate, the spending growth rate,
the interest rate, and the maturity of the government debt affects future debt burdens. Also, as mentioned, the
demand for the debt matters a lot, and the central bank can, and typically does, print money and buy (i.e., monetize)
debt. Let’s now look at how this last piece works.
There are many factors that determine the private market’s demand for government debt. As previously explained,
these include the expected real return of bonds relative to the projected real returns of other assets, the total
amount of money and credit in the system, the sense of impending risk of a debt/currency crisis, etc.
While these factors are measurable, they are much harder to project than the previously described determinants.
However, they are observable most importantly in the form of either a) interest rates going up while the economy
and the currency are weak (due to the supply/demand imbalance worsening) or b) central banks spending reserves
and/or printing money and creating debt to buy government debt to try to lower real and nominal interest rates by
increasing the demand to eliminate the imbalance. In the next chapter, you will see how this typically happens, and
signals for the transition to the debt/currency crisis.
Before we move on, I wanted to show you how it works for the central bank to step in and absorb excess debt
supply in order to maintain interest rates and liquidity at a desired level. Let’s start with our previous example and
modify it slightly. Let’s assume that in Year 1, the government has $10.3 trillion of debt expiring and is issuing $12
trillion of new debt to replace the expiring bonds, pay interest, and cover spending.
Rather than allowing interest rates to spiral upward to generate sufficient demand for these debt assets, let’s
assume the central bank steps in and buys all the excess issuance, so that the private sector continues to hold no
more than 600% of government income in debt, and interest rates stay flat at 3.4%. In this example, in Year 2, the
central bank will have to buy $0.3 trillion of those debt assets. In subsequent years, these purchases get larger and
larger.
Mechanically, to purchase these debt assets—i.e., monetize the government debt—the central bank prints money
(by creating new reserves/cash) and gives private players that money in exchange for the bonds. This increases the
money supply (M0). In this example, let’s assume that the money supply starts at $5.6 trillion—so 110% of the
starting government income—roughly where it is today in the United States. In our example, as the central bank
prints more and more to cover government shortfalls, the money supply balloons.

This is a rough example, but you can see the general contours of how this works for real economies. As an economy
needs lower and lower interest rates to keep debt burdens manageable, there is less and less private demand for
the debt at those lower interest rates, which requires the central bank to step in. The more the central bank steps
in, the more it is forced to increase the money supply, which devalues money and makes holding debt less
desirable.
That is because, all else being equal, central bank money and credit creation lowers the value of money, which
increases inflation and currency weakness. The relationship is not precise and depends on how exactly the printed
money is transmitted through the economy. Lowering interest rates and increasing the supply of money lowers the
attractiveness of the currency, which makes holding the debt denominated in that currency unattractive.
In the tables below, I wanted to give you a sense of how much money gets printed and how it affects the currency.

This range
corresponds to the
example above

Starting Debt-to-Income

In the first table, the rows represent different starting debt-to-income levels for a government, and the columns
represent how many bonds private players are willing to purchase at current interest rates. As a government has
more of a debt problem, and as private players are willing to hold less of the debt, the money stock increases
more. The red box reflects the scenario laid out above, where the central bank buys $7.7 trillion of bonds, increasing
the money stock from $5.6 trillion to $13.5 trillion.

Buying up bonds and increasing the money supply is stimulative and puts downward pressure on the
currency in two ways:
Mechanically, pushing down interest rates usually causes the currency to sell off. Why? To spell out the mechanics:
•
•
•

Usually, all else equal, lowering an interest rate won’t change investors’ long-term expectations of the value
of a currency. The 10-year forward currency doesn’t move as much.
If you are getting less interest in the meantime because interest rates fell, the new deal is strictly worse.
The way to make the new deal fair again is for the spot currency to fall. That way, you’ll earn more through
currency appreciation (as it reaches the same expected 10-year forward point) to make up for less in
interest.

My next point will be too technical for some and helpfully technical for others, so if you want to skip the technical
stuff, skip it. Mechanically, pushing down interest rates pushes up the currency forward—e.g., a rise in one country’s
10-year sovereign, risk-free bond yield relative to another country’s 10-year risk-free bond yield will raise the 10year forward currency—so if the value to investors of the currency in the 10-year future were to stay the same, the
spot currency would have to sell off by the present value of the 10-year interest rate differences to keep the 10-year
currency forward flat. Said more precisely and more simply: as explained in Chapter 1, the difference in sovereign
interest rates in two countries will be offset by the forward currency premium—e.g., if the interest rate in Country
A is 2% above the interest rate in Country B, then the forward currency of Country A will be at a 2% per year annual
discount to Country B, so if interest rates in Country A were lowered by 1% from that level and the forward currency
stays the same, the currency would weaken by a corresponding amount.
Also, the printed money can directly flow out of the currency, creating a selling pressure in the currency. That is, as
a central bank buys bonds and gives other players cash, there is a chance that they use that cash to buy other
currencies, rather than holding it or buying assets/spending in the same economy.
In the next table, we show a range of outcomes for how this might work. The columns again reflect different
willingness to lend by private players (as you go to the right, private players are less willing to lend to the
government). The rows reflect how sensitive the currency is to the money supply. As the market sees a currency as
a worse and worse store of value, we’d expect the currency to become more sensitive to the money supply, because
other players will be less willing to hold it. For example, let’s assume that printing 1% of GDP in money led to ~1%
currency weakness, then in the example above, we’d expect a ~15% currency depreciation. As the currency becomes
more sensitive to the amount of money (i.e., M0), and as the private sector becomes less willing to lend, we’d
expect to see more and more currency weakness.

What level of interest rates can make debt burdens affordable for a country?
In these examples, we looked at how debts can compound to become unsustainable. I also wanted to show you the
numbers around how debts can be managed sustainably.

In countries that have a lot of debt and high deficits, debts and debt service costs will be a big issue and how much
they will increase over time will be determined by the interest rate relative to income growth and inflation, as shown
in our calculations. A central bank can prevent debt service costs from rising or cause them to decrease relative to
inflation and incomes by pushing down nominal interest rates below nominal growth rates. What I am referring to
are the impacts these things will have on the central governments and the central bank’s financial conditions. Of
course, they will also have a ripple effect on all parts of the economy, but let’s skip that for now.
Given that, we can look at a government’s debt level and projected deficit and calculate what interest rate will be
needed to produce any specified level of debt and debt service relative to incomes—e.g., to keep the debt burden
the same, to have it decline, etc.—given estimates of future revenue and expenses.
If I were setting policy for the Fed, I would want to look at what the deficit and debt levels are and likely will be and
set an interest rate so that debt burdens won't become too great over time. For example, I would probably want to
look at what interest rate would keep debt service payments the same. That would affect my interest rate policy.
I would also want to calculate what level of interest rate would be needed for my central bank not to have big losses
on my balance sheet.
Let's look at these things and also look at how they would have worked in the past.

Formula For Determining Future Debt Burdens
As a reminder, the equation below shows the drivers of future levels of debt and debt service relative to incomes.
This is more fully explained at the start of this chapter.

In the table below, I use this formula to estimate what interest rates would stabilize debt burdens relative to
incomes for the US today. We also show how each of the other available “levers” would have to change in order
to stabilize debt burdens. You can see that to stabilize government debt burdens, the US would either need to see
nominal interest fall to about 1%, see nominal economic growth average about 6% (2.5% additional inflation
above the 3.8% nominal growth projected by the CBO), or raise government revenue (i.e., raising taxes) by 11%.
Of course, each one of these paths would be intolerably too large so it will take the right combination of lesser
amounts of these to successfully achieve the goal. In Chapter 16, “My 3% Solution: How the US Could Stabilize Its
Debt Burden,” I show what I believe the best combinations would be to achieve the goal of limiting debt burdens
and risks in a very tolerable way.

Introduction
I am writing this on the tenth anniversary of the 2008 financial crisis in order to offer the perspective of an
investor who navigated that crisis well because I had developed a template for understanding how all debt crises
work. I am sharing that template here in the hope of reducing the likelihood of future debt crises and helping
them be better managed.
As an investor, my perspective is different from that of most economists and policy makers because I bet on
economic changes via the markets that reflect them, which forces me to focus on the relative values and flows
that drive the movements of capital. Those, in turn, drive these cycles. In the process of trying to navigate them,
I’ve found there is nothing like the pain of being wrong or the pleasure of being right as a global macro investor
to provide the practical lessons about economics that are unavailable in textbooks.
After repeatedly being bit by events I never encountered before, I was driven to go beyond my own personal
experiences to examine all the big economic and market movements in history, and to do that in a way that
would make them virtual experiences—i.e., so that they would show up to me as though I was experiencing them
in real time. That way I would have to place my market bets as if I only knew what happened up until that
moment. I did that by studying historical cases chronologically and in great detail, experiencing them day by day
and month by month. This gave me a much broader and deeper perspective than if I had limited my perspective
to my own direct experiences. Through my own experience, I went through the erosion and eventual breakdown
of the global monetary system (“Bretton Woods”) in 1966–1971, the inflation bubble of the 1970s and its bursting
in 1978–82, the Latin American inflationary depression of the 1980s, the Japanese bubble of the late 1980s and its
bursting in 1988–1991, the global debt bubbles that led to the “tech bubble” bursting in 2000, and the Great
Deleveraging of 2008. And through studying history, I experienced the collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth
century, the United States debt restructuring in 1789, Germany’s Weimar Republic in the 1920s, the global Great
Depression and war that engulfed many countries in the 1930–45 period, and many other crises.
My curiosity and need to know how these things work in order to survive them in the future drove me to try to
understand the cause-effect relationships behind them. I found that by examining many cases of each type of
economic phenomenon (e.g., business cycles, deleveragings) and plotting the averages of each, I could better
visualize and examine the cause-effect relationships of each type. That led me to create templates or archetypal
models of each type—e.g., the archetypal business cycle, the archetypal big debt cycle, the archetypal deflationary deleveraging, the archetypal inflationary deleveraging, etc. Then, by noting the differences of each case
within a type (e.g., each business cycle in relation to the archetypal business cycle), I could see what caused the
differences. By stitching these templates together, I gained a simplified yet deep understanding of all these cases.
Rather than seeing lots of individual things happening, I saw fewer things happening over and over again, like an
experienced doctor who sees each case of a certain type of disease unfolding as “another one of those.”
I did the research and developed this template with the help of many great partners at Bridgewater Associates. This
template allowed us to prepare better for storms that had never happened to us before, just as one who studies
100-year floods or plagues can more easily see them coming and be better prepared. We used our understanding to
build computer decision-making systems that laid out in detail exactly how we’d react to virtually every possible
occurrence. This approach helped us enormously. For example, eight years before the financial crisis of 2008, we
built a “depression gauge” that was programmed to respond to the developments of 2007–2008, which had not
occurred since 1929–32. This allowed us to do very well when most everyone else did badly.

While I won’t get into Bridgewater’s detailed decision making systems, in this study I will share the following:
1) my template for the “Archetypal Big Debt Cycle,” 2) “Three Iconic Case Studies” examined in detail (the US in
2007–2011, which includes the “Great Recession”; the US in 1928–1937, which covers a deflationary depression;
and Germany in 1918–1924, which examines an inflationary depression), and 3) a “Compendium of 48 Case
Studies,” which includes most of the big debt crises that happened over the last 100 years.* I guarantee that if you
take the trouble to understand each of these three perspectives, you will see big debt crises very differently than
you did before.
To me, watching the economy and markets, or just about anything else, on a day-to-day basis is like being in an
evolving snowstorm with millions of bits and pieces of information coming at me that I have to synthesize and
react to well. To see what I mean by being in the blizzard versus seeing what’s happening in more synthesized
ways, compare what’s conveyed in Part 1 (the most synthesized/template version) with Part 2 (the most granular
version), and Part 3 (the version that shows the 48 cases in chart form). If you do that, you will note how all of
these cases transpire in essentially the same way as described in the archetypal case while also noting their
differences, which will prompt you to ponder why these differences exist and how to explain them, which will
advance your understanding. That way, when the next crisis comes along, you will be better prepared to deal
with it.
To be clear, I appreciate that different people have different perspectives, that mine is just one, and that by putting
our perspectives out there for debate we can all advance our understandings. I am sharing this study to do just that.

Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle
How I Think about Credit and Debt
Since we are going to use the terms “credit” and “debt” a lot, I’d like to start with what they are and how they work.
Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back,
which is debt. Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good
thing, and not providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing. For example, if there is
very little credit provided for development, then there is very little development, which is a bad thing. The
problem with debt arises when there is an inability to pay it back. Said differently, the question of whether
rapid credit/debt growth is a good or bad thing hinges on what that credit produces and how the debt is
repaid (i.e., how the debt is serviced).
Almost by definition, financially responsible people don’t like having much debt. I understand that perspective
well because I share it.1 For my whole life, even when I didn’t have any money, I strongly preferred saving to
borrowing, because I felt that the upsides of debt weren’t worth its downsides, which is a perspective I presume I
got from my dad. I identify with people who believe that taking on a little debt is better than taking on a lot. But
over time I learned that that’s not necessarily true, especially for society as a whole (as distinct from individuals),
because those who make policy for society have controls that individuals don’t. From my experiences and my
research, I have learned that too little credit/debt growth can create as bad or worse economic problems
as having too much, with the costs coming in the form of foregone opportunities.
Generally speaking, because credit creates both spending power and debt, whether or not more credit is
desirable depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient
income to service the debt. If that occurs, the resources will have been well allocated and both the lender and
the borrower will benefit economically. If that doesn’t occur, the borrowers and the lenders won’t be satisfied and
there’s a good chance that the resources were poorly allocated.
In assessing this for society as a whole, one should consider the secondary/indirect economics as well as the
more primary/direct economics. For example, sometimes not enough money/credit is provided for such obviously
cost-effective things as educating our children well (which would make them more productive, while reducing
crime and the costs of incarceration), or replacing inefficient infrastructure, because of a fiscal conservativism
that insists that borrowing to do such things is bad for society, which is not true.
I want to be clear that credit/debt that produces enough economic benefit to pay for itself is a good thing. But
sometimes the trade-offs are harder to see. If lending standards are so tight that they require a near certainty of
being paid back, that may lead to fewer debt problems but too little development. If the lending standards are
looser, that could lead to more development but could also create serious debt problems down the road that erase
the benefits. Let’s look at this and a few other common questions about debt and debt cycles.
How Costly Is Bad Debt Relative to Not Having the Spending That the Debt Is Financing?
Suppose that you, as a policy maker, choose to build a subway system that costs $1 billion. You finance it with
debt that you expect to be paid back from revenue, but the economics turn out to be so much worse than you
expected that only half of the expected revenues come in. The debt has to be written down by 50 percent. Does
that mean you shouldn’t have built the subway?
Rephrased, the question is whether the subway system is worth $500 million more than what was initially
budgeted, or, on an annual basis, whether it is worth about 2 percent more per year than budgeted, supposing the
subway system has a 25-year lifespan. Looked at this way, you may well assess that having the subway system at
that cost is a lot better than not having the subway system.

I’m so debt adverse that I’ve hardly had any debt in any form, even when I bought my first house. When I built Bridgewater, it was without debt, and I’m still a keen saver.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises

To give you an idea of what that might mean for an economy as a whole, really bad debt losses have been when
roughly 40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. Those bad loans amount to about 20 percent of all the
outstanding loans, so the losses are equal to about 8 percent of total debt. That total debt, in turn, is equal to
about 200 percent of income (e.g., GDP), so the shortfall is roughly equal to 16 percent of GDP. If that cost is
“socialized” (i.e., borne by the society as a whole via fiscal and/or monetary policies) and spread over 15 years, it
would amount to about 1 percent per year, which is tolerable. Of course, if not spread out, the costs would be
intolerable. For that reason, I am asserting that the downside risks of having a significant amount of debt
depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from
bad debts. I have seen this in all the cases I have lived through and studied. Whether policy makers can
do this depends on two factors: 1) whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control
and 2) whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.
Are Debt Crises Inevitable?
Throughout history only a few well-disciplined countries have avoided debt crises. That’s because lending is
never done perfectly and is often done badly due to how the cycle affects people’s psychology to produce bubbles
and busts. While policy makers generally try to get it right, more often than not they err on the side of being too
loose with credit because the near-term rewards (faster growth) seem to justify it. It is also politically easier to
allow easy credit (e.g., by providing guarantees, easing monetary policies) than to have tight credit. That is the
main reason we see big debt cycles.
Why Do Debt Crises Come in Cycles?
I find that whenever I start talking about cycles, particularly big, long-term cycles, people’s eyebrows go up; the
reactions I elicit are similar to those I’d expect if I were talking about astrology. For that reason, I want to
emphasize that I am talking about nothing more than logically-driven series of events that recur in patterns. In a
market-based economy, expansions and contractions in credit drive economic cycles, which occur for perfectly
logical reasons. Though the patterns are similar, the sequences are neither pre-destined to repeat in exactly the
same ways nor to take exactly the same amount of time.
To put these complicated matters into very simple terms, you create a cycle virtually anytime you borrow money.
Buying something you can’t afford means spending more than you make. You’re not just borrowing from your
lender; you are borrowing from your future self. Essentially, you are creating a time in the future in which you
will need to spend less than you make so you can pay it back. The pattern of borrowing, spending more than you
make, and then having to spend less than you make very quickly resembles a cycle. This is as true for a national
economy as it is for an individual. Borrowing money sets a mechanical, predictable series of events into motion.
If you understand the game of Monopoly®, you can pretty well understand how credit cycles work on the level of
a whole economy. Early in the game, people have a lot of cash and only a few properties, so it pays to convert your
cash into property. As the game progresses and players acquire more and more houses and hotels, more and more
cash is needed to pay the rents that are charged when you land on a property that has a lot of them. Some players
are forced to sell their property at discounted prices to raise that cash. So early in the game, “property is king”
and later in the game, “cash is king.” Those who play the game best understand how to hold the right mix of
property and cash as the game progresses.
Now, let’s imagine how this Monopoly® game would work if we allowed the bank to make loans and take deposits. Players would be able to borrow money to buy property, and, rather than holding their cash idly, they would
deposit it at the bank to earn interest, which in turn would provide the bank with more money to lend. Let’s also
imagine that players in this game could buy and sell properties from each other on credit (i.e., by promising to
pay back the money with interest at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it would provide an almost
perfect model for the way our economy operates. The amount of debt-financed spending on hotels would quickly
grow to multiples of the amount of money in existence. Down the road, the debtors who hold those hotels will
become short on the cash they need to pay their rents and service their debt. The bank will also get into trouble
as their depositors’ rising need for cash will cause them to withdraw it, even as more and more debtors are

10 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

falling behind on their payments. If nothing is done to intervene, both banks and debtors will go broke and the
economy will contract. Over time, as these cycles of expansion and contraction occur repeatedly, the conditions
are created for a big, long-term debt crisis.
Lending naturally creates self-reinforcing upward movements that eventually reverse to create self-reinforcing
downward movements that must reverse in turn. During the upswings, lending supports spending and investment, which in turn supports incomes and asset prices; increased incomes and asset prices support further
borrowing and spending on goods and financial assets. The borrowing essentially lifts spending and incomes
above the consistent productivity growth of the economy. Near the peak of the upward cycle, lending is based on
the expectation that the above-trend growth will continue indefinitely. But, of course, that can’t happen; eventually income will fall below the cost of the loans.
Economies whose growth is significantly supported by debt-financed building of fixed investments, real estate,
and infrastructure are particularly susceptible to large cyclical swings because the fast rates of building those
long-lived assets are not sustainable. If you need better housing and you build it, the incremental need to build
more housing naturally declines. As spending on housing slows down, so does housing’s impact on growth. Let’s
say you have been spending $10 million a year to build an office building (hiring workers, buying steel and
concrete, etc.). When the building is finished, the spending will fall to $0 per year, as will the demand for
workers and construction materials. From that point forward, growth, income, and the ability to service debt will
depend on other demand. This type of cycle—where a strong growth upswing driven by debt-financed real estate,
fixed investment, and infrastructure spending is followed by a downswing driven by a debt-challenged slowdown
in demand—is very typical of emerging economies because they have so much building to do.
Contributing further to the cyclicality of emerging countries’ economies are changes in their competitiveness due
to relative changes in their incomes. Typically, they have very cheap labor and bad infrastructure, so they build
infrastructure, have an export boom, and experience rising incomes. But the rate of growth due to exports
naturally slows as their income levels rise and their wage competitiveness relative to other countries declines.
There are many examples of these kinds of cycles (i.e., Japan’s experience over the last 70 years).
In “bubbles,” the unrealistic expectations and reckless lending results in a critical mass of bad loans. At one stage
or another, this becomes apparent to bankers and central bankers and the bubble begins to deflate. One classic
warning sign that a bubble is coming is when an increasing amount of money is being borrowed to make debt
service payments, which of course compounds the borrowers’ indebtedness.
When money and credit growth are curtailed and/or higher lending standards are imposed, the rates of credit
growth and spending slow and more debt service problems emerge. At this point, the top of the upward phase
of the debt cycle is at hand. Realizing that credit growth is dangerously fast, the central banks tighten monetary
policy to contain it, which often accelerates the decline (though it would have happened anyway, just a bit later).
In either case, when the costs of debt service become greater than the amount that can be borrowed to finance
spending, the upward cycle reverses. Not only does new lending slow down, but the pressure on debtors to make
their payments is increased. The clearer it becomes that debtors are struggling, the less new lending there is.
The slowdown in spending and investment that results slows down income growth even further, and asset
prices decline.
When borrowers cannot meet their debt service obligations to lending institutions, those lending institutions
cannot meet their obligations to their own creditors. Policy makers must handle this by dealing with the lending
institutions first. The most extreme pressures are typically experienced by the lenders that are the most highly
leveraged and that have the most concentrated exposures to failed borrowers. These lenders pose the biggest
risks of creating knock-on effects for credit worthy buyers and across the economy. Typically, they are banks, but
as credit systems have grown more dynamic, a broader set of lenders has emerged, such as insurance companies,
non-bank trusts, broker-dealers, and even special purpose vehicles.

The two main long-term problems that emerge from these kinds of debt cycles are:
1)

The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made. When promised debt
service payments can’t be made, that can lead to either smaller periodic payments and/or the writing
down of the value of the debt (i.e., agreeing to accept less than was owed.) If you were expecting an annual
debt service payment of 4 percent and it comes in at 2 percent or 0 percent, there is that shortfall for each
year, whereas if the debt is marked down, that year’s loss would be much bigger (e.g., 50 percent).

2) The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward. Even after a debt crisis is
resolved, it is unlikely that the entities that borrowed too much can generate the same level of spending in
the future that they had before the crisis. That has implications that must be considered.
Can Most Debt Crises Be Managed so There Aren’t Big Problems?
Sometimes these cycles are moderate, like bumps in the road, and sometimes they are extreme, ending in crashes.
In this study we examine ones that are extreme—i.e., all those in the last 100 years that produced declines in real
GDP of more than 3 percent. Based on my examinations of them and the ways the levers available to policy makers
work, I believe that it is possible for policy makers to manage them well in almost every case that the debts are
denominated in a country’s own currency. That is because the flexibility that policy makers have allows them to
spread out the harmful consequences in such ways that big debt problems aren’t really big problems. Most of the
really terrible economic problems that debt crises have caused occurred before policy makers took steps to spread
them out. Even the biggest debt crises in history (e.g., the 1930s Great Depression) were gotten past once the right
adjustments were made. From my examination of these cases, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves
but from a) the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority,
and b) the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. It is
from a desire to help reduce these risks that I have written this study.
Having said that, I want to reiterate that 1) when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather
than one’s own currency, it is much harder for a country’s policy makers to do the sorts of things that
spread out the debt problems, and 2) the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that
they are not extremely costly to some people.
The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers’ knowing how to use their levers well and
having the authority that they need to do so, knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be
spread out, and who will benefit and who will suffer and in what degree, so that the political and other
consequences are acceptable.
There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to
the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them:
1)

Austerity (i.e., spending less)

2) Debt defaults/restructurings
3) The central bank “printing money” and making purchases (or providing guarantees)
4) Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less
Each one of their levers has different impacts on the economy. Some are inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g.,
“printing money”), while others are deflationary and help reduce debt burdens (e.g., austerity and defaults). The
key to creating a “beautiful deleveraging” (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation
and growth rates, which I explain later) lies in striking the right balance between them. In this happy scenario,
debt-to-income ratios decline at the same time that economic activity and financial asset prices improve, gradually bringing the nominal growth rate of incomes back above the nominal interest rate.
These levers shift around who benefits and who suffers, and over what amount of time. Policy makers are put in
the politically difficult position of having to make those choices. As a result, they are rarely appreciated, even
when they handle the debt crisis well.

Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle
The template that follows is based on my examination of 48 big debt cycles, which include all of the cases that led
to real GDP falling by more than 3 percent in large countries (which is what I will call a depression). For clarity, I
divided the affected countries into two groups: 1) Those that didn’t have much of their debt denominated in
foreign currency and that didn’t experience inflationary depressions, and 2) those that had a significant amount
of their debt denominated in foreign currency and did experience inflationary depressions. Since there was about
a 75 percent correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of inflation that they
experienced (which is not surprising, since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign currency was a
cause of their depressions being inflationary), it made sense to group those that had more foreign currency debt
with those that had inflationary depressions.
Typically debt crises occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes that are needed to
service them, causing a deleveraging. While the central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering real
and nominal interest rates, severe debt crises (i.e., depressions) occur when this is no longer possible. Classically,
a lot of short-term debt cycles (i.e., business cycles) add up to a long-term debt cycle, because each short-term
cyclical high and each short-term cyclical low is higher in its debt-to-income ratio than the one before it, until
the interest rate reductions that helped fuel the expansion in debt can no longer continue. The chart below shows
the debt and debt service burden (both principal and interest) in the US since 1910. You will note how the
interest payments remain flat or go down even when the debt goes up, so that the rise in debt service costs is not
as great as the rise in debt. That is because the central bank (in this case, the Federal Reserve) lowers interest
rates to keep the debt-financed expansion going until they can’t do it any more (because the interest rate hits 0
percent). When that happens, the deleveraging begins.
While the chart gives a good general picture, I should make clear that it is inadequate in two respects: 1) it
doesn’t convey the differences between the various entities that make up these total numbers, which are very
important to understand, and 2) it just shows what is called debt, so it doesn’t reflect liabilities such as pension
and health care obligations, which are much larger. Having this more granular perspective is very important in
gauging a country’s vulnerabilities, though for the most part such issues are beyond the scope of this book.

Our Examination of the Cycle
In developing the template, we will focus on the period leading up to the depression, the depression period itself,
and the deleveraging period that follows the bottom of the depression. As there are two broad types of big debt
crises—deflationary ones and inflationary ones (largely depending on whether a country has a lot of foreign
currency debt or not)—we will examine them separately.
The statistics reflected in the charts of the phases were derived by averaging 21 deflationary debt cycle cases and
27 inflationary debt cycle cases, starting five years before the bottom of the depression and continuing for seven
years after it.

Notably long-term debt cycles appear similar in many ways to short-term debt cycles, except that they are more
extreme, both because the debt burdens are higher and the monetary policies that can address them are less
effective. For the most part, short-term debt cycles produce bumps—mini-booms and recessions—while big
long-term ones produce big booms and busts. Over the last century, the US has gone through a long-term debt
crisis twice—once during the boom of the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s, and again during the
boom of the early 2000s and the financial crisis starting in 2008.
In the short-term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide
and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily
available, there’s a recession. The availability of credit is controlled primarily by the central bank. The central
bank is generally able to bring the economy out of a recession by easing rates to stimulate the cycle anew. But
over time, each bottom and top of the cycle finishes with more economic activity than the previous cycle, and
with more debt. Why? Because people push it—they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of
paying back debt. It’s human nature. As a result, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes. This
creates the long-term debt cycle.
During the upswing of the long-term debt cycle, lenders extend credit freely even as people become more
indebted. That’s because the process is self-reinforcing on the upside—rising spending generates rising incomes
and rising net worths, which raises borrowers’ capacities to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc.
Most everyone is willing to take on more risk. Quite often new types of financial intermediaries and new types of
financial instruments develop that are outside the supervision and protection of regulatory authorities. That puts
them in a competitively attractive position to offer higher returns, take on more leverage, and make loans that
have greater liquidity or credit risk. With credit plentiful, borrowers typically spend more than is sustainable,
giving them the appearance of being prosperous. In turn, lenders, who are enjoying the good times, are more
complacent than they should be. But debts can’t continue to rise faster than the money and income that is
necessary to service them forever, so they are headed toward a debt problem.
When the limits of debt growth relative to income growth are reached, the process works in reverse. Asset prices
fall, debtors have problems servicing their debts, and investors get scared and cautious, which leads them to sell,
or not roll over, their loans. This, in turn, leads to liquidity problems, which means that people cut back on their
spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, incomes begin to go down, which makes
people even less creditworthy. Asset prices fall, further squeezing banks, while debt repayments continue to rise,
making spending drop even further. The stock market crashes and social tensions rise along with unemployment,
as credit and cash-starved companies reduce their expenses. The whole thing starts to feed on itself the other
way, becoming a vicious, self-reinforcing contraction that’s not easily corrected. Debt burdens have simply
become too big and need to be reduced. Unlike in recessions, when monetary policies can be eased by lowering
interest rates and increasing liquidity, which in turn increase the capacities and incentives to lend, interest rates
can’t be lowered in depressions. They are already at or near zero and liquidity/money can’t be increased by
ordinary measures.
This is the dynamic that creates long-term debt cycles. It has existed for as long as there has been credit, going
back to before Roman times. Even the Old Testament described the need to wipe out debt once every 50 years,
which was called the Year of Jubilee. Like most dramas, this one both arises and transpires in ways that have
reoccurred throughout history.
Remember that money serves two purposes: it is a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. And because
it has two purposes, it serves two masters: 1) those who want to obtain it for “life’s necessities,” usually by
working for it, and 2) those who have stored wealth tied to its value. Throughout history these two groups have
been called different things—e.g., the first group has been called workers, the proletariat, and “the have-nots,”
and the second group has been called capitalists, investors, and “the haves.” For simplicity, we will call the first
group proletariat-workers and the second group capitalists-investors. Proletariat-workers earn their money by
selling their time and capitalists-investors earn their money by “lending” others the use of their money in
exchange for either a) a promise to repay an amount of money that is greater than the loan (which is a debt
instrument), or b) a piece of ownership in the business (which we call “equity” or “stocks”) or a piece of another
14 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

asset (e.g., real estate). These two groups, along with the government (which sets the rules), are the major players
in this drama. While generally both groups benefit from borrowing and lending, sometimes one gains and one
suffers as a result of the transaction. This is especially true for debtors and creditors.
One person’s financial assets are another’s financial liabilities (i.e., promises to deliver money). When the claims
on financial assets are too high relative to the money available to meet them, a big deleveraging must occur. Then
the free-market credit system that finances spending ceases to work well, and typically works in reverse via a
deleveraging, necessitating the government to intervene in a big way as the central bank becomes a big buyer of
debt (i.e., lender of last resort) and the central government becomes a redistributor of spending and wealth. At
such times, there needs to be a debt restructuring in which claims on future spending (i.e., debt) are reduced
relative to what they are claims on (i.e., money).
This fundamental imbalance between the size of the claims on money (debt) and the supply of money (i.e., the
cash flow that is needed to service the debt) has occurred many times in history and has always been resolved
via some combination of the four levers I previously described. The process is painful for all of the players,
sometimes so much so that it causes a battle between the proletariat-workers and the capitalists-investors. It can
get so bad that lending is impaired or even outlawed. Historians say that the problems that arose from credit
creation were why usury (lending money for interest) was considered a sin in both Catholicism and Islam.2
In this study we will examine big debt cycles that produce big debt crises, exploring how they work and how to
deal with them well. But before we begin, I want to clarify the differences between the two main types: deflationary and inflationary depressions.
••

In deflationary depressions, policy makers respond to the initial economic contraction by lowering interest
rates. But when interest rates reach about 0 percent, that lever is no longer an effective way to stimulate
the economy. Debt restructuring and austerity dominate, without being balanced by adequate stimulation
(especially money printing and currency depreciation). In this phase, debt burdens (debt and debt service
as a percent of income) rise, because incomes fall faster than restructuring, debt paydowns reduce the
debt stock, and many borrowers are required to rack up still more debts to cover those higher interest
costs. As noted, deflationary depressions typically occur in countries where most of the unsustainable
debt was financed domestically in local currency, so that the eventual debt bust produces forced selling
and defaults, but not a currency or a balance of payments problem.

••

Inflationary depressions classically occur in countries that are reliant on foreign capital flows and so have
built up a significant amount of debt denominated in foreign currency that can’t be monetized (i.e., bought
by money printed by the central bank). When those foreign capital flows slow, credit creation turns into
credit contraction. In an inflationary deleveraging, capital withdrawal dries up lending and liquidity at
the same time that currency declines produce inflation. Inflationary depressions in which a lot of debt
is denominated in foreign currency are especially difficult to manage because policy makers’ abilities to
spread out the pain are more limited.

We will begin with deflationary depressions.

T hroughout the Middle Ages, Christians could generally not legally charge interest to other Christians. This is one reason why Jews played a large part in the development of trade, as they
lent money for business ventures and financed voyages. But Jews were also the holders of the loans that debtors sometimes could not repay. Many historical instances of violence against
Jews were driven by debt crises.

The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
The chart below illustrates the seven stages of an archetypal long-term debt cycle, by tracking the total debt of
the economy as a percentage of the total income of the economy (GDP) and the total amount of debt service
payments relative to GDP over a period of 12 years.

Throughout this section, I’ll include similar “archetype” charts that are built by averaging the deflationary
deleveraging cases.3

1) The Early Part of the Cycle
In the early part of the cycle, debt is not growing faster than incomes, even though debt growth is strong. That is
because debt growth is being used to finance activities that produce fast income growth. For instance, borrowed
money may go toward expanding a business and making it more productive, supporting growth in revenues. Debt
burdens are low and balance sheets are healthy, so there is plenty of room for the private sector, government, and
banks to lever up. Debt growth, economic growth, and inflation are neither too hot nor too cold. This is what is
called the “Goldilocks” period.

2) The Bubble
In the first stage of the bubble, debts rise faster than incomes, and they produce accelerating strong asset returns
and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because rising incomes, net-worths, and asset values raise
borrowers’ capacities to borrow. This happens because lenders determine how much they can lend on the basis of
the borrowers’ 1) projected income/cash flows to service the debt, 2) net worth/collateral (which rises as asset
prices rise), and 3) their own capacities to lend. All of these rise together. Though this set of conditions is not
sustainable because the debt growth rates are increasing faster than the incomes that will be required to service
them, borrowers feel rich, so they spend more than they earn and buy assets at high prices with leverage. Here’s
one example of how that happens:
Suppose you earn $50,000 a year and have a net worth of $50,000. You have the capacity to borrow $10,000 per
year, so you could spend $60,000 per year for a number of years, even though you only earn $50,000. For an
economy as a whole, increased borrowing and spending can lead to higher incomes, and rising stock valuations
and other asset values, giving people more collateral to borrow against. People then borrow more and more, but
as long as the borrowing drives growth, it is affordable.

Archetype charts are sensitive to outliers, especially for metrics like inflation that vary widely. For each chart, we excluded roughly the third of cases that were least related to the average.

16 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

In this up-wave part of the long-term debt cycle, promises to deliver money (i.e., debt burdens) rise relative to
both the supply of money in the overall economy and the amount of money and credit debtors have coming in
(via incomes, borrowing, and sales of assets). This up-wave typically goes on for decades, with variations primarily due to central banks’ periodic tightenings and easings of credit. These are short-term debt cycles, and a bunch
of them generally add up to a long-term debt cycle.
A key reason the long-term debt cycle can be sustained for so long is that central banks progressively lower
interest rates, which raises asset prices and, in turn, people’s wealth, because of the present value effect that
lowering interest rates has on asset prices. This keeps debt service burdens from rising, and it lowers the monthly
payment cost of items bought on credit. But this can’t go on forever. Eventually the debt service payments
become equal to or larger than the amount debtors can borrow, and the debts (i.e., the promises to deliver
money) become too large in relation to the amount of money in existence there is to give. When promises to
deliver money (i.e., debt) can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in, the process works in
reverse and deleveraging begins. Since borrowing is simply a way of pulling spending forward, the person
spending $60,000 per year and earning $50,000 per year has to cut his spending to $40,000 for as many years as
he spent $60,000, all else being equal.
Though a bit of an oversimplification, this is the essential dynamic that drives the inflating and deflating of a bubble.

The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets. The bull markets are initially justified
because lower interest rates make investment assets, such as stocks and real estate, more attractive so they go up,
and economic conditions improve, which leads to economic growth and corporate profits, improved balance
sheets, and the ability to take on more debt—all of which make the companies worth more.
As assets go up in value, net worths and spending/income levels rise. Investors, business people, financial
intermediaries, and policy makers increase their confidence in ongoing prosperity, which supports the leveraging-up process. The boom also encourages new buyers who don’t want to miss out on the action to enter the
market, fueling the emergence of a bubble. Quite often, uneconomic lending and the bubble occur because of
implicit or explicit government guarantees that encourage lending institutions to lend recklessly.
As new speculators and lenders enter the market and confidence increases, credit standards fall. Banks lever up
and new types of lending institutions that are largely unregulated develop (these non-bank lending institutions
are referred to collectively as a “shadow banking” system). These shadow banking institutions are typically less
under the blanket of government protections. At these times, new types of lending vehicles are frequently
invented and a lot of financial engineering takes place.
The lenders and the speculators make a lot of fast, easy money, which reinforces the bubble by increasing the
speculators’ equity, giving them the collateral they need to secure new loans. At the time, most people don’t think
that is a problem; to the contrary, they think that what is happening is a reflection and confirmation of the boom.
This phase of the cycle typically feeds on itself. Taking stocks as an example, rising stock prices lead to more spending and investment, which raises earnings, which raises stock prices, which lowers credit spreads and encourages
increased lending (based on the increased value of collateral and higher earnings), which affects spending and
investment rates, etc. During such times, most people think the assets are a fabulous treasure to own—and consider
anyone who doesn’t own them to be missing out. As a result of this dynamic, all sorts of entities build up long
positions. Large asset-liability mismatches increase in the forms of a) borrowing short-term to lend long-term, b)
taking on liquid liabilities to invest in illiquid assets, and c) investing in riskier debt or other risky assets with money
borrowed from others, and/or d) borrowing in one currency and lending in another, all to pick up a perceived spread.
All the while, debts rise fast and debt service costs rise even faster. The charts below paint the picture.

In markets, when there’s a consensus, it gets priced in. This consensus is also typically believed to be a good
rough picture of what’s to come, even though history has shown that the future is likely to turn out differently
than expected. In other words, humans by nature (like most species) tend to move in crowds and weigh recent
experience more heavily than is appropriate. In these ways, and because the consensus view is reflected in the
price, extrapolation tends to occur.
At such times, increases in debt-to-income ratios are very rapid. The above chart shows the archetypal path of
debt as a percent of GDP for the deflationary deleveragings we averaged. The typical bubble sees leveraging up at
an average rate of 20 to 25 percent of GDP over three years or so. The blue line depicts the arc of the long-term
debt cycle in the form of the total debt of the economy divided by the total income of the economy as it passes
through its various phases; the red line charts the total amount of debt service payments relative to the total
amount of income.

Bubbles are most likely to occur at the tops in the business cycle, balance of payments cycle, and/or long-term debt
cycle. As a bubble nears its top, the economy is most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most
bullish. In the cases we studied, total debt-to-income levels averaged around 300 percent of GDP. To convey a few
rough average numbers, below we show some key indications of what the archetypal bubble looks like:

The Role of Monetary Policy
In many cases, monetary policy helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it. This is especially true
when inflation and growth are both good and investment returns are great. Such periods are typically interpreted to be a productivity boom that reinforces investor optimism as they leverage up to buy investment assets.
In such cases, central banks, focusing on inflation and growth, are often reluctant to adequately tighten money.
This is what happened in Japan in the late 1980s, and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s.
This is one of the biggest problems with most central bank policies—i.e., because central bankers target either
inflation or inflation and growth and don’t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth that they enable
can go to finance the creation of bubbles if inflation and real growth don’t appear to be too strong. In my opinion
it’s very important for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level—
i.e., at a level where the growth in income is likely to be large enough to service the debts regardless of what
credit is used to buy. Central bankers sometimes say that it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it’s not their role
to assess and control them—that it is their job to control inflation and growth.4 But what they control is money
and credit, and when that money and credit goes into debts that can’t be paid back, that has huge implications for
growth and inflation down the road. The greatest depressions occur when bubbles burst, and if the central banks
that are producing the debts that are inflating them won’t control them, then who will? The economic pain of
allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is so high that it is imprudent for policy makers to ignore them,
and I hope their perspective will change.

In the US, the central bank doesn’t take this debt service perspective as it applies to investment assets into consideration—e.g., it’s nowhere to be found in the Taylor Rule.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 19

While central banks typically do tighten money somewhat and short rates rise on average when inflation and
growth start to get too hot, typical monetary policies are not adequate to manage bubbles, because bubbles are
occurring in some parts of the economy and not others. Thinking about the whole economy, central banks
typically fall behind the curve during such periods, and borrowers are not yet especially squeezed by higher
debt-service costs. Quite often at this stage, their interest payments are increasingly being covered by borrowing
more rather than by income growth—a clear sign that the trend is unsustainable.
All this reverses when the bubble pops and the same linkages that inflated the bubble make the downturn
self-reinforcing. Falling asset prices decrease both the equity and collateral values of leveraged speculators, which
causes lenders to pull back. This forces speculators to sell, driving down prices even more. Also, lenders and investors
“run” (i.e., withdraw their money) from risky financial intermediaries and risky investments, causing them to have
liquidity problems. Typically, the affected market or markets are big enough and leveraged enough that the losses on
the accumulated debt are systemically threatening, which is to say that they threaten to topple the entire economy.

Spotting Bubbles
While the particulars may differ across cases (e.g., the size of the bubble; whether it’s in stocks, housing, or some
other asset5; how exactly the bubble pops; and so on), the many cases of bubbles are much more similar than they
are different, and each is a result of logical cause-and-effect relationships that can be studied and understood. If
one holds a strong mental map of how bubbles form, it becomes much easier to identify them.
To identify a big debt crisis before it occurs, I look at all the big markets and see which, if any, are in bubbles.
Then I look at what’s connected to them that would be affected when they pop. While I won’t go into exactly
how it works here, the most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are:
1)

Prices are high relative to traditional measures

2) Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels
3) There is broad bullish sentiment
4) Purchases are being financed by high leverage
5) Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted for supplies,
etc.) to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains
6) New buyers (i.e., those who weren’t previously in the market) have entered the market
7) Stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more (and tight policy to cause its popping)
5

In the 2008 crisis in the US, residential and commercial real estate, private equity, lower grade credits and, to a lesser extent, listed equities were the assets that were bought at
high prices and on lots of leverage. During both the US Great Depression and the Japanese deleveraging, stocks and real estate were also the assets of choice that were bought at
high prices and on leverage.

At this point I want to emphasize that it is a mistake to think that any one metric can serve as an indicator of an
impending debt crisis. The ratio of debt to income for the economy as a whole, or even debt service payments to
income for the economy as a whole, which is better, are useful but ultimately inadequate measures. To anticipate
a debt crisis well, one has to look at the specific debt-service abilities of the individual entities, which are lost in
these averages. More specifically, a high level of debt or debt service to income is less problematic if the average
is well distributed across the economy than if it is concentrated—especially if it is concentrated in key entities.

3) The Top
When prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and
overpriced, it becomes ripe for a reversal. This reflects a general principle: When things are so good that they
can’t get better—yet everyone believes that they will get better—tops of markets are being made.
While tops are triggered by different events, most often they occur when the central bank starts to tighten and
interest rates rise. In some cases the tightening is brought about by the bubble itself, because growth and inflation
are rising while capacity constraints are beginning to pinch. In other cases, the tightening is externally driven. For
example, for a country that has become reliant on borrowing from external creditors, the pulling back of lending
due to exogenous causes will lead to liquidity tightening. A tightening of monetary policy in the currency in which
debts are denominated can be enough to cause foreign capital to pull back. This can happen for reasons unrelated
to conditions in the domestic economy (e.g., cyclical conditions in a reserve currency country leads to a tightening
in liquidity in that currency, or a financial crisis results in a pullback of capital, etc.). Also, a rise in the currency
the debt is in relative to the currency incomes are in can cause an especially severe squeeze. Sometimes unanticipated shortfalls in cash flows due to any number of reasons can trigger the debt crises.
Whatever the cause of the debt-service squeeze, it hurts asset prices (e.g., stock prices), which has a negative
“wealth effect”6 as lenders begin to worry that they might not be able to get their cash back from those they lent
it to. Borrowers are squeezed as an increasing share of their new borrowing goes to pay debt service and/or isn’t
rolled over and their spending slows down. This is classically the result of people buying investment assets at
high prices with leverage, based on overly optimistic assumptions about future cash flow. Typically, these types
of credit/debt problems start to emerge about half a year ahead of the peak in the economy, at first in its most
vulnerable and frothy pockets. The riskiest debtors start to miss payments, lenders begin to worry, credit spreads
start to tick up, and risky lending slows. Runs from risky assets to less risky assets pick up, contributing to a
broadening of the contraction.
Typically, in the early stages of the top, the rise in short rates narrows or eliminates the spread with long rates
(i.e., the extra interest rate earned for lending long term rather than short term), lessening the incentive to lend
relative to the incentive to hold cash. As a result of the yield curve being flat or inverted (i.e., long-term interest

A negative “wealth effect” occurs when one’s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology of worry and worse financial conditions

Early on in the top, some parts of the credit system suffer, but others remain robust, so it isn’t clear that the
economy is weakening. So while the central bank is still raising interest rates and tightening credit, the seeds of
the recession are being sown. The fastest rate of tightening typically comes about five months prior to the top of
the stock market. The economy is then operating at a high rate, with demand pressing up against the capacity to
produce. Unemployment is normally at cyclical lows and inflation rates are rising. The increase in short-term
interest rates makes holding cash more attractive, and it raises the interest rate used to discount the future cash
flows of assets, weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending. It also makes items bought on credit de facto
more expensive, slowing demand. Short rates typically peak just a few months before the top in the stock market.

The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the
bigger the bust that follows. To understand the magnitude of the downturn that is likely to occur, it is less
important to understand the magnitude of the tightening than it is to understand each particular sector’s sensitivity
to tightening and how losses will cascade. These pictures are best seen by looking at each of the important sectors
of the economy and each of the big players in these sectors rather than at economy-wide averages.
In the immediate postbubble period, the wealth effect of asset price movements has a bigger impact on economic
growth rates than monetary policy does. People tend to underestimate the size of this effect. In the early stages
of a bubble bursting, when stock prices fall and earnings have not yet declined, people mistakenly judge the
22 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings,
failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what’s to come. But the
reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which
constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing
to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the asset (e.g., the weaker economic
activity leads corporate earnings to chronically disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices
further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.

In normal recessions (when monetary policy is still effective), the imbalance between the amount of money and
the need for it to service debt can be rectified by cutting interest rates enough to 1) produce a positive wealth
effect, 2) stimulate economic activity, and 3) ease debt-service burdens. This can’t happen in depressions, because
interest rates can’t be cut materially because they have either already reached close to 0 percent or, in cases
where currency outflows and currency weaknesses are great, the floor on interest rates is higher because of
credit or currency risk considerations.
This is precisely the formula for a depression. As shown, this happened in the early stage of both the 1930–32
depression and the 2008–09 depression. In well managed cases, like the US in 2007–08, the Fed lowered rates
very quickly and then, when that didn’t work, moved on to alternative means of stimulating, having learned from
its mistakes in the 1930s when the Fed was slower to ease and even tightened at times to defend the dollar’s peg
to gold.

As the depression begins, debt defaults and restructurings hit the various players, especially leveraged lenders
(e.g., banks), like an avalanche. Both lenders’ and depositors’ justified fears feed on themselves, leading to runs on
financial institutions that typically don’t have the cash to meet them unless they are under the umbrella of
government protections. Cutting interest rates doesn’t work adequately because the floors on risk-free rates have
already been hit and because as credit spreads rise, the interest rates on risky loans go up, making it difficult for
those debts to be serviced. Interest rate cuts also don’t do much to help lending institutions that have liquidity
problems and are suffering from runs. At this phase of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity (i.e., the forces of
deflation) dominate, and are not sufficiently balanced with the stimulative and inflationary forces of printing
money to cover debts (i.e., debt monetization).
With investors unwilling to continue lending and borrowers scrambling to find cash to cover their debt
payments, liquidity—i.e., the ability to sell investments for money—becomes a major concern. As an illustration,
when you own a $100,000 debt instrument, you presume that you will be able to exchange it for $100,000 in cash
and, in turn, exchange the cash for $100,000 worth of goods and services. However since the ratio of financial
assets to money is high, when a large number of people rush to convert their financial assets into money and buy
goods and services in bad times, the central bank either has to provide the liquidity that’s needed by printing
more money or allow a lot of defaults.
The depression can come from, or cause, either solvency problems or cash-flow problems. Usually a lot of both
types of problems exist during this phase. A solvency problem means that, according to accounting and regulatory rules, the entity does not have enough equity capital to operate—i.e., it is “broke” and must be shut down. So,
the accounting laws have a big impact on the severity of the debt problem at this moment. A cash-flow problem
means that an entity doesn’t have enough cash to meet its needs, typically because its own lenders are taking
money away from it—i.e., there is a “run.” A cash-flow problem can occur even when the entity has adequate
capital because the equity is in illiquid assets. Lack of cash flow is an immediate and severe problem—and as a
result, the trigger and main issue of most debt crises.
Each kind of problem requires a different approach. If a solvency problem exists (i.e., the debtor doesn’t have
enough equity capital), it has an accounting/regulatory problem that can be dealt with by either a) providing
enough equity capital or b) changing the accounting/regulatory rules, which hides the problem. Governments
can do this directly through fiscal policy or indirectly through clever monetary policies if the debt is in their own
currency. Similarly, if a cash-flow problem exists, fiscal and/or monetary policy can provide either cash or
guarantees that resolve it.

24 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

A good example of how these forces are relevant is highlighted by the differences between the debt/banking crises of
the 1980s and 2008. In the 1980s, there was not as much mark-to-market accounting (because the crisis involved
loans that weren’t traded every day in public markets), so the banks were not as “insolvent” as they were in 2008.
With more mark-to-market accounting in 2008, the banks required capital injections and/or guarantees to improve
their balance sheets. Both crises were successfully managed, though the ways they were managed had to be different.
Going into the “depression” phase of the cycle (by which I mean the severe contraction phase) some protections
learned from past depressions (e.g., bank-deposit insurance, the ability to provide lender-of-last-resort financial
supports and guarantees and to inject capital into systemically important institutions or nationalize them) are
typically in place and are helpful, but they are rarely adequate, because the exact nature of the debt crisis hasn’t
been well thought through. Typically, quite a lot of lending has taken place in the relatively unregulated “shadow
banking system,” or in new instruments that have unanticipated risks and inadequate regulations. What happens
in response to these new realities depends on the capabilities of the policy makers in the decision roles and the
freedom of the system to allow them to do what is best.
Some people mistakenly think that depressions are psychological: that investors move their money from riskier
investments to safer ones (e.g., from stocks and high-yield lending to government bonds and cash) because they’re
scared, and that the economy will be restored if they can only be coaxed into moving their money back into
riskier investments. This is wrong for two reasons: First, contrary to popular belief, the deleveraging dynamic is
not primarily psychological. It is mostly driven by the supply and demand of, and the relationships between,
credit, money, and goods and services—though psychology of course also does have an effect, especially in regard
to the various players’ liquidity positions. Still, if everyone went to sleep and woke up with no memory of what
had happened, we would be in the same position, because debtors’ obligations to deliver money would be too
large relative to the money they are taking in. The government would still be faced with the same choices that
would have the same consequences, and so on.
Related to this, if the central bank produces more money to alleviate the shortage, it will cheapen the value of
money, making a reality of creditors’ worries about being paid back an amount of money that is worth less than
what they loaned. While some people think that the amount of money in existence remains the same and simply
moves from riskier assets to less risky ones, that’s not true. Most of what people think is money is really credit,
and credit does appear out of thin air during good times and then disappear at bad times. For example, when you
buy something in a store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, “I promise to pay.” Together you and
the store owner create a credit asset and a credit liability. So where do you take the money from? Nowhere. You
created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store owner rightly believes that you and others won’t
pay the credit card company and that the credit card company won’t pay him. Then he correctly believes that the
credit “asset” he has isn’t really there. It didn’t go somewhere else; it’s simply gone.
As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as
their wealth was merely people’s promises to give them money. Now that those promises aren’t being kept, that
wealth no longer exists. When investors try to convert their investments into money in order to raise cash, they
test their ability to get paid, and in cases where it fails, panic-induced “runs” and sell-offs of securities occur.
Naturally those who experience runs, especially banks (though this is true of most entities that rely on shortterm funding), have problems raising money and credit to meet their needs, so debt defaults cascade.
Debt defaults and restructurings hit people, especially leveraged lenders (e.g., banks), and fear cascades through
the system. These fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (i.e., a
liquidity crisis). The dynamic works like this: Initially, the money coming in to debtors via incomes and borrowing is not enough to meet the debtors’ obligations; assets need to be sold and spending needs to be cut in order to
raise cash. This leads asset values to fall, which reduces the value of collateral, and in turn reduces incomes.
Since borrowers’ creditworthiness is judged by both a) the values of their assets/collaterals in relation to their
debts (i.e., their net worth) and b) the sizes of their incomes relative to the sizes of their debt-service payments,
and since both their net worth and their income fall faster than their debts, borrowers become less creditworthy
and lenders more reluctant to lend. This goes on in a self-reinforcing manner.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 25

The depression phase is dominated by the deflationary forces of debt reduction (i.e., defaults and restructurings)
and austerity occurring without material efforts to reduce debt burdens by printing money. Because one person’s
debts are another’s assets, the effect of aggressively cutting the value of those assets can be to greatly reduce the
demand for goods, services, and investment assets. For a write-down to be effective, it must be large enough to
allow the debtor to service the restructured loan. If the write-down is 30 percent, then the creditor’s assets are
reduced by that much. If that sounds like a lot, it’s actually much more. Since most lenders are leveraged (e.g.,
they borrow to buy assets), the impact of a 30 percent write-down on their net worth can be much greater. For
example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth (i.e., their
assets are twice their net worth, so the decline in asset value has twice the impact).7 Since banks are typically
leveraged about 12:1 or 15:1, that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole.
Even as debts are written down, debt burdens rise as spending and incomes fall. Debt levels also rise relative to
net worth, as shown in the chart below. As debt-to-income and debt-to-net-worth ratios go up and the availability
of credit goes down, naturally the credit contraction becomes self-reinforcing on the downside.

The capitalists-investor class experiences a tremendous loss of “real” wealth during depressions because the value
of their investment portfolios collapses (declines in equity prices are typically around 50 percent), their earned
incomes fall, and they typically face higher tax rates. As a result, they become extremely defensive. Quite often,
they are motivated to move their money out of the country (which contributes to currency weakness), dodge taxes,
and seek safety in liquid, noncredit-dependent investments (e.g., low-risk government bonds, gold, or cash).
Of course, the real economy as well as the financial economy suffers. With monetary policy constrained, the
uncontrolled credit contraction produces an economic and social catastrophe. Workers suffer as incomes collapse
and job losses are severe. Hard-working people who once were able to provide for their families lose the opportunity to have meaningful work and suddenly become either destitute or dependent. Homes are lost because
owners can no longer afford to pay their mortgages, retirement accounts are wiped out, and savings for college
are lost. These conditions can persist for many years if policy makers don’t offset the depression’s deflationary
forces with sufficient monetary stimulation of a new form.

Managing Depressions
As mentioned earlier, the policies that reduce debt burdens fall under four broad categories: 1) austerity, 2) debt
defaults/restructurings, 3) debt monetization/money printing, and 4) wealth transfers (i.e., from the haves to the

H
that case, your net worth is $50. If the value of your assets falls by 30 percent, you’re left with $70 of assets and $50 of debt. Your net worth is now $20. That’s 60 percent less
than the net worth of $50 you started with, even though your assets only fell 30 percent. Being levered 2:1 doubles the impact of the asset price decline on your net worth
(similarly 3:1 leverage would triple it, and so on).

26 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

have-nots). By using these kinds of levers well, policy makers can mitigate the worst effects of a depression and
manage both the failed lenders and borrowers and the economic conditions. But it’s important to recognize that
each of these levers has different impacts on the economy and creditworthiness. The key is to get the mix right,
so that deflationary and depressive forces are balanced with inflationary and stimulative ones.
Policy makers typically get the mix between austerity, money printing, and redistribution wrong initially.
Taxpayers are understandably angry at the debtors and at the financial institutions whose excesses caused the
debt crisis, and don’t want the government (i.e., their taxes) to bail them out. And policy makers justifiably
believe that debt excesses will happen again if lenders and borrowers don’t suffer the downsides of their actions
(which is called the “moral hazard” problem). For all these reasons, policy makers are usually reluctant and slow
to provide government supports, and the debt contraction and the agony it produces increase quickly. But the
longer they wait to apply stimulative remedies to the mix, the uglier the deleveraging becomes.8 Eventually they
choose to provide a lot of guarantees, print a lot of money, and monetize a lot of debt, which lifts the economy
into a reflationary deleveraging. If they do these things and get the mix right quickly, the depression is much
more likely to be relatively short-lived (like the short period of “depression” following the US crisis in 2008). If
they don’t, the depression is usually prolonged (like the Great Depression in the 1930s, or Japan’s “lost decade”
following its bubble in the late 1980s).
To reiterate, the two biggest impediments to managing a debt crisis are: a) the failure to know how to
handle it well and b) politics or statutory limitations on the powers of policy makers to take the necessary actions. In other words, ignorance and a lack of authority are bigger problems than debts themselves. While
being a successful investment manager is hard, it’s not nearly as hard as being a successful economic policy
maker. We investors only have to understand how the economic machine works and anticipate what will happen
next. Policy makers have to do that, plus make everything turn out well—i.e., they have to know what should be
done while navigating through all the political impediments that make it so hard to get it done. To do that
requires a lot of smarts, a willingness to fight, and political savvy—i.e., skills and heroism—and sometimes even
with all those things, the constraints under which they work still prevent them from being successful.
Below I’ll walk through each of the four levers and how they are typically used in the depression phase.

Austerity
In the depression phase, policy makers typically try austerity because that’s the obvious thing to do. It’s natural
to want to let those who got themselves and others in trouble to bear the costs. The problem is that even deep
austerity doesn’t bring debt and income back into balance. When spending is cut, incomes are also cut, so it takes
an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in the debt/income ratios.
As the economy contracts, government revenues typically fall. At the same time, demands on the government
increase. As a result, deficits typically increase. Seeking to be fiscally responsible, at this point governments tend
to raise taxes.
Both moves are big mistakes.

“Printing Money” to Stop the Bleeding and Stimulate the Economy
Quite often “runs” on lending institutions occur, especially those that aren’t protected by government guarantees.
That puts the central bank and the central government in the position of having to decide which depositors/
lenders should be protected from losses and which should be allowed to sustain them, and which institutions are
systemically important and should be saved—and how to do these things in a way that maximizes the safety of the

I don’t mean to convey that debt reductions and austerity don’t play beneficial roles in the deleveraging process because they do—but unless they are balanced with reflationary
money printing, monetization, and guarantees, they cause a huge amount of pain while not doing enough to restore the economy.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 27

financial/economic system while minimizing costs to the government/taxpayers. At such times all sorts of
guarantees are offered to systemically critical financial institutions—and quite often some of these institutions are
nationalized. Typically there are a lot of laws and politics that affect how quickly and how well this is done. Some
of the money that is needed comes from the government (i.e., it is appropriated through the budget process) and
some from the central banks (by “printing”). Governments inevitably do both, though in varying degrees. In
addition to providing money to some essential banks, governments also typically provide money to some nonbank
entities they consider essential.
Next, they must ease the credit crunch and stimulate the overall economy. Since the government is likely having
trouble raising funds through taxation and borrowing, central banks are forced to choose between “printing”
still more money to buy their governments’ debts or allowing their governments and their private sector to
compete for the limited supply of money, which will only tighten money further. Inevitably, they choose to print.
Typically, though not necessarily, these moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts
fail to rectify the imbalance and reverse the deleveraging process. However, those early efforts do typically cause
temporary periods of relief that are manifest in bear-market rallies in financial assets and increased economic
activity. During the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market (of between 16 percent and 48
percent) in a bear market that declined a total of 89 percent. All of those rallies were triggered by government
actions that were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance. When they are managed well, those shifts in
policies to “print money,” buy assets, and provide guarantees are what moves the debt cycle from its depression/“ugly
deleveraging” phase to its expansion/“beautiful deleveraging” phase. The chart below shows how this “money
printing” happened in the US in the 1930s and again after 2008.

While highly stimulative monetary policy is a critical part of a deleveraging, it is typically not sufficient. When
risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these
entities running. They must act immediately to:
••

Curtail panic and guarantee liabilities. Governments can increase guarantees on deposits and debt
issuance. Central banks can provide systemically important institutions (i.e., institutions whose failures
would threaten the ongoing operating of the financial system and/or that of the economy) with injections
of money. Occasionally, governments can force liquidity to remain in the banking system by imposing
deposit freezes, which is generally undesirable because it intensifies the panic, but is sometimes necessary
because there is no other way of providing that money/liquidity.

••

Provide liquidity. When private credit is contracting and liquidity is tight, the central bank can ensure
that sufficient liquidity is provided to the financial system by lending against a widening range of
collateral or to an increasingly wide range of financial institutions that are not normally considered part
of their lending practices.

28 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

••

Support the solvency of systemically important institutions. The first step is usually to incentivize
the private sector to address the problem, often by supporting mergers between failed banks and healthy
banks and by regulatory pushes to issue more capital to the private sector. In addition, accounting
adjustments can be made to reduce the immediate need for capital to maintain solvency, buying more time
for the institutions to earn their way out of their problems.

••

Recapitalize/nationalize/cover losses of systemically important financial institutions. When the
above approaches are insufficient to deal with the solvency problems of systemically important financial
institutions, governments must step in to recapitalize failed banks. Moving to stabilize lenders and
maintain the credit supply is critical to preventing a crisis from getting worse. Certain institutions are
part of the plumbing of the system; one would hate to lose them even if they’re not making money at the
moment. It would be like losing a shipping port in a depression because the port goes broke. You want the
port to continue to operate and ships to come in, so you have to protect it one way or another—whether
through a nationalization, loans, or capital injections.

Debt Defaults/Restructurings
Ultimately, the process of cleansing existing bad debts is critical for the future flow of money and credit and for a
return to prosperity. The challenge for policy makers is to allow that process to work itself out in an orderly way that
ensures economic and social stability. The best-managed cases are those in which policy makers a) swiftly recognize
the magnitude of the credit problems; b) don’t save every institution that is expendable, balancing the benefits of
allowing broke institutions to fail and be restructured with the risks that such failures can have detrimental effects
on other creditworthy lenders and borrowers; c) create or restore robust credit pipes that allow for future borrowing
by creditworthy borrowers; and d) ensure acceptable growth and inflation conditions while the bad debts are being
worked out. Longer term, the most important decision that policy makers have to make is whether they will change
the system to fix the root causes of the debt problems or simply restructure the debts so that the pain is distributed
over the population and over time so that the debt does not impose an intolerable burden.
These things rarely happen right away. Policy makers typically fail to recognize the magnitude of the problem
initially, instead enacting a number of one-off policies that are insufficient to move the needle. It is only after what is
usually a couple of years and a lot of unnecessary economic pain that they finally act decisively. How quickly and
aggressively policy makers respond is among the most important factors in determining the severity and length of
the depression. And the question of exactly how these costs are divided between the government (which means the
society as a whole) and the bond holders (of varying seniorities), equity holders, depositors, etc., is an important one.
Typically, nonsystemically important institutions are forced to absorb their losses, and if they fail, are allowed to
go bankrupt. The resolution of these institutions can take several different forms. In many cases (about 80 percent
of the cases we studied), they are merged with healthy institutions. In some other cases, the assets are liquidated
or transferred to an “asset-management company” (AMC) set up by the government to be sold piecemeal.
In some cases, policy makers recognize that ensuring the viability of the whole banking system is critical and
liquidity and solvency measures are taken at the banking system level. In recent years it has become common for
guarantees of bank liabilities to be issued in countries in the developed world. In rare cases, government-financed
bank recapitalization is done across all banks, rather than focused solely on systemically important institutions.
There are relatively clear lines for which creditors receive protections:
••

Small depositors are given preference and experience minimal or no losses (in nearly every
case). Often this is explicitly defined as part of a deposit insurance scheme. Coverage is usually expanded
during the crisis period in order to ensure liquidity for the banks. Even in cases where there isn’t an
explicit deposit insurance scheme, depositors are often prioritized. In around 30 percent of cases studied,
depositors did take losses, though they were often on foreign-exchange deposits through conversion at
below-market exchange rates.

••

In most cases when institutions fail, equity, subordinated debt, and large depositors absorb losses
regardless of whether the institution was systemically important or not. Protection of senior and
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 29

subordinated debt holders, and equity recapitalizations that are simply dilutive to existing equity holders,
are seen mostly in the developed world.
••

Sometimes policy makers prioritize domestic creditors over foreign creditors, especially when
their loans are to private-sector players and are lower down in the capital structure. This is
especially true as deposit insurance programs run low on funds. But at the same time governments often
end up prioritizing the payment of loans from multinational institutions like the IMF and BIS, as it’s
important to maintain availability of support from these public entities, who effectively act as lenders of
last resort to countries under stress.

Typically, the process of dealing with the failed lenders is accompanied by a spate of regulatory reforms.
Sometimes these changes are modest and sometimes they are very large; sometimes they are for the better and
sometimes they are for the worse. They range from changes in how banks operate (e.g., putting in deposit
guarantees in the 1930s or Dodd-Frank and the Volcker rule in 2010 in the US) to labor market reforms, from
requiring banks to improve credit standards to opening the banking system to competition (including foreign
entrants) to raising capital requirements and removing protections to lenders.
Politics plays a big role in determining what reforms are made. In some cases, such reforms end up distorting
private-sector market-based incentives on the flow of lending, which can limit the flow of credit to creditworthy
borrowers and/or increase the risks of future credit problems emerging. In other cases, they improve the flow of
credit, protect households, and reduce the risk of debt problems in the future.
There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed: They are
either a) transferred to a separate entity (an AMC) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal (about 40
percent of the cases studied) or b) they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage
(about 60 percent of cases). And there are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans: a)
restructuring (e.g., working out the loans through extended terms), b) debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures, c)
direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties, and d) securitizations.
The use of an AMC generally accelerates the management of the debt problem because it frees up existing banks
to return to lending and helps consolidate the bad debts to a centralized entity that can manage sales and restructurings. Selling assets to AMCs also often serves as a mechanism to engage in transfers to banks by pricing them
at above market prices. AMCs are typically publicly owned entities that are mandated to sell the assets within
some targeted time frame (e.g., 10 years) while minimizing costs to the taxpayer and disruptions of asset markets.
They do this by seeking to quickly sell off the performing assets of failed institutions and working over time to
manage and sell off nonperforming assets. In some cases AMCs have explicit goals to restructure the nonperforming debts to reduce debt burdens. They are generally financed by some form of direct or pseudo-government
debt issuance, and they cannot work well when legal, political, or funding constraints limit their ability to
recognize bad debts and restructure them.
Allowing the original lender to manage its bad debts often occurs when the original lender is state-sponsored,
which makes it closer to a public AMC. In other cases losses may be allowed to sit on the lender’s balance sheet if
they are not too large, if the technical expertise to create a centralized AMC doesn’t exist, or if effective resolution mechanisms already exist.
Much as with lenders, there is usually a relatively clear distinction between how systemically or strategically
important borrowers are handled and how those that aren’t are.
••

For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones, policy makers generally take steps
to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of
the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps,
through reducing the existing debts, lowering interest rates, or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally
policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity.
This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts.

30 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

••

Nonsystemically important borrowers are usually left to restructure their loans with private lenders or
are allowed to go bankrupt and are liquidated.

••

Central governments often take steps to help reduce the debt burdens on the household sector. AMCs may
also take steps to restructure debt burdens rather than foreclosing on the loans as part of their goal of
maximizing recovery values.

The table below shows how frequently the previously described policy moves were deployed in our study of the

Redistributing Wealth
Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become particularly galling for the less privileged during hard
times. As a general rule, if rich people share a budget with poor people and there is an economic downturn, there
will be economic and political conflict. It is during such times that populism on both the left and the right tends to
emerge. How well the people and the political system handle this is key to how well the economy and the society
weather the period. As shown below, both inequality and populism are on the rise in the US today, much as they
were in the 1930s. In both cases, the net worth of the top 0.1 percent of the population equaled approximately that
of the bottom 90 percent combined.

In some cases, raising taxes on the rich becomes politically attractive because the rich made a lot of money in the
boom—especially those working in the financial sector—and are perceived to have caused the problems because
of their greed. The central bank’s purchases of financial assets also disproportionately benefit the rich, because
the rich own many more such assets. Big political shifts to the left typically hasten redistributive efforts. This
typically drives the rich to try to move their money in ways and to places that provide protection, which itself has
effects on asset and currency markets. It can also cause an economic “hollowing out” of those areas because the
big income earners, who are also the big income taxpayers, leave, reducing overall tax revenues and leading these
areas to suffer sharp declines in property values and reductions in services.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises

31

Typically, increased taxation takes the form of greater income, property, and consumption taxes because these
forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues. Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also
increased,9 though these typically raise very little money because so much wealth is illiquid that it is practically
difficult to collect on, and forcing the taxpayer to sell liquid assets to make their tax payments undermines
capital formation. Regardless, transfers rarely occur in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging
(unless there are “revolutions” and huge amounts of property are nationalized).

5) The “Beautiful Deleveraging”
A “beautiful deleveraging” happens when the four levers are moved in a balanced way so as to reduce intolerable
shocks and produce positive growth with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation. More specifically, deleveragings become beautiful when there is enough stimulation (i.e., through “printing of money”/debt monetization
and currency devaluation) to offset the deflationary deleveraging forces (austerity/defaults) and bring the
nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate—but not so much stimulation that inflation is accelerated,
the currency is devaluated, and a new debt bubble arises.
The best way of negating the deflationary depression is for the central bank to provide adequate liquidity and
credit support, and, depending on different key entities’ needs for capital, for the central government to provide
that too. Recall that spending comes in the form of either money or credit. When increased spending cannot be
financed with increased debt because there is too much debt relative to the amount of money there is to service
the debt, increased spending and debt-service relief must come from increased money. This means that the
central bank has to increase the amount of money in the system.
The central bank can do this by lending against a wider range of collateral (both of lower quality and longer
maturity) and also by buying (monetizing) lower-quality and/or longer-term debt. This produces relief and, if it’s
done in the right amounts, allows a deleveraging to occur with positive growth. The right amounts are those that
a) neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit market collapse and b) get the nominal growth rate
marginally above the nominal interest rate to tolerably spread out the deleveraging process.
So, what do I mean by that? Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt. For example: Let’s assume that a
country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-income ratio of 100 percent. That means that the amount of debt
it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year. Now think about the interest rate on
that debt. Let’s say it’s 2 percent. If debt is 100 and the interest rate is 2 percent, then if no debt is repaid it will be 102
after one year. If income is 100 and it grows at 1 percent, then income will be 101, so the debt burden will increase
from 100/100 to 102/101. So for the burdens from existing debt not to increase, nominal income growth must be
higher than nominal interest rates, and the higher the better (provided it is not so high that it produces unacceptable
inflation and/or unacceptable currency declines).
People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won’t if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are
balanced with this reflationary force. That’s not a theory—it’s been repeatedly proven out in history. Remember,
spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices as a dollar of
spending paid for with credit. By “printing money,” the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit
with an increase in the amount of money. This “printing” takes the form of central bank purchases of government securities and nongovernment assets such as corporate securities, equities, and other assets, which is
reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity are
contracting. Traditional economists see that as the velocity of money declining, but it’s nothing of the sort. What
is happening at such times is that credit destruction is being offset by money creation. If the balance between
replacing credit and actively stimulating the economy is right, this isn’t inflationary.
But there is such a thing as abusive use of stimulants. Because stimulants work so well relative to the alternatives,
there is a real risk that they can be abused, causing an “ugly inflationary deleveraging” (like the Weimar

The extent to which wealth taxes can be applied varies by country. For example, they have been judged to be unconstitutional in the US but have been allowed in other countries.

32 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

hyperinflation of the 1920s, or those in Argentina and Brazil in the 1980s). The key is to avoid printing too much
money. If policy makers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn’t so dramatic. Getting this balance right is
much more difficult in countries that have a large percentage of debt denominated in foreign currency and owned
by foreign investors (as in Weimar Germany and the South American countries) because that debt can’t be
monetized or restructured as easily.
Printing money/debt monetization and government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate
cuts won’t work, though these tools are of little value in countries that are constrained from printing or don’t have
assets to back printing up and can’t easily negotiate the redistributions of the debt burdens. All of the deleveragings
that we have studied (which is most of those that occurred over the past hundred years) eventually led to big waves
of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks). In different
cases, policy makers have varied which exact combination of the levers they used, typically as a function of the
nature of their monetary systems. The chart below conveys the archetypal path of money printing in deflationary
deleveragings over the 21 cases. The money printing occurs in two classic waves—central banks first provide liquidity
to stressed institutions, and then they conduct large-scale asset purchases to broadly stimulate the economy.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 33

Typically, governments with gold-, commodity-, or foreign-currency-pegged money systems are forced to have
tighter monetary policies to protect the value of their currency than governments with fiat monetary systems.
But eventually the debt contractions become so painful that they relent, break the link, and print (i.e., either they
abandon these systems or change the amount/pricing of the commodity that they will exchange for a unit of money).
For example, when the value of the dollar (and therefore the amount of money) was tied to gold during the Great
Depression, suspending the promise to convert dollars into gold so that the currency could be devalued and more
money created was key to creating the bottoms in the stock and commodity markets and the economy. Printing
money, making asset purchases, and providing guarantees were much easier to do in the 2008 financial crisis, as they
didn’t require a legalized and official change in the currency regime. The chart below shows the archetypal path of
gold prices. In the US Great Depression, gold rose overnight when Roosevelt broke the gold peg, and during the more
recent financial crisis, Fed moves helped push down the value of the dollar versus all currencies, including gold.

In the end, policy makers always print. That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit, big restructurings
wipe out too much wealth too fast, and transfers of wealth from haves to have-nots don’t happen in sufficient size
without revolutions. Also, printing money is not inflationary if the size and character of the money creation offsets
the size and character of the credit contraction. It is simply negating deflation. In virtually all past deleveragings,
policy makers had to discover this for themselves after they first tried other paths without satisfactory results.
History has shown that those who did it quickly and well (like the US in 2008–09) have derived much better
results than those who did it late (like the US in 1930–33).
The table below summarizes the typical amount of printing and currency devaluation required to create the turn
from a depression to a “beautiful deleveraging.” On average the printing of money has been around 4 percent of
GDP per year. There is a large initial currency devaluation of around 50 percent against gold, and deficits widen
to about 6 percent of GDP. On average, this aggressive stimulation comes two to three years into the depression,
after stocks have fallen more than 50 percent, economic activity has fallen about 10 percent, and unemployment
has risen to around 10 to 15 percent, though there is a lot of variation.
I’m providing these numbers only as broad indicators, since circumstances vary considerably. When looking at
the differences (which are very interesting but beyond the scope of this study), it is clear that when monetary and
fiscal policies are rolled out faster and smarter, the results are much better than these averages.

To reiterate, the key to having a beautiful deleveraging lies in balancing the inflationary forces against the
deflationary ones. That’s because too much money printing can also produce an ugly inflationary deleveraging
(which we will go through later). The right amounts of stimulus are those that a) neutralize what would otherwise
be a deflationary credit-market collapse and b) get the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate by
enough to relieve the debt burdens, but not by so much that it leads to a run on debt assets.
In summary, when all is said and done, only a few things distinguish whether a deleveraging is managed well or
poorly. I have outlined them below. A lot of pain can be avoided if policy makers can learn from the common
pitfalls and understand the policies characteristic of beautiful deleveragings.
Well Managed

Poorly Managed

Bubble

• Central banks consider growth in debt and its effects on
asset markets in managing policy. If they can prevent the
bubble, they can prevent the bust.
• Central banks use macroprudential policies to target
restraints in debt growth where bubbles are emerging and
allow debt growth where it is not excessive.
• Fiscal policies are tightened.

• Big bubbles are fueled by speculators and lenders over-extrapolating past successes and making further debt-financed
investments, and by central banks focusing just on inflation
and/or growth and not considering debt bubbles in
investment assets, thus keeping credit cheap for too long.

Top

• Central banks constrict the bubble either with the control of
broad monetary policy or with well-chosen macroprudential
policies and then ease selectively (via macroprudential
policies).

• Central banks continue to tighten well after bursting the
bubble.

Depression

• Central banks provide ample liquidity, ease short rates
quickly until they hit 0%, and then pursue aggressive
monetizations, using aggressive targeted macroprudential
policies.
• Governments pursue aggressive and sustained fiscal
stimulus, easing past the turn.
• Systemically important institutions are protected.

• Central banks are slower to cut rates, provide more limited
liquidity, and tighten too early. They also wait too long to
pursue aggressive monetization.
• Governments pursue austerity without adequately easing.
• Systemically important institutions are left damaged or
failed.

Beautiful
• Reflations begin with aggressive monetizations through asset
Deleveraging purchases or big currency declines, enough to bring nominal
growth above nominal rates.
• Stimulative macroprudential policies are targeted to protect
systemically important entities and to stimulate high-quality
credit growth.
• Nonsystemically important institutions are allowed to fail in
an orderly way.
• Policy makers balance the depressive forces of defaults and
austerity with the reflationary forces of debt monetization,
currency declines, and fiscal stimulus.

• Initial monetizations stutter and start. Asset purchases are
more muted and consist more of cash-like instruments
rather than risky assets, so that purchases don't produce a
wealth effect. Stimulation of the central bank is undermined
by fiscal austerity.
• Overindebted entities are protected even though they are
not systemically important, leading to zombie banks and
malaise.
• Ugly inflationary depressions arise in cases where policy
makers allow faith in the currency to collapse and print too
much money.

6) “Pushing on a String”
Late in the long-term debt cycle, central bankers sometimes struggle to convert their stimulative policies into
increased spending because the effects of lowering interest rates and central banks’ purchases of debt assets have
diminished. At such times the economy enters a period of low growth and low returns on assets, and central
bankers have to move to other forms of monetary stimulation in which money and credit go more directly to
support spenders. When policy makers faced these conditions in the 1930s, they coined the phrase “pushing on a
string.” One of the biggest risks at this stage is that if there is too much printing of money/monetization and too
severe a currency devaluation relative to the amounts of the deflationary alternatives, an “ugly inflationary
deleveraging” can occur.
To help understand the different kinds of monetary policies that can be used throughout a deleveraging, I think
of them as coming in three different styles, each with its own effects on the economy and markets.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 35

Monetary Policy 1
Interest-rate driven monetary policy (which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1) is the most effective because it
has the broadest impact on the economy. When central banks reduce interest rates, they stimulate the
economy by a) producing a positive wealth effect (because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most
investments); b) making it easier to buy items on credit (because the monthly payments decline), raising demand—
especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c) reducing debt-service burdens
(which improves cash flows and spending). MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis, but when short-term
interest rates hit around 0 percent, it no longer works effectively, so central banks must go to the second type.

Monetary Policy 2
“Quantitative easing” (QE) as it is now called (i.e., “printing money” and buying financial assets,
typically debt assets), is Monetary Policy 2. It works by affecting the behavior of investors/savers as opposed
to borrowers/spenders, because it is driven by purchases of financial assets, typically debt assets that impact
investors/savers the most. When the central bank buys a bond, it gives investors/savers cash, which they typically
use to buy another financial asset that they think is more attractive. What they do with that money and credit
makes all the difference in the world. When they invest in the sort of assets that finance spending, that stimulates
the economy. When they invest in those that don’t (such as financial assets), there must be very large market gains
before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who have enjoyed the
market gains than from those who haven’t. In other words, QE certainly benefits investors/savers (i.e., those who
own financial assets) much more than people who don’t, thus widening the wealth gap.
While MP2 is generally less effective than interest-rate changes, it is most effective when risk and liquidity
premiums are large, because it causes those premiums to fall. When risk premiums are large, and money is added
to the system, actual risks are reduced at the same time that there is more money seeking returns, which triggers
purchases of riskier assets that are offering higher expected returns, driving their prices up and producing a
positive wealth effect.
But over time, the use of QE to stimulate the economy declines in effectiveness because risk premiums are
pushed down and asset prices are pushed up to levels beyond which they are difficult to push further, and the
wealth effect diminishes. In other words, at higher prices and lower expected returns, the compensation
for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up, which would drive prospective
returns down further. In fact, the reward-to-risk ratio could make those who are long a lot of assets view that
terribly returning asset called cash as more appealing. As a result, QE becomes less and less effective. If they
provide QE and private credit growth doesn’t pick up, policy makers feel like they are pushing on a string.
At this stage, policy makers sometimes monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for
its declining effectiveness. While this can help for a bit, there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead
people to question the currency’s suitability as a store hold of value. This can lead them to start moving to
alternative currencies, such as gold. The fundamental economic challenge most economies have in this phase is
that the claims on purchasing power are greater than the abilities to meet them.
Think of it this way: There are only goods and services. Financial assets are claims on them. In other words, holders
of investments/assets (i.e., capitalists/investors) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power
to get goods and services. At the same time, workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their
contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services. But since debt/
money/currency have no intrinsic value, the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed
to be able to buy, so they have to be devalued or restructured. In other words, when there are too many debt
liabilities/assets, they either have to be reduced via debt restructurings or monetized. Policy makers tend to use
monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary. But monetization simply
swaps one IOU (debt) for another (newly printed money). The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme. Since
there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs, there’s a worry that people
may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever.

36 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose a structural challenge for monetary policy.
With Monetary Policy 1 (interest rates) and Monetary Policy 2 (QE) at their limits, the central bank has very little
ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—i.e., monetary policy has little “gas in the tank.” This
typically happens in the later years of the long-term debt cycle (e.g., 1937-38 and now in the US), which can lead
to “pushing on a string.” When this happens, policy makers need to look beyond QE to the new forms of
monetary and fiscal policy characterized by Monetary Policy 3.

Monetary Policy 3
Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and
incentivizes them to spend it. Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend the incremental money
and credit they get than less wealthy people, when the wealth gap is large and the economy is weak, directing
spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive.
Logic and history show us that there is a continuum of actions to stimulate spending that have varying degrees of
control to them. At one end are coordinated fiscal and monetary actions, in which fiscal policy makers provide
stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities
to spend. At the other end, the central bank can provide “helicopter money” by sending cash directly to citizens
without coordination with fiscal policy makers. Typically, though not always, there is a coordination of monetary
policy and fiscal policy in a way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services. Central banks
can also exert influence through macroprudential policies that help to shape things in ways that are similar to
how fiscal policies might. For simplicity, I have organized that continuum and provided references to specific
prior cases of each below.
••

An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending. Sometimes this is paired with QE that buys most of the
new issuance (e.g., in Japan in the 1930s, US during World War II, US and UK in the 2000s).

••

Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending, where the Treasury isn’t on the hook for the debt, because:
––

The central bank can print money to cover debt payments (e.g., Germany in the 1930s).

––

 he central bank can lend to entities other than the government that will use it for stimulus projects
T
(e.g., lending to development banks in China in 2008).

••

Not bothering to go through issuing debt, and instead giving newly printed money directly to
the government to spend. Past cases have included printing fiat currency (e.g., in Imperial China,
the American Revolution, the US Civil War, Germany in the 1930s, and the UK during World War I) or
debasing hard currency (Ancient Rome, Imperial China, 16th-century England).

••

Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households (i.e., “helicopter money”). When
we refer to “helicopter money,” we mean directing money into the hands of spenders (e.g., US veterans’
bonuses during the Great Depression, Imperial China).
How that money is directed could take different forms—the basic variants are either to direct the same
amount to everyone or aim for some degree of helping one or more groups over others (e.g., giving money
to the poor rather than to the rich). The money can be provided as a one-off or over time (perhaps as a
universal basic income). All of these variants can be paired with an incentive to spend it—such as the
money disappearing if it’s not spent within a year. The money could also be directed to specific investment
accounts (like retirement, education, or accounts earmarked for small-business investments) targeted
toward socially desirable spending/investment. Another potential way to craft the policy is to distribute
returns/holdings from QE to households instead of to the government.

••

Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation (the “year of Jubilee”) as occurred in
Ancient Rome, the Great Depression, and Iceland.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 37

While I won’t offer opinions on each of these, I will say that the most effective approaches involve fiscal/
monetary coordination, because that ensures that both the providing and the spending of money will occur. If
central banks just give people money (helicopter money), that’s typically less adequate than giving them that
money with incentives to spend it. However, sometimes it is difficult for those who set monetary policy to
coordinate with those who set fiscal policy, in which case other approaches are used.
Also, keep in mind that sometimes the policies don’t fall exactly into these categories, as they have elements of
more than one of them. For example, if the government gives a tax break, that’s probably not helicopter money,
but it depends on how it’s financed. The government can also spend money directly without a loan financed by
the central bank—that is helicopter money through fiscal channels.
While central banks influence the costs and availabilities of credit for the economy as whole, they also have powers
to influence the costs and availabilities of credit for targeted parts of the financial system through their regulatory
authorities. These policies, which are called macroprudential policies, are especially important when it’s desirable
to differentiate entities—e.g., when it is desirable to restrict credit to an overly indebted area while simultaneously
stimulating the rest of the economy, or when its desirable to provide credit to some targeted entities but not provide
it broadly. Macroprudential policies take numerous forms that are valuable in different ways in all seven stages of
the big debt cycle. Because explaining them here would require too much of a digression, they are explained in
some depth in the Appendix.

7) Normalization
Eventually the system gets back to normal, though the recovery in economic activity and capital formation tends
to be slow, even during a beautiful deleveraging. It typically takes roughly 5 to 10 years (hence the term “lost
decade”) for real economic activity to reach its former peak level. And it typically takes longer, around a decade,
for stock prices to reach former highs, because it takes a very long time for investors to become comfortable
taking the risk of holding equities again (i.e., equity risk premiums are high).

Now that you have this template for deflationary depressions in mind, I encourage you to read the detailed
accounts of the US 2007–2011 and 1928–1937 big debt cycles shown in Part 2 and then look at the summary
statistics and auto-text of the 21 case studies shown in Part 3.

38 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises
In the previous section, we looked at the archetypal deflationary debt crisis, which we created by averaging the 21
deflationary cycles you can review in Part 3. We will now look at the archetypal inflationary debt crisis, which we
created by averaging the 27 worst cases of inflationary cycles (also shown in Part 3). After reviewing this template,
I encourage you to read about the hyperinflation in Germany’s Weimar Republic, which is examined in depth in
Part 2, to compare it to the archetypal case described here. Before we turn to the charts and other data, please
remember that:
••

Currency and debt serve two purposes: to be 1) mediums of exchange and 2) store holds of wealth

••

Debt is one person’s asset and another’s liability

••

Debt is a promise to pay in a certain type of currency (e.g., dollars, euro, yen, pesos, etc.)

••

Holders of debt assets expect to convert them into money and then into goods and services down the
road, so they are very conscious of the rate of its loss of purchasing power (i.e., inflation) relative to the
compensation (i.e., the interest rate) they get for holding it

••

Central banks can only produce the type of money and credit that they control (e.g., the Fed makes dollar
denominated money and credit, the BoJ makes Japanese yen money and credit, etc.)

••

Through a symbiotic relationship, over time central banks and free-market borrowers and lenders
typically create bigger and bigger piles of debt assets and debt liabilities

••

The bigger the pile, the greater the challenge for central bankers to balance the opposing pressures so the
pile doesn’t topple over into a deflationary depression in one direction or an inflationary depression in the
other

••

Policy makers (those who control monetary and fiscal policies) can usually balance these opposing forces
in debt crises because they have a lot of power to redistribute the burdens so they are spread out, though
they can’t always balance them well

••

Central banks typically relieve debt crises by “printing” a lot of the currency in which the debt is
denominated, which, while stimulating spending on investment assets and the economy, also cheapens
the value of the currency (all else being equal)

••

If a currency falls in relation to another currency at a rate that is greater than the currency’s interest rate, the
holder of the debt in the weakening currency will lose money. If investors expect that weakness to continue
without being compensated with higher interest rates, a dangerous currency dynamic will develop.

That last dynamic, i.e., the currency dynamic, is what produces inflationary depressions. Holders of debt
denominated in the poorly returning currency are motivated to sell it and move their assets into another
currency or a non-currency store hold of wealth like gold. When there is a debt crisis and economic weakness in
a country, it is typically impossible for the central bank to raise interest rates enough to compensate for the
currency weakness, so the money leaves that country and currency for safer countries. When so much money
leaves the country that lending dries up, the central bank is faced with the choice of letting the credit markets
tighten or printing money, which produces a lot of it. While it is widely known that central banks manage the
trade-offs between inflation and growth by changing interest rates and liquidity in the system, what is not
widely known is that the central bank’s trade-offs between inflation and growth are easier to manage when
money is flowing into a country’s currency/debt and more difficult to manage when it’s flowing out. That’s
because if there is more demand for the currency/debt, that will push the currency/debt prices up, which, all else
being equal, will push inflation down and growth up (assuming the central bank keeps the amount of money and
credit steady); when there is less demand, the reverse will happen. How much changing demand there is for a
country’s currency/debt will create changes in the currency versus changes in interest rates will depend on how
the central bank moves its levers—which I’ll cover below. For now, suffice it to say that in times when money is
flowing out of a currency, real interest rates need to rise less if real exchange rates fall more (and vice versa).

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 39

Capital outflows tend to happen when an environment is inhospitable (e.g., because debt, economic, and/or
political problems exist), and they typically weaken the currency a lot. To make matters worse, those who fund
their activities in the country that has the weaker currency by borrowing the stronger currency see their debt
costs soar; that drives down the weaker currency relative to the stronger one even more. For these reasons,
countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high
dependence on foreign capital typically have significant currency weaknesses. The currency weakness
is what causes inflation when there is a depression.
Normally this all runs its course when the currency and the debt prices go down enough to make them very
cheap. More specifically, the squeeze ends when a) the debts are defaulted on and/or enough money is created to
alleviate the squeeze, b) the debt service requirements are reduced in some other way (e.g., forbearance) and/or
c) the currency depreciates much more than inflation picks up, so that the country’s assets and the items it sells
to the world become so competitively priced that its balance of payments improves. But a lot depends on politics.
If the markets are allowed to run their courses, the adjustments eventually take place and the problems are
resolved, but if the politics get so bad that productivity is thrown into a self-reinforcing downward spiral, that
spiral can go on for a long time.

Which Countries/Currencies Are Most Vulnerable to Severe Inflationary Deleveragings
or Hyperinflations?
While inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies, they are far more likely in countries that:
••

Don’t have a reserve currency (so there is not a global bias to hold their currency/debt as a store hold of wealth)

••

Have low foreign-exchange reserves (the cushion to protect against capital outflows is small)

••

Have a large foreign debt (so there is a vulnerability to the cost of the debt rising via increases in either
interest rates or the value of the currency the debtor has to deliver, or a shortage of the availability of
dollar denominated credit)

••

Have a large and increasing budget and/or current account deficit (causing the need to borrow or print
money to fund the deficits)

••

Have negative real interest rates (i.e., interest rates that are significantly less than inflation rates), therefore
inadequately compensating lenders for holding the currency/debt

••

Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns in the currency (increasing lack of trust in the
value of the currency/debt)

Generally speaking, the greater the degree to which these things exist, the greater the degree of the inflationary
depression. The most iconic case is the German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s, which is examined at length
in Part 2. If you are interested in reviewing actual case studies showing the reasons why inflationary depressions
happen rather than deflationary ones, it is worth noting the differences between the Weimar case study and the
US Great Depression and 2007–2011 case studies, which are also examined in Part 2.
Can reserve-currency countries that don’t have significant foreign-currency debt have inflationary depressions?
While they are much less likely to have inflationary contractions that are as severe, they can have inflationary
depressions, though they emerge more slowly and later in the deleveraging process, after a sustained and repeated
overuse of stimulation to reverse deflationary deleveraging. Any country, including one with a reserve currency, can
experience some movement out of its currency, which changes the severity of the trade-off between inflation and
growth described earlier. If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth
stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for its currency, erode its reserve currency
status (e.g., make investors view it as less of a store hold of wealth), and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one.

40 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle
Classically, inflationary deleveragings follow the ebbs and flows of money and credit through five stages that
mirror the stages of deflationary deleveragings, but that are different in important ways. Over the past few
decades I have navigated through a number of inflationary deleveragings and researched many more. They
transpire pretty much as deflationary deleveragings do up until the fourth stage, the depression.
I’ll begin this section with a look at the stages of the archetypal inflationary deleveraging, just as I did in the
prior section. (This archetype was created by averaging 27 inflationary deleveragings in which there was a lot of
debt denominated in foreign currencies.) Then I’ll compare the archetype to four specific hyperinflationary cases
in order to highlight their differences.

1) The Early Part of the Cycle
In the healthy upswing, favorable capital flows are a result of good fundamentals—i.e., because the country is
competitive and there is potential for productive investment. At this point, debt levels are low, and balance sheets
are healthy. That stimulates export sales and hence foreign capital, which funds investments that produce good
returns and yield productive growth.
Capital flows—both within countries and among them—are typically the most important flows to watch because they
are the most volatile. As the cycle begins, debt and incomes rise at comparable rates and both debt and equity
markets are strong, which encourages investing, often with borrowed money. The private sector, government, and
banks start to borrow, which makes sense for them because incomes are rising quickly, making it easier to service
the debt. These strong fundamentals and early levering up set the country up for a boom that in turn attracts
more capital.
The positive, self-reinforcing cycle is enhanced when the demand for the currency is improving. If the currency
is cheap enough to offer attractive opportunities to foreign investors (who will typically lend to or invest in
entities that can produce inexpensively in that country and sell into export markets to earn the foreign currency
to provide them with a good return), and/or the country sells more to foreigners than it buys from them, a
country’s balance of payments will become favorable—i.e., the demand for its currency will be greater than its
supply. This makes the central bank’s job easier—i.e., it can get more growth per unit of inflation—because the
positive inflows can be used to appreciate the currency, to lower interest rates, and/or to increase reserves,
depending on how the central bank chooses to handle it.
At these times of early currency strength, some central banks choose to enter the foreign-currency exchange
market to sell their own currency for the incoming foreign currency in order to prevent it from rising (and to
prevent the adverse economic effects of its rise). If the central bank does this, it needs to do something with that
newly acquired currency, which is to buy investment assets denominated in that foreign currency (most typically
bonds) and put them in an account called “foreign-exchange reserves.” Foreign-exchange reserves are like
savings: They can be used to bridge imbalances between the amount of currency demanded and the amount
supplied by the free market in order to cushion the movements of the currency markets. They can also be used to
purchase assets that might be desirable investments or offer strategic returns. The process of accumulating
reserves is stimulative to the economy because it lessens the upward pressure on their own currency, which
allows a country to maintain stronger export competitiveness and puts more money in the economy. Since central
banks need to create more money to buy the foreign currency, doing that increases the amount of domestic
currency funds to either buy assets (causing asset prices to rise) or lend out.
At this juncture, the currency’s total return will be attractive because either a) those who want to buy what the
country has to offer need to sell their own currency and buy the local currency or b) the central bank will
increase the supply of its own currency and sell it for the foreign currency, which will make the country’s assets
go up when measured in its own currency. So, during this time when a country has a favorable balance of
payments, there is a net inflow of money that leads to the currency appreciating and/or the foreign-exchange

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 41

reserves increasing. This influx of money stimulates the economy and causes that country’s markets to rise.
Those invested in the country make money from the currency return (through a combination of currency price
changes and asset return differences) and/or the asset appreciation. The more the currency appreciates, the less
assets will appreciate.

2) The Bubble
The bubble emerges in the midst of a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle of strong capital flows, good asset returns,
and strong economic conditions. The capital that came in during the early upswing produced good returns, as it
was invested productively and led to asset price appreciation, which attracted even more capital. In the bubble
phase, the prices of the currency and/or the assets get bid up and increasingly financed by debt, making the
prices of these investments too high to produce adequate returns, but the borrowing and buying continues
because prices are rising, and so debts rise rapidly relative to incomes.
When there is a big wave of money coming into (and/or staying in) a country/currency, typically the exchange
rate is strong, foreign-exchange reserves increase, and the economy booms—or in some cases the currency rises a
lot and the economy grows more slowly. This upswing tends to be self-reinforcing until it is so overdone that it
reverses. It is self-reinforcing because the inflows drive up the currency, making it desirable to hold assets
denominated in it (and desirable to hold liabilities denominated in other currencies), and/or produce more money
creation that causes prices to rise more.
In either case, during these bubbles the total returns of these assets to foreigners (i.e., asset prices in local
currency plus the currency appreciation) are very attractive. That plus that country’s hot economic activity
encourage more foreign inflows and fewer domestic outflows. Over time, the country becomes the hot place to
invest, and its assets become overbought so debt and stock-market bubbles emerge. Investors believe the country’s
assets are a fabulous treasure to own and that anyone not in the country is missing out. Investors who were never
involved with the market rush in. When the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes ripe for a
reversal. In the bullets here and in the ones that follow, we show some key economic developments typically seen
as the bubble inflates.
••

Foreign capital flows are high (on average around 10 percent of GDP)

••

The central bank is accumulating foreign-exchange reserves

••

The real FX is bid up and becomes overvalued on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis by around 15 percent

••

Stocks rally (on average by over 20 percent for several years into their peak)

All sorts of entities build up structurally long currency positions because there is constant reward for doing that.
Most participants are motivated to be long the currency of the country that is enjoying a sustained wave of
investment into it—though they often find themselves in this position without explicitly taking it on or fully
recognizing it. For example, foreign businesses that set up operations in the hot country might fund their
activities with their own currency (to keep the liability in the currency that they expect will be weaker), but they
might prefer to hold their deposits in the local currency, and they might not hedge the currency exposures that
come from the revenues of sales in that country. Similarly, local businesses might borrow in the weaker foreign
currency, which the foreign bankers are eager to lend because the market is hot. There are lots of different ways
that a sustained bull market will lead to multinational entities getting long that local currency.
••

The influx of foreign capital finances a boom in consumption

••

Imports rise faster than exports, and the current account worsens

Meanwhile, investment in the country creates strong growth and rising incomes, which make borrowers in the
country more creditworthy, and make them more willing to borrow at the same time that lenders are more willing to
lend to them. High export prices, usually for commodities, increase the country’s income and incentivize investment.

42 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

As the bubble emerges, there are fewer productive investments, and at the same time there is more capital going
after them. The fundamental attractiveness of the country that sparked the boom fades, in part because the
rising currency is eroding the country’s competitiveness.
During this stage, growth is increasingly financed by debt rather than productivity gains, and the country
typically becomes highly reliant on foreign financing. This shows up in foreign currency denominated debt
rising. These emerging countries typically borrow primarily from abroad with debts denominated in foreign
currencies because of a combination of factors—including the local financial system not being well developed,
less faith in lending in the local currency, and a smaller stock of domestic savings available to be lent out. Asset
prices rise, and the economy is strong. This creates both higher levels of spending in the economy and higher
levels of obligations to pay in foreign currency in order to make debt-service payments. As with all debt cycles,
the positive effects come first and the negative effects come later.
••

Debt burdens rise fast. Debt to GDP rises at an annual rate of about 10 percent over three years.

••

Foreign-currency debt rises (on average to around 35 percent of total debt and to around 45 percent of
GDP).

••

Typically, the level of economic activity (i.e., the GDP gap) is very strong and growth is well above
potential, leading to tight capacity (as reflected in a GDP gap of around +4 percent).

The charts below convey what happens to debt and the current account in the average of the 27 inflationary
deleveraging cases (which we call the “archetype”). Just as I did with the deflationary deleveraging archetype
charts, I highlight each of the stages (with the “zero” point on the charts representing the top in economic
activity). Classically, during the bubble, debt as a percentage of GDP rises from around 125 percent to about 150
percent, and the current account deteriorates by about 2 percent of GDP.

During the bubble, the gap between the country’s income and its spending widens. The country requires an
increasing inflow of capital to drive continued growth in spending. But levels of economic activity can remain
strong at the top of the cycle only as long as continued inflows, motivated by expectations of continued high
growth, drive up asset prices and cause the currency to strengthen further. At this point, the country is increasingly fragile and even a minor event can trigger a reversal.

Below we summarize the conditions through the upswings that led to the 27 inflationary deleveragings we
looked at. We break out the cases with higher and lower levels of foreign-denominated debt and the cases that
eventually had the least and most extreme economic outcomes (as measured by most severe declines in growth
and equity prices and increases in unemployment and inflation). As you will see, the countries that were most
externally reliant through the upswing and experienced the biggest asset bubbles ultimately experienced the
most painful outcomes.

3) The Top and Currency Defense
The top-reversal/currency-defense occurs when the bubble bursts—i.e., when the flows that caused the bubble
and the high prices of the currency level, the high asset prices and the high debt growth rates finally become
unsustainable. This sets in motion a mirror-opposite cycle from what we saw in the upswing, in which weakening capital inflows and weakening asset prices cause deteriorating economic conditions, which in turn cause
capital flows and asset prices to weaken further. This spiral sends the country into a balance of payments crisis
and an inflationary depression.
Because at the top people are so invested in the optimistic scenario, and because that optimism is reflected in the
prices, even a minor event can trigger a slowing of foreign capital inflows and an increase in domestic capital
outflows. Though worsening trade balances typically play a role (usually because of the high currency level and
excessive domestic consumption that led to high imports), adverse shifts in capital flows are usually more important.
The circumstances that could set off such a crisis are akin to what might set off financial difficulties for a family or
individual—a loss of income or credit tightening, a big increase in costs (such as rising gasoline or heating oil prices),
or having borrowed so much that repayment becomes difficult. Any one of these shocks would create a gap between
the amount of money coming in and the amount of money being spent, which has to be closed somehow.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 45

In the typical cycle, the crisis arises because the unsustainable pace of capital that drove the bubble slows, but in
many cases, there is some sort of a shock (like a decline in oil prices for an oil producer). Generally the causes of
the top-reversal fall into a few categories:
1)

The income from selling goods and services to foreigners drops (e.g., the currency has risen to a point where
it’s made the country’s exports expensive; commodity-exporting countries may suffer from a fall in
commodity prices).

2) The costs of items bought from abroad or the cost of borrowing rises.
3) Declines in capital flows coming into the country (e.g., foreign investors reduce their net lending or net
investment into the country). This occurs because:
a)

The unsustainable pace naturally slows,

b) Something leads to greater worries about economic or political conditions, or
c) 	A tightening of monetary policy in the local currency and/or in the currency those debts are denominated
in (or in some cases, tightening abroad creates pressure for foreign capital to pull out of the country).
4) A country’s own citizens or companies want to get their money out of their country/currency.
Weakening capital flows are often the first shoe to drop in a balance of payments crisis. They directly cause
growth to weaken because the investment and consumption they had been financing is reduced. This makes
domestic borrowers seem less creditworthy, which makes foreigners less willing to lend and provide capital. So,
the weakening is self-reinforcing.
••

Growth slows relative to potential as the pace of capital inflows slows.

••

Domestic capital outflows pick up a bit.

••

Export earnings fall, due to falling prices or falling quantities sold. Typically exports are flat, no longer
rising.

The shift in capital and income flows drives asset prices down and interest rates up, slowing the economic
growth rates that were dependent on the inflows. This worsens the fundamentals of companies and further
drives out capital flows. The economy suffers a debt bust—asset prices fall and banks fail.
During this stage, worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and the policy makers who are trying
to support the currency. Asset/currency holders typically worry that policy makers will impose restrictions on their
ability to get their money out of the country, which encourages them to get their money out while they still can,
which further increases the balance of payments problem. Policy makers worry about capital outflows and the
possibility of a currency collapse. As the balance of payments deteriorate, the central bank’s job becomes more
difficult—i.e., it gets less economic growth per unit of inflation because the negative flows lead the currency to
depreciate, interest rates to rise, and/or reserves to decline, depending on how the central bank chooses to handle it.
At this stage, central banks typically try to defend their currencies by a) filling the balance of payments deficit by
spending down reserves and/or b) raising rates. These currency defenses and managed currency declines rarely
work because the selling of reserves and/or the raising of interest rates creates more of an opportunity for sellers,
while it doesn’t move the currencies and interest rates to the levels that they need to be to bring about sustainable economic conditions. Let’s look at this typical defense and why it fails.
There is a critical relationship between a) the interest rate difference and b) the spot/forward currency relationship. The amount the currency is expected to decline is priced into how much less the forward price is below the
spot price. For example, if the market expects the currency to fall by 5 percent over a year, it will need that
currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate. The math is even starker when depreciation is expected over
short periods of time. If the market expects a 5 percent depreciation over a month, than it will need that
currency to yield a 5 percent higher interest rate over that month—and a 5 percent monthly interest is equivalent
to an annual interest rate of about 80 percent10—a level that’s likely to produce a very severe economic contraction in an already weak economy. Because a small expected currency depreciation (say 5 to 10 percent in a year)
would equal a large interest rate premium (5 to 10 percent per year higher), this path is intolerable.
Said differently, a managed currency decline accompanied by falling reserves causes the market to expect
continued future currency depreciation, which pushes up domestic interest rates (as described above), acting as a
tightening at a time when the economy is already weak. Also, the expectation of continued devaluation will
encourage increased capital withdrawals and devaluation speculation, widening the balance of payments gap and
forcing the central bank to spend down more reserves to defend the currency (or abandon the planned gradual
depreciation). Also, a currency defense by spending reserves will have to stop because no sensible policy maker
will want to run out of such “savings.” In such currency defenses, policy makers—especially those defending a
10

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 47

peg—will typically make boldly confident statements vowing to stop the currency from weakening. All of these
things classically happen just before the cycle moves to its next stage, which is letting the currency go.
It is typical during the currency defense to see the forward currency price decline ahead of the spot price. This is
a consequence of the relationship between the interest rate differential and the spot/forward currency pricing
that I discussed above. To the extent that the country tightens monetary policy to try to support the currency,
they are just increasing the interest rate differential to artificially hold up the spot currency. While this supports
the spot, the forward will continue to decline relative to it. As a result, what you see is essentially a whip-like
effect, where the forward tends to lead the spot downward as the interest rate differential increases. The spot
then eventually catches up after the currency is let go, and the fall in the spot exchange rate allows the interest
differential to narrow, which mechanically causes the forward to rally relative to the spot.
At this point in the cycle, capital controls are a third (often last ditch) lever that seldom works. They can seem
attractive to policy makers, since they directly cause fewer people to take their capital out of the country. But
history shows that they usually fail because a) investors find ways to get around them and b) because the very act
of trying to trap people leads them to want to escape. The inability to get one’s money out of a country is analogous to one’s inability to get one’s money out of a bank: fear of it can lead to a run. Still, capital controls
sometimes can be a temporary fix, though in no case are they a sustained fix.
Usually, this currency defense phase of the cycle is relatively brief, in the vicinity of six months, with reserves
drawn down about 10 to 20 percent before the defense is abandoned.

4) The Depression (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)
As mentioned above, a country’s inflationary deleveraging is analogous to what happens when a family has
trouble making payments—with one major difference. Unlike a family, a country can change the amount of
currency that exists, and hence, its value. That creates an important lever for countries to manage balance of
payments pressures, and it’s why the world doesn’t have one global currency. Changing the value of the currency
changes the price of a country’s goods and services for foreigners at a different rate than it does for its citizens.
Think about it this way: if a family’s breadwinner lost his/her job and would have to take a 30 percent pay cut to
get a new one, that would have a devastating economic effect on the family. But when a country devalues its
currency by 30 percent, that paycut becomes a 30 percent pay cut only relative to the rest of the world; the wages
in the currency the family cares about stay the same. In other words, currency declines allow countries to offer
price cuts to the rest of the world (helping to bring in more business) without producing domestic deflation.
So after supporting the currency in unsustainable ways (i.e., expending reserves, tightening monetary policy,
making very strong assurances that there will not be a devaluation of the currency, and sometimes imposing
foreign exchange controls), policy makers typically stop fighting and let the currency decline (though they
generally try to smooth its fall).
Here is what we typically see after policy makers let the currency go:
••

The currency has a big initial depreciation, on average declining around 30 percent in real terms

••

The decline in the currency is not offset by tighter short rates, so that the losses from holding the currency
are significant (on average, around 30 percent in the first year)

••

Because the decline is very severe, policy makers try to smooth it, leading them to continue to spend down
reserves (on average, by another 10 percent for a year into the bust)

Central banks should not defend their currencies to the point of letting their reserves get too low or their interest
rates too high relative to what is good for the economy because the dangers those conditions pose are greater
than the dangers of devaluation. In fact, devaluations are stimulative for the economy and markets, which is
helpful during the economic contraction. The currency decline tends to cause assets to rise in value measured in
that weakened currency, stimulate export sales, and help the balance of payments adjustment by bringing
spending back in line with income. It also lowers imports (by making them more expensive), which favors
domestic producers, makes assets in that currency more competitively priced and attractive, creates better profit
margins for exported goods, and sets the stage for the country to earn more income from abroad (through
cheaper and more competitive exports).
But currency declines are double-edged swords; how policy makers manage them greatly impacts the amount of
pain the economy must endure during the adjustment. The nature of the currency decline greatly impacts how
much inflation increases and how the inflationary depression plays out. In all inflationary depressions, currency
weakness translates to higher prices for imported goods, much of which is passed on to consumers, resulting in a
sharp rise in inflation. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future
currency depreciation, which can encourage increased capital withdrawal and speculation, widening the balance
of payments gap. A continual devaluation also makes inflation more persistent, feeding an inflation psychology.

50 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

That’s why it’s generally better to have a large, one-off devaluation that gets the currency to a level where there’s
a two-way market for it (i.e., where there isn’t broad expectation that the currency will continue to weaken so
people are both buying and selling it). This means higher inflation is less likely to be sustained. And if the one-off
devaluation isn’t expected by the market (i.e., it’s a surprise), then policy makers won’t have to spend reserves
and/or allow interest rates to rise to defend the currency going into the devaluation. This is why policy makers
generally say they’ll continue to defend the currency right up until the moment they stop doing it.
After policy makers first let the currency go—stinging savers and creating expectations/fears of further devaluation—people push to get out of their positions in the currency. Many people had likely acquired big asset-liability
mismatches, taken on because they were profitable at the time. That makes the reversal self-sustaining, because
when the currency weakens, the mismatches all of a sudden go from being profitable to unprofitable.
When the capital is no longer available, the spending is forced to stop. Even those who aren’t borrowing from
abroad are impacted. Since one person’s spending is another person’s income, the effects ripple through the
economy, causing job losses and still less spending. Growth grinds to a halt. Lenders, especially domestic banks,
have debt problems. Foreigners become even less willing to lend and provide capital.
••

Typically capital inflows dry up, falling fast (by more than 5 percent of GDP in less than 12 months)

Typically the pullback in capital is not offset much by the central bank printing money, as printing risks enabling
more people to get out of the currency, worsening capital flight. Weaker growth causes investors to pull their
money out anyway; the assets that had been seen as a fabulous treasure a short time ago now look like trash.
They quickly go from overbought to oversold and prices plummet.
••

Nominal short rates rise (typically by about 20 percentage points) and the yield curve inverts.

••

Printing is limited (1 to 2 percent of GDP, on average).

••

Equities in local currency terms fall (on average by around 50%). They perform even worse in foreign
currency terms, as the currency decline exacerbates the equity sell-off.

One of the most important asset/liability mismatches is foreign-denominated debt. As their local currency depreciates, debtors who owe foreign currency debt face a rising debt burden (in local currency). There is not much that
borrowers can do, so they typically sell local currency to pay back debts, put on hedges, and move more savings into
foreign currency, all of which contributes further to the cycle of downward pressure on the local currency.
••

Debt service rises further (on average by more than 5 percent of GDP) because incomes fall and foreign
currency-denominated debt service becomes higher when measured in local currency, further squeezing
incomes and spending.

••

FX debt burdens rise on those who borrowed in foreign currency (debt-to-GDP rises on average by about
20 percent from the decline in incomes and the currency).

During this phase, the pendulum swings from most everything looking great to most everything looking terrible.
Different types of problems—debt, economic, political, currency, etc.—reinforce each other. Hidden problems like
fraudulent accounting and corruption typically come to the surface during such times. This bad environment
discourages foreign money from coming in and encourages domestic investors to get their money out of the country.
This is when countries usually “hit the bottom.” The bottom is the mirror opposite of the bubble stage. While
investors during the bubble are aggressively getting in, investors during the catharsis are aggressively getting
out. Those losing money in asset and currency positions flee from them in a panic; those who had been thinking
of getting in don’t want to go near the place—so a big supply/demand imbalance occurs in which a shortage of
buyers and surplus of sellers drive prices lower. This is the most severe and painful part of inflationary deleveraging, as the downward spiral is self-reinforcing and rapid. “Hitting bottom” is typically so painful that it
produces a radical metamorphosis in pricing and policies that ultimately produces the changes that are needed to
turn things around. That is why I use the word “catharsis” when describing hitting bottom. In theater (or for that
matter, in one’s own personal life) crisis sows the seeds for change and ultimately renewal.
Because the currency has become very cheap, spending on imports is finally cut substantially enough to restore
the balance of payments. That—plus, sometimes, international aid (e.g., from the IMF, BIS, and/or other multinational organizations)—creates the necessary adjustments. Often there are big political shifts, from those who had
been pursuing fundamentally bad policies to those who will pursue economically sound ones.
Here are some key economic developments that characterize this phase:
••

The level of economic activity (GDP gap) falls a lot (on average by about 8 percent)

••

Unemployment rises

••

The bottom in activity comes after about one year, with the trough in the GDP gap typically near -4 percent

The reversal and eventual return to normalcy comes when there is a balance between the supply and the demand
for the currency relative to those of other currencies. While this balance is partially made via trade adjustments,
it is typically more determined by capital flows, so it primarily comes when the central bank succeeds in making
it desirable to hold the currency again, and secondarily when spending and imports have fallen sufficiently to
bring about an adjustment in the balance of payments.
So how can policy makers keep capital in the country by making it desirable to be long—encouraging people to
lend and save in the currency and not to borrow in it? Most importantly, they need to produce a positive total
return for the currency at an acceptable interest rate (i.e., at an interest rate that isn’t too high for domestic
conditions). While most people, including most policy makers, think that the best thing they can do is defend the
currency during the currency defense phase, actually the opposite is true, because a currency level a) that is good
for the trade balance, b) that produces a positive total return, and that c) has an interest rate that is appropriate
for domestic conditions, is a low one.

54 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

As explained earlier, the best way to bring that about is to let the currency depreciate sharply and quickly. While
that will hurt those who are long that currency, it will make it more attractive for investors who will get long
after the devaluation, because the total return on holding the currency (i.e., the spot currency appreciation plus
the interest rate difference) is more likely to be positive, and at a sharply depreciated currency level it won’t take
an intolerably high interest rate to make the total return attractive. In other words, the best way to ensure that
investors expect positive total returns going forward at a relatively low real interest rate (which is what the weak
domestic conditions need) is to depreciate the currency enough.11
Both the balance of payments fundamentals and the central bank’s willingness to control “money printing” and
currency depreciations will determine whether the total return of the currency (i.e., the currency changes plus
interest rate differences) will be positive or negative, which will influence the willingness to own or be short the
currency. Devaluing currencies is like using cocaine, in that it provides short-term stimulation but is ruinous
when abused. It’s very important to watch what central banks do before you decide whether or not it’s prudent to
take a long position. If investors are burned with negative returns for too long and the currency keeps falling,
that’s frequently the break-point that determines if you’re going to have an inflationary spiral or not. The central
bank’s objective should be to allow the currency to get cheap enough that it can provide the needed stimulation
for the economy and the balance of payments, while running a tight enough policy to make the returns of owning
the currency attractive. As you can see in the chart below, returns to holding the currency for foreigners start out
negative, but then rally about a year after the devaluation.

Even if the country as a whole hasn’t hit its debt limits, frequently, certain entities within the country have, and
policy makers must recapitalize systemically important institutions and provide liquidity in a targeted way to
manage bad debts. By providing this targeted liquidity (typically by printing money) where needed, they can help
avoid a debt crisis that could be contractionary or could cause additional rounds of capital flight, but the inflationary nature of this money printing needs to be balanced carefully.

11

 hen it comes to determining whether or not to save in a credit instrument, the motivations of domestic investors are different than those of foreign investors. Domestic investors care
W
about the inflation rate relative to interest rates. For them, if inflation is high relative to the interest rates that they are getting to compensate them for it, they will move out of holding credit
instruments to holding inflation hedge assets (and vice versa). Foreign lenders just care about the rate of change in the currency relative to the interest rate change. So for policy makers
hoping to stabilize the balance of payments, inflation is a secondary consideration compared to ensuring that there are positive expected returns for saving in that currency. They have to get
the currency cheap enough so that it, with the desired interest rate, will produce a positive return.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 55

Here is what we typically see when the country reaches the bottom:
••

The collapse in imports improves the current account a lot (on average by about 8 percent of GDP).

••

Capital inflows stop declining and stabilize.

••

Capital flight abates.

••

Frequently, the country turns to the IMF or other international entities for support and a stable source of
capital, especially when its reserves are limited.

••

Short rates start to come down after about a year, but long rates continue to stay relatively elevated. After
peaking, short rates fall back to their pre-crisis levels in around two years. The decline in short rates is
stimulative.

••

As interest rates come down, the forward currency price rallies relative to the spot.

••

As the currency stabilizes, inflation comes down. Usually it takes nearly two years after the bottom for
inflation to reach pre-crisis levels.

Of course, these are all averages, and the actual amounts depend on each country’s particular circumstances
(which we will look at in the next section).
The sizable and painful decline in domestic conditions also helps to close the balance of payments gap by bringing
down spending and imports. Through the crisis, the average country’s imports contract by around 10 percent as
growth collapses and the equity market falls by over 50 percent. Classically, the collapse in imports brings the current
account into a surplus of 2 percent of GDP, rising from a deficit of -6 percent of GDP about 18 months into the crisis.
In the earlier stages of the crisis exports play a smaller role; they actually tend to contract during the worst of the
crisis (as other countries are sometimes seeing economic slowdowns too). They rebound in the subsequent years.

Below, we provide a summary of what well-managed and poorly managed versions of these adjustments looks like.
Well-Managed

Poorly Managed

• Policy makers bluff, conveying that they will never allow
the currency to weaken much. When they do devalue,
it’s a surprise.
• The devaluation is large enough that the people are no
longer broadly expecting the currency weakening more
(creating a two-way market).

• Policy makers are widely expected to allow a currency
weakness, causing more downward pressure on the
currency and higher interest rates.
• The initial devaluation is small, and further devaluations
are needed. The market expects this, causing higher
interest rates and inflation expectations.

Closing External • Tight monetary policy causes domestic demand to
Imbalances
contract in line with the fall in incomes.
• Policy makers create incentives for investors to stay in
the currency (i.e., higher interest rates that compensate
for risk of currency depreciation).

• Policy makers favor domestic conditions, and monetary
policy is too loose, putting off domestic pain and
stoking inflation.
• Policy makers attempt to stop the outflow of capital
with capital controls or other restrictive measures.

Smoothing the
Downturn

• Rely on reserve sales to maintain higher levels of
spending.

Managing
the Currency

• Use reserves judiciously to smooth the withdrawal of
foreign capital while working to close imbalances.

Managing Bad
• Work through debts of entities that are over-indebted,
Debts/Defaults
making up the gap with credit elsewhere.

• Allow disorderly defaults that lead to increased
uncertainty and capital flight.

Typically it takes a few years for the country to recover. Investors who were burned on their investments from
the last cycle are reluctant to return, so it can take some time before capital inflows become strongly positive. But
the price of domestic goods and domestic labor fell with the currency, so the country is an attractive destination
for foreign investment and the capital starts to come back. Together, higher exports and foreign direct investment kickstart growth. If policy makers protect and recapitalize critical financial institutions, the domestic
financial pipelines are in place to support a recovery. The country is back to the early part of the cycle and starts
a new virtuous cycle where productive investment opportunities attract capital, and capital drives up growth and
asset prices, which attracts more capital.
••

Incomes and spending pick up (usually after about one to two years).

••

It then takes several years (usually about three) from the bottom before the level of activity is back to
average.

••

The real FX is undervalued (typically by around 10 percent on a PPP basis) at the start of stabilization and
stays cheap.

••

Exports pick up a bit (by 1 to 2 percent of GDP).

••

Capital inflows start to return a few years later (on average four to five). Equities take about the same
amount of time to recover in foreign currency terms.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 57

The Spiral from a More Transitory Inflationary Depression to
Hyperinflation
While in many cases policy makers are able to engineer a recovery in which incomes and spending pick up and
inflation rates return to more typical levels (transitory balance of payments crises), a subset of inflationary
depressions do spiral into hyperinflations. Hyperinflations consist of extreme levels of inflation (goods and
services prices more than doubling every year or worse) coupled with extreme losses of wealth and severe
economic hardship. Because these cases are more common than one might think, it is worth walking through
how inflationary depressions spiral into hyperinflations.
The most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflations is that policy makers don’t
close the imbalance between external income, external spending, and debt service, and keep funding
external spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money. In some cases, it’s not voluntary. Weimar Germany had a crushing external debt service burden (war reparations) that for the most part
couldn’t be defaulted on. The amount of capital that needed to flow out of the country was so great that it was all
but destined that Weimar would face big inflation problems (see our case study for more color). In other cases,
policy makers choose to keep printing money to cover external spending—in effect, aiming to prop up growth
rather than bringing spending in line with income. If this is done repeatedly over years and on a large scale, a
country might face a hyperinflation that could have otherwise been avoided.
As stated earlier, contrary to popular belief, it’s not so easy to stop printing money during a crisis. Stopping
printing when capital is flowing out can cause an extreme tightness of liquidity and often a deep economic
contraction. And the longer the crisis goes on, the harder it becomes to stop printing money. For instance, in
Weimar Germany there was literally a shortage of cash because the hyperinflation meant that the existing stock
of money could buy less and less. (By late October 1923, toward the end of the crisis, Germany’s entire 1913 stock
of money would have just about gotten you a one-kilo loaf of rye bread.) To stop printing would have meant there
was so little cash that commerce would have virtually ground to a halt (at least until they came up with an
alternate currency). In an inflation spiral, printing money can seem like the prudent choice at the time—but
continuing to print money time and time again feeds the inflation spiral until there is no way out.

How the Spiral Plays Out
Over time, as the currency declines and printing is used more and more, people begin to shift their behavior and
an inflationary psychology sets in. Currency declines inspire additional capital flight, which causes an escalating
feedback loop of depreciation, inflation, and money printing. Eventually, the linkages that drove growth in earlier
rounds decline and money printing become less effective.
With each round of printing, more of the printed money is transferred to real or foreign assets instead
of being spent on goods and services that fuel economic activity. Since investors that shorted cash and
bought real/foreign assets were repeatedly better off than those who saved and invested domestically, domestic
currency holders shift from investing the printed money in productive assets to real assets (like gold) and foreign
currency, in order to hedge inflation and a deterioration in their real wealth. Foreign investors stay away. Because
the economy is weak and investors are buying real assets, stocks suffer and no longer provide the wealth effect
that drove earlier rounds of spending. The result is a currency devaluation that doesn’t stimulate growth. This
dynamic is important to inflationary deleveragings, so we’ll walk through it in detail.

When continual currency declines lead to persistent inflation, it can become self-reinforcing in a way that
nurtures inflation psychology and changes investor behavior. A key way this occurs is when inflation pressures
spread to wages and produce a wage-cost spiral. Workers demand higher wages to compensate for their reduced
purchasing power. Compelled to raise wages, producers increase their prices to compensate. Sometimes this
happens mechanically because of wage indexing—contracts in which employers agree to increase wages with
inflation. As is normal in such cases of price and wage indexing, a vicious cycle is established: the currency
depreciates, internal prices rise, the increase of the quantity of paper money once more lowers the value of the
currency, prices rise once more, and so on.
With each successive currency decline, savers and investors also change their behavior. Savers, who were burned
before, now move to protect their purchasing power. They are quicker to short cash and buy foreign and physical
assets.
As inflation worsens, bank depositors understandably want to be able to get their funds on short notice, so they
shorten their lending to banks. Deposits move to short-term checking accounts rather than longer-term savings.
Investors shorten the duration of their lending, or stop lending entirely, because they are worried about risks of
default or getting paid back in worthless money. During inflationary deleveragings, average debt maturities
always fall.
It’s also cheap to short cash, as higher inflation and money printing lower real interest rates, so the withdrawal
of capital and faster borrowing cause illiquidity in the financial system. Banks find it practically impossible to
meet the demand for cash. No longer able to fulfill their contracts because of cash shortages, businesses also
suffer. At this point the choice for central banks, who remember the benefits of the previous round of currency
declines, is between extreme illiquidity and printing money at an accelerating rate, and the path is again
obvious—i.e., to print. They provide liquidity by printing money to support the banks, and often lending directly
to businesses. When interest rates are insufficient to compensate for future currency declines, this provision of
liquidity provides the funds that enable investors to continue to borrow and invest abroad and in inflation hedges
(like real assets or gold), which further contributes to the inflation and depreciation spiral.
Because much of the country’s debt is denominated in a foreign currency, debt burdens rise when the currency
falls, which requires spending cuts and asset sales. While this effect was originally overcome by the stimulation
of the falling currency, it becomes increasingly devastating as that effect fades and the debt burden grows. These
higher debt burdens also mean foreign investors want higher interest rates as compensation for the risk of
default. This means that currency declines and inflation often increase debt service and debt burdens, making it
even harder to stimulate through the currency.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 59

Many governments respond to rising debt burdens by raising taxes on income and wealth. With their net worths
already eroding because of the bad economy and their failing investments, the wealthy desperately try to
preserve their rapidly shrinking wealth at all costs. This leads to extremely high rates of tax evasion and
increases the flight of capital abroad. This is typical in deleveragings.
As growth weakens further, the lack of foreign lending shuts down an important source of credit creation. And
while there is a lot of domestic credit creation and borrowing, this borrowing does not result in much growth
because so much of it is spent abroad on foreign assets. Of the spending that does occur locally, much of it doesn’t
contribute to GDP. For example, investors buy lots of gold, factories, or imports (even rocks in the case of the
Weimar Republic!) as store holds of wealth. Capital investments like machinery and tools are purchased as stores
of value, not because they were needed.
It’s easy to see how these forces can create a feedback mechanism that causes inflation and currency declines to
escalate until people completely lose faith in the currency. Money loses its role as a store of value (and people
hold at most a few days’ reserves). The long list of zeros also makes it an impossible unit of account. Money also
breaks down as a medium of exchange, because the currency instability makes producers unwilling to sell their
products for domestic currency, and producers often demand payment in foreign currencies or barter. Because
there is a shortage of foreign exchange, illiquidity reaches its peak and demand collapses. This form of illiquidity
can’t be relieved by money printing. Stores close and unemployment rises. As the economy enters hyperinflation,
it contracts rapidly because the currency declines that were once beneficial now just create chaos.
In addition to causing an economic contraction, hyperinflation wipes out financial wealth as financial assets fail
to keep pace with currency depreciation and inflation. Hyperinflation also causes extreme wealth redistributions. Lenders see their wealth get inflated away, as do debtor’s liabilities. Economic contraction, extreme wealth
redistributions, and chaos create political tensions and clashes. Frequently public servants like police officers go
on strike because they don’t want to work for worthless paper money. Disorder, crime, looting, and violence
typically reach their peak during this phase. In Weimar Germany, the government had to respond to the disorder
by issuing a “state of siege,” granting military authorities greater power over domestic policies such as carrying
out arrests and breaking up demonstrations.
Investing during a hyperinflation has a few basic principles: get short the currency, do whatever you can to get
your money out of the country, buy commodities, and invest in commodity industries (like gold, coal, and metals).
Buying equities is a mixed bag: investing in the stock market becomes a losing proposition as inflation transitions
to hyperinflation. Instead of there being a high correlation between the exchange rate and the price of shares,
there is an increasing divergence between share prices and the exchange rate. So, during this time gold becomes
the preferred asset to hold, shares are a disaster even though they rise in local currency, and bonds are wiped out.
Once an inflationary deleveraging spirals into hyperinflation, the currency never recovers its status as a store
hold of wealth. Creating a new currency with very hard backing while phasing out the old currency is the classic
path that countries follow in order to end inflationary deleveragings.

60 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

War Economies
War economies are totally different from regular economies in terms of what happens with the production,
consumption, and accounting for goods, services, and financial assets. For example, the increasing GDP arising
from the greater production of armaments which get destroyed in the war, the reduced unemployment rate due to
increases in military service, shifts in production and profitability arising from the top-down allocation of
resources, and the nature of borrowing, lending, and other capital flows are not the same as in periods of peace so
understanding these statistics requires a whole different orientation. Trying to adequately convey how war
economies work would take a whole different book, so I’m not going to delve deeply into the subject now, but I will
touch on them briefly because they certainly are important in understanding the big debt crises that were
captured within our sampling period—and they are very important to understand if we enter another war period.
The economic/geopolitical cycle of economic conflicts leading to military conflicts both within and between
emerging powerful countries and established powerful countries is obvious to anyone who studies history. It’s
been well-described by historians, though those historians typically have more of a geopolitical perspective and
less of an economic/market perspective than I do. In either case, it is well-recognized as classic by historians.
The following sentence describes it as I see it in a nutshell:
When 1) within countries there are economic conflicts between the rich/capitalist/political right and
the poor/proletariat/political left that lead to conflicts that result in populist, autocratic, nationalistic,
and militaristic leaders coming to power, while at the same time, 2) between countries there are
conflicts arising among comparably strong economic and military powers, the relationships between
economics and politics become especially intertwined—and the probabilities of disruptive conflicts (e.g.,
wars) become much higher than normal.
In other words economic rivalries within and between countries often lead to fighting in order to establish which
entities are most powerful. In these periods, we have war economies, and after them, markets, economies, and
geopolitics all experience the hang-over effects. What happens during wars and as a result of wars have huge
effects on which currencies, which debts, which equities, and which economies are worth what, and more
profoundly, on the whole social-political fabric. At the most big-picture level, the periods of war are followed by
periods of peace in which the dominant power/powers get to set the rules because no one can fight them. That
continues until the cycle begins again (because of a rival power emerging).
Appreciating this big economic/geopolitical cycle that drives the ascendancies and declines of empires and their
reserve currencies requires taking a much longer (250-year) time frame, which I will touch on briefly here and in
more detail in a future report.
Typically, though not always, at times of economic rivalry, emotions run high, firebrand populist leaders who
prefer antagonistic paths are elected or come to power, and wars occur. However, that is not always the case.
History has shown that through time, there are two broad types of relationships, and that what occurs depends
on which type of relationship exists. The two types of relationships are:
a) Cooperative-competitive relationships in which the parties take into consideration what’s really
important to the other and try to give it to them in exchange for what they most want. In this type of winwin relationship, there are often tough negotiations that are done with respect and consideration, like two
friendly merchants in a bazaar or two friendly teams on the field.
b) Mutually threatening relationships in which the parties think about how they can harm the other and
exchange painful acts in the hope of forcing the other into a position of fear so that they will give in. In this
type of lose-lose relationship, they interact through “war” rather than through “negotiation.”
Either side can force the second path (threatening war, lose-lose) onto the other side, but it takes both sides to go
down the cooperative, win-win path. Both sides will inevitably follow the same approach.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 61

In the back of the minds of all parties, regardless of which path they choose, should be their relative powers. In
the first case, each party should realize what the other could force on them and appreciate the quality of the
exchange without getting too pushy, while in the second case, the parties should realize that power will be
defined by the relative abilities of the parties to endure pain as much as their relative abilities to inflict it. When
it isn’t clear exactly how much power either side has to reward and punish the other side because there are many
untested ways, the first path is the safer way. On the other hand, the second way will certainly make clear—
through the hell of war—which party is dominant and which one will have to be submissive. That is why, after
wars, there are typically extended periods of peace with the dominant country setting the rules and other
countries following them for the time it takes for the cycle to happen all over again.
In terms of economic policy, during a war period, the most important priority is to maintain one’s access to
financial and non-financial resources that are required to sustain a good war effort. Because no country has the
capacity to both fund a war and sustain tolerable non-war-related spending out of current income, one must have
access to borrowing and/or have very large foreign exchange reserves. The access to borrowing very much
depends on each county’s creditworthiness and the development of its capital markets, especially the soundness
of its own local currency debt market. Similarly, maintaining access to the critical non-financial resources that
are required to sustain both the war effort and acceptable domestic economic conditions is essential during the
war period.
After the war period, during the paying back period, the market consequences of the debts and the outcome of
the war (whether it is won or lost) will be enormous. The worst thing a country, hence a country’s leader,
could ever do is get into a lot of debt and lose a war because there is nothing more devastating. ABOVE
ALL ELSE, DON’T DO THAT. Look at what it meant for Germany after World War I in the 1920s (which
is explained in Part 2) and for Germany and Japan after World War II in the late 1940s and the 1950s.
The following charts show some of the typical shifts in the economy—how countries shift much of their economies to
war production, borrow a lot of money to finance big fiscal deficits, and move much of their workforces to the armed
services and war production. The first chart shows the rapid rise in government spending relative to private spending. The subsequent charts show the increase in military spending and the number of soldiers, averaging a number of
war cases—both military spending and number of soldiers as a percent of the population increase by around five
times. For instance, during World War II, 20 percent of the US workforce shifted to the military.

After a major war ends, all countries—both the winners and losers—are saddled with debt and the need to transition
from a war-economy to a more normal economy. The big contraction of military spending usually causes a postwar
recession, as factories are retooled once again and the large number of people formerly employed in the war effort
need to find new jobs. Countries typically enter periods of deleveraging, working through the big war debts with the
same basic dynamics visible in other depressions/deleveragings coming into play here too. However, losers of war
experience significantly worse economic conditions. The following charts demonstrate this dynamic. Losers experience a much deeper depression, resort to more money printing, meaningfully spend down their savings/reserves, and
see much higher inflation rates (sometimes experiencing hyperinflation).

That’s all I have to convey about war economies at this stage. For more color on them, I suggest you read the
Weimar Germany and US Great Depression case studies in Part 2, as the first paints a good picture of a postwar
period for a war loser and the second shows how economic conflicts initiate a sequence of events that lead to
shooting wars. I also suggest that you also look at the charts of the US and UK in the post-World War II periods
(two examples of winners of wars). The reasons we don’t have charts for Germany, Japan, and other war losers
for the post-World War II period is that the consequences for their currencies, other markets, and economies
were so devastating that statistics were either ridiculously unreliable or unavailable.

In Summary
I want to reiterate my headline: managing debt crises is all about spreading out the pain of the bad
debts, and this can almost always be done well if one’s debts are in one’s own currency. The biggest risks
are typically not from the debts themselves, but from the failure of policy makers to do the right things
due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority. If a nation’s debts are in a foreign currency, much
more difficult choices have to be made to handle the situation well—and, in any case, the consequences
will be more painful.
As I know from personal experience, the understandings and authorities of policy makers varies a lot across
countries, which can lead to dramatically different outcomes, and they tend not to react forcefully enough until
the crisis is extreme. Their authorities vary as a function of how powerful each country’s regulatory and checksand-balance systems are. In countries where these systems are strong (which brings lots of benefits), there is also
the risk that some required policy moves can’t get done because they are inconsistent with the rigid rules and
agreements that are in place.
It’s impossible to write the rules well enough to anticipate all the possibilities, and even the most knowledgeable
and empowered policy maker is unlikely to manage a crisis perfectly. Circumstances that weren’t foreseen must
be responded to instantly, often in hours, within a legal/regulatory system that doesn’t have crystal-clear rules.
The checks and balances system—normally a critical protection from too much concentration of power—can
exacerbate a crisis because it can slow decision making and allow those with narrower interests to block necessary policy moves. Policy makers who try to take the necessary bold actions are typically criticized from all sides.
Politics is horrendous during debt crises, and distortions and outright misinformation are pervasive.
While these big debt crises can be devastating to some people and countries over the short- to medium-term
(meaning three to ten years), in the long run they fade in importance relative to productivity, which is more forceful
(though less apparent because it is less volatile). The political consequences (e.g., increases in populism) that result
from these crises can be much more consequential than the debt crises themselves. The charts below show real
GDP per capita and help to put these big debt crises (and the “little” ones that we call recessions) in perspective.
The contractions of more than 3 percent are shown in the shaded areas. Note how the growth rates over time were
64 Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

far more important than the bumps along the way. The biggest bumps came more as a result of wars than the worst
depressions (though a case can be made that those wars were caused by the political fallout from those depressions).

German Debt Crisis and
Hyperinflation (1918–1924)
This section provides a detailed account of the most iconic inflationary depression cycle in history—the German debt crisis and hyperinflation that followed
the end of World War I and carried into the mid-1920s, which set the stage for
the economic and political changes of the 1930s. Much like my accounts of the
2008 US Financial Crisis and the 1930s Great Depression, this study goes
through the particulars of the case in some detail with reference to the template
laid out earlier in the “Archetypal Inflationary Depression.” Although the
German hyperinflation took place almost a century ago, and amid exceptional
political circumstances (Germany’s defeat in the First World War and the
imposition of a huge reparation burden on it by the Allies), the basic dynamic of
debt cycles, economic activity, and markets described in the template drove
what happened. Noting the differences between this inflationary depression
case (and other inflationary depression cases) and the deflationary depression
cases highlights what makes some inflationary and others deflationary. To
provide a vivid sense of what was happening in real time, a newsfeed runs along
the sides of my description of what happened.

July 1914–November 1918: World War I
World War I (July 1914–November 1918) set the stage for this big, dramatic cycle.
During the war years Germany left the gold standard, accumulated a large stock
of domestic and foreign debts, began the practice of money printing to finance
its ever-growing fiscal deficits, and experienced its first bout of currency
depreciation and inflation. Based on their experience of the Franco-Prussian
War of 1870, the Germans had expected the war to be short, and they assumed it
would ultimately be paid for by large indemnities levied on the defeated Allied
powers. Instead it turned out to be an extremely long and expensive affair that
was financed primarily through domestic debt, and Germany ended up having
to pay a huge war reparation bill rather than collecting on one.

$730,000,000.”

This was a classic case of war debts being built up by a country that then loses
the war (though more extreme than most) and is also a classic case of a
country with large foreign currency denominated debt that is held by foreign
creditors. Knowing the dynamic described in the “Archetypal Inflationary
Depression” section of Part 1, you should have a pretty good idea of how this
story will play out.

Background
Like most countries at the time, Germany had been on the gold standard at the
beginning of the war. All paper currency, including all government debt, was
convertible to gold at a fixed rate. However, by 1914, the central bank did not
have enough gold to back the stock of money in circulation at the fixed price,1 as
one might expect. As soon as the war broke out, smart German citizens rushed
to exchange their paper money for bullion, which caused a run on the banking
system. Within a matter of weeks, the central bank (the Reichsbank) and the
Treasury had paid out 195 million marks’ worth of gold to the public (i.e., about
10 percent of total gold reserves).2 In order to prevent further losses, ensure
liquidity in the banking system, and avoid a major contraction in the money

This is classic. Currency is both a medium of exchange and a store hold of
wealth. When investors hold a lot of promises to deliver currency (i.e., a lot of
debt denominated in a currency) and the supply of that currency is tied to
something that backs it, the ability of the central bank to produce currency is
limited. When investors want to convert their bonds to currency/money and
spend it, that puts the central bank in the difficult position of having to choose
between having a lot of debt defaults or floating a lot of currency, which can
debase its value. So, whenever (a) the amount of money in circulation is
much greater than the amount of gold held in reserves to back the
money at the designated price of conversion, and (b) investors are
rushing to convert money into gold because they are worried about the
value of their money, the central bank is in the untenable position of
either reducing the supply of money in circulation (i.e., tighten credit)
or ending convertibility and printing more money. Central banks almost
always choose suspending convertibility and printing more money versus
allowing a credit contraction to take place, because it’s less painful.
Printing a lot of money and depreciating the value of a currency causes just
about anything denominated in that depreciated money to go up in price, and
people like it when the things they own go up in value and they have more
money to spend. This is also true in times of war. Policy makers attempting to
marshal the economic resources of the country toward the war effort print
money to give themselves more to spend. This printing helps prevent a
liquidity crisis in the banking system or an economic contraction from taking
place—either of which would be very disruptive to the war effort. It is for this
reason that most of the countries fighting in WWI ended up suspending the
gold standard at one point or another.
Fighting the war required the German government to significantly increase
expenditures (government spending as a share of GDP would increase 2.5x
between 1914 and 1917). Financing this spending would mean either raising
new revenues (i.e., taxation) or increasing government borrowing. As there
was huge resistance to increasing taxation at home, and as Germany

was mostly locked out of international lending markets, the war had to
be financed by issuing domestic debt. 5 In 1914, German government debt
was insignificant. By 1918, Germany had amassed a total local currency debt

Although this stock of debt was huge, prior to the German surrender and the
imposition of war reparations, most of it was denominated in local currency.6
Policy makers recognized that this was a good thing. According to the
Reichsbank, “the greatest weakness in the war financing of the enemies is
their growing indebtedness abroad [particularly to the US],”7 as it forces them
to scramble for dollars when needing to make debt-service payments. In
contrast, most German debt taken on to finance the war (prior to reparations)
was in local currency and financed by Germans.8
Up until the second half of 1916, the German public was both willing and able to
finance the entire fiscal deficit by purchasing government debt.9 In fact, war
bond issuances were regularly oversubscribed. However, as the war dragged on
and inflation accelerated, the Treasury found that the public was no longer
prepared to hold all the debt it was issuing. This was partly due to the size of the
deficit, increasing substantially as the war progressed, but also because wartime
inflation had caused real interest rates to become very negative (government war
bonds paid out a fixed interest rate of 5 percent throughout the war, whereas
inflation had climbed above 30% by early 1915), which resulted in lenders not
being adequately compensated for holding government debt.10 The inflation was
being driven by wartime disruptions and shortages, capacity constraints in key
war industries, and currency weakness (the mark would fall about 25 percent
against the dollar by 1916).11 While some naive lenders clung to the hope that the
government would return to the gold standard at the old exchange rate once the
war was over, or compensate them for any losses due to inflation, others feared
they would most likely be paid in money that had lost most of its purchasing
power, so they ran out of debt denominated in that currency.12

The currency remained an effective medium of exchange while losing its effectiveness as a store hold of wealth.
So, the government borrowed money to pay for its war expenditures, and the Reichsbank was forced to monetize
the debt as investors came up short in supplying the money. This had the effect of increasing the money supply
by an amount equal to the fiscal deficit not financed by the public. As debt monetization is inflationary
(there is more money in the economy chasing the same quantity of goods and services), a self-reinforcing spiral ensued—i.e., debt monetization increased inflation, which reduced real interest rates, which
discouraged lending to the government, which encouraged additional debt monetization. As the deficit
was huge (averaging about 40 percent of GDP between 1914 and 1918), this led to the money supply increasing by
almost 300 percent over the course of the war.13
The pace of money creation accelerated after 1917 as German citizens became increasingly unwilling to purchase
government debt, and the central bank was forced to monetize a growing share of the deficit.14 Although the number
of marks in circulation almost doubled between mid-1917 and mid-1918, it did not cause a material decline in the
currency. In fact, the mark rallied over this period as Russia’s withdrawal increased expectations of a German
victory. The mark only began falling in the second half of 1918, as a German defeat began looking increasingly likely.15

In the last two years of the war, the German government began borrowing in foreign currencies because lenders
were unwilling to take promises to pay in marks.16 When a country has to borrow in a foreign currency, it’s a bad
sign. By 1918, the Reichsbank and private firms each owed about 2.5 billion gold marks in FX to external
lenders.17 A gold mark was an artificial unit used to measure the value of a paper mark to gold. In 1914, one gold
mark equaled one paper mark.18 A debt of 5 billion gold marks was therefore a debt denominated in gold, with the
bill equal to the amount of gold that could be purchased by 5 billion marks in 1914.
Unlike local currency debt, hard currency (foreign currency and gold denominated) debt cannot be printed
away. Debtors would have to get their hands on either gold or foreign exchange to meet these liabilities. While the
hard currency debt was less than 10 percent of the total debt stock, it was still larger than the entire public gold

reserves of the Reich.19 The hope was that once Germany won the war, the mark would appreciate, making those debt
burdens more manageable. And, of course, the losing countries would be forced to pay for most of Germany’s foreign
and domestic debts.20
Policy makers recognized that if Germany lost the war, or failed to extract large reparations, it would be
extremely difficult to pay back these debts with hard money. According to the president of the Reichsbank,
Rudolf Havenstein, covering those debts “will be extraordinarily difficult if we do not get a large war indemnity.”21 According to the German economist Edgar Jaffé, unless England paid between a third and a half of
Germany’s war costs, the result would be the “monstrous catastrophe” of “currency collapse” once German
citizens learned that domestic debts would likely be paid in depreciated money, and government agencies and
private firms scrambled to get their hands on foreign exchange to pay off external liabilities.22
Breaking the peg to gold and monetizing an ever-growing fiscal deficit, combined with wartime economic
disruptions and shortages, led to a declining exchange rate and a pickup in inflation. By the beginning of 1918,
the mark had lost about 25 percent of its value versus the dollar and prices had tripled.
However, in the context of WWI, this was pretty typical—i.e., it’s what most countries did to fund their wars. German
inflation, while high, was not significantly higher than that of other war participants, as you can see in the chart
below.23 But only a few of the war’s many participants ended up with hyperinflation, for reasons I will soon explain.

I bring up this point to underline the fact that WWI (and the accompanying monetization of debt) did not directly
cause Germany’s postwar inflationary depression. As mentioned in the archetype template, while inflationary

acquired, and it was very likely that the Allies would force Germany to pay
them an additional sum in war reparations. Foreign exchange reserves were
not sufficient to meet the existing stock of external debts, let alone any
additional reparation payments. Real interest rates were very negative, and
offered little compensation to creditors holding German currency/debt. The
budget and the trade balance were also in very large deficits, meaning that
Germany would remain dependent on borrowing/monetization to finance
expenditures and consumption. Finally, the experience of high inflation,
money printing, and negative total returns in holding the mark had begun to
reduce trust in the German currency/debt as a store hold of value.

November 1918–March 1920: 			
The Treaty of Versailles and the First
Inflation
News of the German surrender in November 1918 was met with a wave of
capital flight out of Germany. German citizens and firms rushed to convert
their wealth into the currencies and assets of the victorious powers, not
knowing what the terms of the peace would be or exactly how the German
government would pay for its massive stock of liabilities now that it had lost
the war. Over the next few months, the mark declined about 30 percent
against the dollar, the German stock market lost almost half its real value, and
government debt in local currency rose by about 30 percent, almost all of
which had to be monetized by the central bank. As a result, the money supply
grew by about 50 percent and the inflation rate climbed to 30 percent.

This capital flight occurred despite initial optimism that the final terms of the
peace would not be particularly harsh. Many members of the German negotiation team hoped that reparations would be limited to damage done in territories
occupied by German forces, and would be paid primarily in goods instead of
currency.24 US President Woodrow Wilson’s emphasis on self-determination also
led many Germans to believe that there would be no annexations of German
territory without at least a referendum. Many Germans therefore expected that
their country would come out of the war with its territory and economic capacity
intact, and that the reparation burden would not be too vindictive.25
When the final terms of the Treaty of Versailles were revealed, they came as a
huge shock. Germany was to lose 12 percent of its territory through

12

Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

annexations, 10 percent of its population, 43 percent of its pig-iron capacity,
and 38 percent of its steel capacity.26 Germany was also required to compensate Allied citizens for all wealth seized during the war (within Germany and
in occupied territories), but it would receive no compensation for its own
assets (both real and financial) that had been confiscated abroad. The German
government would also have to honor all prewar debts to Allied creditors,
even if they were the debts of private citizens. As for reparations, a commission was to be established in 1921 that would determine the final bill after
evaluating Germany’s capacity to pay and giving its government another
chance to be heard on the subject. In the interim, Germany would pay an
equivalent of 20 billion marks in gold, commodities, ships, securities, and
other real assets to compensate the Allies for the costs of occupation.27
Germany had no option but to agree to these terms or face total occupation. It
signed the treaty on June 28, 1919. This triggered another sharp plunge in the
exchange rate,28 with the mark falling 90 percent against the dollar between
July, 1919 and January, 1920. Inflation surged, hitting 140 percent by the end
of the year. Once again, the mark’s drop was driven primarily by German
citizens rushing to get their capital out of the country because they
justifiably feared that these promises to deliver currency (i.e., these
debt obligations) would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the
German government to meet its liabilities with hard money. To do that,
the Reich would have to levy extortionately high taxes and confiscate
private wealth. As the real wealth of private citizens was at risk, getting
out of the currency and the country made sense.

As the mark fell, German debtors with external liabilities saw the real
expenses of their debts soar. They rushed to pay off as many of their
foreign debts as they could, flooding the foreign exchange market. This
further weakened the mark, triggering additional rounds of capital flight. This
dynamic is also very common in countries with large foreign currency denominated debt during a debt/balance of payments crisis. As a prominent Hamburg
industrialist noted at the time, “We are driving ourselves to destruction if
everyone now…secretly sells mark notes in order to be able to meet his obligations. If things keep on this way, the mark notes will become unusable.”29
To be clear: at this point money printing was not the source of the
currency weakness so much as currency weakness was the cause of
money printing. In other words, capital flight from the currency and
the country was driving the currency down, which in turn helped drive
higher inflation. That’s classically how inflationary depressions happen.

contribute to the raising of a new Germany on
the ruins of war.”

Naturally, as money leaves a currency/debt market, that puts the central bank
in the position of having to choose between a) allowing the liquidity and debt
markets to tighten up a lot and b) printing money to fill in the void. Central
banks typically print money to fill the void, which causes currencies to
decline. While currency declines hurt importers and those with debts in
foreign currencies, devaluations are stimulative for the economy and its
asset markets, which is helpful during a period of economic weakness.
Currency declines provide a boost to exports and profit margins, as they make
a country’s goods cheaper on international markets. Simultaneously, they
make imports more expensive, supporting domestic industries. Devaluations
also cause assets to rise in value when measured in local currency, and they
attract capital from abroad as a country’s financial assets become cheaper in
global currency terms.
From July 1919 through March 1920, the decline in the mark and negative real
rates provided a boost to the German economy and its equity and commodity
markets.

The export industry also thrived, unemployment declined, and as real wages
remained low, business profitability improved. You can see the decline in
unemployment and the pickup in exports in the charts below. (Note that all
unemployment statistics from the time only show unemployment among trade
union members, so they likely understate the true amount of unemployment
and hardship in German society. However, they do show that employment
conditions were improving.)

There was also the hope that by encouraging exports and discouraging imports,
the mark’s decline would be a one-off and would help bring the German balance
of payments into equilibrium. According to one prominent German official:
14 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

“I regard our gravely ailing currency as an admirable means of dispelling the
hatred felt abroad towards Germany, and of overcoming the reluctance to trade
with us by our enemies. The American who no longer gets for his dollar 4.21
marks worth of goods from us, but 6.20 marks worth, will rediscover his fondness
for Germany.”30
German policy makers also began considering ways to deal with the domestic
debt burden and the fiscal deficit. As one official described policy since the end
of the war, “All we have done is keep printing.”31 To reduce the deficit, and raise
revenues to meet debt liabilities, a comprehensive tax-reform package was
proposed by finance minister Matthias Erzberger. Known as the “Erzberger
Financial Reform,” the package would transfer from the “haves” to the
“have-nots” by levying highly progressive taxes on income and wealth (with top
rates for income approaching 60 percent, and those for wealth at 65 percent).32
Passed in December 1919, the Erzberger Reforms would go on to increase the
share of the Reich’s income coming from direct taxes to 75 percent (the 1914
figure had been about 15 percent) and raise enough revenue to pay for all
government expenditures except reparations by 1922.33 Prior to these reforms,
the majority of the government revenue came from public enterprises (primarily railroads), as well as specific duties on exports, imports, and coal.
The beneficial results of currency weakness led many German policy makers to
advocate relying on currency weakness and inflation (from rising import prices
and central bank printing) as an effective alternative to “confiscatory
taxation.”34 One such official was Dr. Friedrich Bendixen, who argued that
“every effort to collect the monstrous sum through taxes will weaken our
productivity and thus reduce receipts and drive the Reich to economic
collapse…only the transformation of the war loans into money can bring
salvation.”35 Inflation would “cleanse” Germany of its local currency war debts
and allow it to “begin a new life on the basis of new money.” Although this
program was explicitly rejected by the central bank, it recognized that things
might “develop along these lines anyway.” They did: inflation climbed to
almost 200 percent, and by the end of 1919 it had reduced the domestic
war-debt burden to about 25 percent of its original 1918 value. As you might
imagine, those with wealth scrambled to buy foreign currencies or real assets
to prevent their wealth from being either inflated or taken away.36

The central bank’s alternative to allowing inflation to “naturally”

engineer a deflationary recession. This would allow the Reich to pay back its citizens something closer to the
true value of their loaned wealth, but it would also crush domestic credit creation and demand, generating
significant unemployment. Germany faced the classic dilemma: whether to help those who are long the
currency (i.e., creditors who hold debt denominated in it) or those who are short it (i.e., debtors who
owe it). In economic crises, policies to redistribute wealth from “haves” to “have-nots” are more likely
to occur. This is because the conditions of the “have-nots” become intolerable and also because there
are more “have-nots” than “haves.”
At the time, relieving debt burdens and redistributing wealth were higher priorities than preserving the wealth
of creditors. Unemployment was still high, food shortages were rampant, and a large mass of returning soldiers
from the front needed jobs so they could be reintegrated into the economy. Clashes between capitalists and
workers, as are typical in depressions, were also happening all across Europe. There had been a Communist
revolution in Russia in 1917, and Communist ideas were spreading around the world. Commenting on the choice
between inflation and deflation at the time, the legendary British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote: “The
inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse, because it is worse in
an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier [i.e., the capitalist lender].”37
Although levels of activity remained very depressed, by late 1919/early 1920 Germany had inflated away most of
its domestic debt, passed a comprehensive tax-reform package to generate new revenues, and was beginning to
see a pickup in economic activity. There was also some good news on the reparations front. To relieve growing
tensions between Germany and the Allies, the Allies invited Germany to submit its own proposal for how much
the reparation bill should be. Critics of a harsh settlement, such as John Maynard Keynes, were finding increasing sympathy in official circles abroad. The exchange rate also began to stabilize.38
However, conflicts between the Left and Right remained intense in Germany. In March 1921, right-wing nationalist groups led by Wolfgang Kapp attempted to overthrow the Weimar government and institute an autocratic
monarchist regime in its place. The coup collapsed within a matter of days after workers refused to cooperate
with the new government and declared a general strike.39 Although a complete failure, the “Kapp Putsch” was a
reminder of how fragile the political environment remained, and was another example of how the economic
pain of deleveragings/depressions can give rise to populist and reactionary leaders on both the Left and
the Right. As one frustrated Berlin businessman put it:
“Just at the moment when we begin again to work more than before…when in London the recognition is mounting
that through the imposition of the Versailles Treaty one has committed a fearful political stupidity, and that accordingly the exchange rate begins to improve, the military party…under the leadership of a man who is a notorious
reactionary, again throws everything overboard and forces our workers into a general strike and demonstrations that
are unnecessary because nothing will be achieved that way.”40

March 1920 to May 1921: Relative Stabilization
The fourteen months between March 1920 and May 1921 were a period of “relative stabilization.”41 The mark
halted its slide, prices remained stable, and the German economy outperformed the rest of the developed world.
Germany wasn’t collapsing from either economic or political chaos, as many had predicted, and those shorting
the mark lost considerable sums (a notable case is John Maynard Keynes, who personally lost about £13,000 on
the trade).42
The global backdrop at the time was one of severe contraction, driven by tightening monetary policy in the US
and UK. For example, between 1920 and 1921, industrial production fell by 20 percent in the US and 18.6 percent
in the UK, while unemployment climbed to 22 percent and 11.8 percent respectively.43

In contrast to other central banks, the Reichsbank kept monetary policy very
easy—the discount rate remained at 5 percent until 1922.44 The Reichsbank also
regularly intervened to inject additional liquidity when credit conditions
tightened. For instance, in the spring of 1921, when business liquidity tightened
moderately, the Reichsbank responded by accelerating its purchases of commercial bills (from 3.1 percent to 9 percent of bills outstanding).45 Fiscal policy also
remained accommodative, with real expenditures (ex-reparations) rising in 1920
and 1921.46 Although the budget deficit narrowed, it remained huge—roughly 10
percent of GDP—and continued to be financed by the issuance of floating debt.

The stimulative policies allowed Germany to escape the global contraction
and enjoy relatively strong economic conditions. Between 1919 and 1921,
industrial production increased by 75 percent! However, as you can see in the
charts below, levels of economic activity remained extremely depressed (e.g.,
industrial production and real GDP were still well below 1913 levels), and there

Rising economic activity and reflationary policies did not result in much
inflation in Germany between March 1920 and May 1921, as domestic inflationary pressures were being offset by global deflationary forces. Import
prices from the US and UK fell by about 50 percent, and rising capital flows
into the outperforming German economy helped to stabilize the currency,
which allowed for slower growth in the money supply. As you can see in the
charts below, this was a significant turnaround. The mark rallied, inflation
declined, and by early 1921 prices stopped rising for the first time since 1914.

There was also considerable optimism about the German economy abroad—in
fact, it became the new hot economy to invest in, as reflected by foreigners’
willingness to pour money into it, which financed an ever-growing trade deficit.
In fact, some commentators at the time began referring to Germany’s surging
capital inflows as a “tremendous” speculative bubble, with Keynes even calling
it “the greatest ever known.” Many of those flooding the market with mark
orders were new buyers, with no prior experience in the market they
were trading—one of the classic signs of a bubble. According to Keynes:
“[From those] in the streets of the capital…[to] barber’s assistants in the remotest
townships of Spain and South America…the argument has been the same…
Germany is a great and strong country; someday she will recover; when that
happens the mark will recover also, which will bring a very large profit.”47
For some perspective on the size of these inflows, by 1921 almost a third of all
deposits in the seven largest German banks were foreign-owned.48 These
speculative inflows supported a relative stabilization in the mark. It also
made the central bank’s job much easier by reducing the inherent

18 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

trade-offs between growth and inflation. As explained in my description of the archetypal template, when capital is flowing into a country,
it tends to lower the country’s inflation rate and stimulate its growth
rate (all other things being equal); when capital leaves, it tends to do the
opposite, making the central bank’s job much more difficult.
Strong capital inflows also meant that the German economy became increasingly dependent on “hot money” (i.e., speculative investments that could be
pulled out at a moment’s notice) continuing to come in, year after year, to
finance fiscal and external deficits.49 As is classic in the bubble phase of any
balance of payments crisis, increasing dependence on capital inflows to
maintain levels of spending and economic activity made the economic
recovery fragile, and sensitive to any minor event that could trigger a
shift in sentiment vis-à-vis the future prospects of the German economy.
The mark’s sharp appreciation in early 1920 was an unwelcome development for
policy makers because a falling mark was considered essential to maintaining
German export competitiveness, supporting employment growth, and building a
savings pool of hard currency earnings. It was considered the “one good fortune
in the midst of misfortune,” without which Germany would lose the possibility
of exports.50 The initial appreciation hit exports hard, with the chamber of
commerce going as far as to say that industry had practically “ground to a halt.”51
Unemployment surged, with the number of trade union members reported as
unemployed tripling. For these reasons, the economic ministry intervened
between March and June 1920—aiming to deliberately depress the mark and
stimulate employment. It worked. The mark fell, competitiveness returned, and
unemployment once again began to decline.52

During this period, German policy makers were more concerned about deflationary forces spreading to Germany than the inflation that their stimulative
policies could cause. Rising unemployment, and the potential social unrest it
could cause, were considered much more menacing than the return of rising
prices. As the reconstruction minister told a prominent industrialist:

The arguments between Germany and the Allies over reparations came to a head with “The London Ultimatum”
in May 1921, in which the Allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany did not accept
the new reparation bill. Total reparations were set at 132 billion gold marks (about 330 percent of German GDP).
Fifty billion was scheduled to be paid in quarterly installments, adding up to around 3 billion gold marks a year.
This was a debt-service burden of around 10 percent of German GDP, or 80 percent of export earnings.54
Payments for the remaining 70 billion would begin whenever the Allied powers, not Germany, determined its
economy capable of doing so. Not only did Germany have to service a huge hard currency debt burden, it also had
to live with the threat of its debt service payments tripling at a moment’s notice.
The reparations demanded were enormous and dashed expectations that a far more conciliatory agreement
would be reached. The structure of the payments was also deeply unnerving to potential investors and the
German public, as it meant that debt service burdens would likely get bigger if economic conditions improved.55
For context, the chart below shows the size of the hard currency debts imposed on Germany relative to other
economies prior to entering major inflationary depressions. As you can see, Weimar Germany dwarfs every other
case. The second chart shows Germany’s debt as a percent of GDP between 1914 and 1922.

As soon as the reparation burden was announced, the mark began selling off; it declined by 75 percent by the end
of the year. Inflation also returned, with prices almost doubling over the same period. For one prominent
German participant at Versailles, the ultimatum fulfilled his worst fears:
“The world must be made to understand that it is impossible to burden a country with debts and at the same time to
deprive it of the means of paying them…the most complete collapse of the currency…cannot…be avoided if the peace
treaty is maintained in its current form.”56

The reparation schedule created a balance of payments crisis. In many ways, a balance of payments
crisis is just like any other serious problem faced by individuals, households, and corporations in
making a payment. To come up with the money, a country must either 1) spend less, 2) earn more, 3)
finance the payments through borrowing and/or tapping into savings, or 4) default on the debt (or
convince creditors to give it relief). Unlike its domestic war loans, Germany could not print away the debt
burden, as the debts were not denominated in paper marks. Policy makers would need to rely on some combination of the four levers outlined above.
Cutting Spending Would Be Extremely Painful and Politically Dangerous
Since about 50 percent of the German government’s total revenues would have to be spent on reparations, cuts in
nonreparation expenses would need to be drastic to make a difference.57 Because most nonreparation spending
was going towards essential social services—unemployment relief, subsidies for food and housing, and funding
for leading public employers, such as the railways and shipyards—large spending cuts were considered “politically impossible.” With the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and its ongoing bloody civil war, as well as the
growing Communist movement in Germany, policy makers feared a potential revolution from the left.
Simultaneously, the increasingly humiliating demands of the Allied powers, and the economic pain that came
from meeting them, were fueling far-right nationalism. Fears of political chaos intensified as strikes, riots, and
acts of political violence became increasingly common. During the summer of 1920, a state of emergency had to
be declared following widespread looting;58 in March 1921, Communist groups seized control of several shipyards
and factories and were only dispersed following firefights with police;59 and in October 1921, finance minister
Matthias Erzberger was assassinated by ultranationalists for his role in the 1918 surrender.60 Given this context, it
should not be surprising that the government refused to cut back on social spending and the Reichsbank refused
to stop monetizing the deficit.
Tax Burdens Were Already Extremely High
While cutting spending was untenable, so was raising income by levying additional taxes. The problem was that
the Erzberger reforms of 1919 (discussed above) had already raised tax burdens considerably. Increasing this
burden posed the same political/social risks as cutting back on spending—i.e., any additional tax increases would
not only prove immensely difficult to pass (the Erzberger reforms themselves had been watered-down significantly by opposition in the Reichstag), but would also be likely to accelerate capital flight. Commenting on the
impossibility of meeting the reparation burden through taxation, Keynes wrote “the whips and scorpions of any
government recorded in history [would not have been] potent enough to extract nearly half…[the required]
income from a people so situated.”61
Existing Savings Were Extremely Limited and Securing Lending in Sufficient Size Was Impossible
There were virtually no savings to draw on to service those debts. The Treaty of Versailles had essentially seized
or frozen all of Germany’s prewar foreign holdings and canceled all debts owed to Germans. Moreover, those with
foreign currency savings (primarily exporters) were incentivized to keep their earnings in foreign bank accounts,
precisely because they had reason to fear the reparations burden would encourage a government seizure of their
wealth. As for the central bank’s gold reserves, they were not enough to cover even the first interest payment.

Further, there was little appetite internationally to extend Germany credit on a scale that would allow it to
spread out its reparation burden. This was for two reasons. First, most developed world economies were
burdened by war debts of their own (primarily owed to the United States) and were also in the midst of severe
recessions. Second, the German government (and most Germans) weren’t creditworthy. For instance, when the
head of the Reichsbank approached the Bank of England for a 500 million gold mark short-term loan to meet the
second reparation installment, he was “politely refused.”62 According to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer
at the time, “the difficulty was that there was a vicious circle. Germany said she could not stop the emission of
paper money and repay her obligations unless she was able to raise a foreign loan, and she could not raise a
foreign loan unless she could pay her obligations.”63
Of course, defaulting on the debt unilaterally was impossible, because Germany had been threatened with an
invasion. Though its leaders furiously and continuously tried to renegotiate the payments, bitter feelings from the
war (which had ended just a couple of years earlier) made the victors, especially France, disinclined to make
concessions.
Unlike a household facing a payment problem, a country can change the amount of existing currency,
and by doing so affect its value. This gives it an additional lever to manage a balance of payments crisis.
While the Reichsbank could try to defend the currency by raising rates and tightening credit, which would
increase the returns on holding mark denominated assets/deposits for creditors, and thereby attract more capital
from abroad while discouraging capital flight at home, it would also crush domestic demand, reduce imports, and
help close the trade deficit. That would require an unimaginably severe contraction in consumption, which
would have been intolerable for this already impoverished and conflict-ridden society to bear.
The only remaining alternative was to allow the currency to depreciate and print money to alleviate any potential
tightening in liquidity that resulted from the flight of marks abroad.
As we noted in the template, the most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflation is
that policy makers don’t close the imbalance between income and spending/debt service; instead, they
fund and keep funding spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money. Of course,
some targeted money printing is typical in any balance of payments crisis—and, if not overused, is helpful,
because it prevents the economic contraction from getting too severe. But when there is too much reflationary
printing of money/monetization, and too severe a currency devaluation (which is reflationary) relative to
the other levers for managing a deleveraging—especially the deflationary levers of austerity and debt
restricting/default—the most severe inflationary depressions can and do occur.
The reparation schedule—and the extreme difficulty of using austerity, dissaving, external borrowing,
and debt defaults as levers—pushed German policy makers to rely exclusively on money printing to
manage the crisis. While policy makers knew this would contribute to inflation, they wagered that it would be
the least terrible of their terrible choices. In my opinion, they made a mistake in not trying to achieve a better
balance between deflationary forces and inflationary ones.

22 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

June 1921–December 1921: 				
The Emerging Inflationary Spiral
The second half of 1921 saw the classic dynamics of an inflationary spiral
emerge. Germany’s impossible set of foreign debt obligations was
contributing to currency declines, which caused inflation and a liquidity
crisis. The central bank provided liquidity by printing money and buying
debt, rather than allowing commerce to deeply contract. This, in turn,
triggered further rounds of capital flight, inflation, tightening liquidity,
and money printing, so the spiral accelerated. In the midst of this, the
central bank depleted a substantial portion of its gold reserves to cover the
first reparation payments.
The spiral was still relatively contained compared to what was to come a year
later, mainly as foreigners continued to support the German balance of
payments by purchasing German assets. But reparation payments and local
capital flight caused the mark to decline 75 percent over the period and
inflation accelerated, approaching 100 percent per annum. The sharpest
declines came in October 1921, following the League of Nation’s decision to
cede Upper Silesia (an important coal mining and industrial region) to Poland,
despite a majority vote by its residents to remain in Germany.64
Rising inflation led to a surge in retail purchases. This pickup in
demand was not a sign of increasing economic activity but rather a
flight of income and savings into real goods before inflation could eat
away at the purchasing power of money. The American Council of
Hamburg spoke of a “vast amount of retail buying,” while the Hamburgische
Correspondent referred to a “monstrous lust for goods.”65 The situation soon
came to be described as one of “general liquidation,” because between
foreigners buying a lot since the mark was cheap and Germans buying goods
to escape inflation, the shelves in the shops were bare. A Berlin official
reported shock at the “plundering of the retailers by foreigners with highly
valued currencies,” while a British observer lamented that “many shops
declare themselves to be sold out; others close from 1 to 4 in the afternoon,
and most of them refuse to sell more than one article of the same kind to each
customer…Germans [are] laying in stores for fear of a further rise in prices or
a total depletion of stocks.”66
The same pressures led to a massive increase in consumer-durable and
real-asset purchases. Auto sales climbed to all-time highs, the textile trade had
bookings several months in advance, cotton firms refused to take new orders,
and most industries found themselves operating at full capacity and having to
introduce overtime to meet the growing demand for goods.67 Once again, this
burst of economic activity was not a sign of economic prosperity, but a classic
flight into inflation-hedge assets. According to one Bavarian official:

rid of the paper and have objects to exchange when the time comes that it is

“Responsibility for the murder attaches to the

As the central bank kept market interest rates anchored at 5 percent (by increasing purchases when liquidity tightened), and as inflation was generally 10x
higher, the real return on lending became very unattractive and the real
cost of borrowing (i.e., real interest rates) plummeted.69 This led to a surge
in borrowing, which became extremely attractive.70 As a result, real investment reached prewar highs71 and monthly bankruptcy rates declined by 75
percent.72 However, there was very little in this investment that was productive.
Firms would push borrowed money into capital less for its “use value” than for
its “intrinsic value.” Firms that did not do this, and kept most of their wealth in
debt assets (such as bonds), suffered devastating losses. This time was called the
“flight from the mark to the machine”; it resulted in many excessive investments
that performed poorly once the inflation had passed.73 Of course, all of this
accelerated inflation and reinforced the spiral.
Growing demand for real goods led to increasing employment in the
industries that produced those goods.74 So unemployment fell and
workers’ bargaining power increased as they pushed for wage increases
and better working hours. In the summer of 1921, numerous standoffs
between employers and laborers led to large nominal wage gains. However,
these gains were not enough to keep up with inflation and workers still saw
their real incomes fall by about 30 percent.75 This made tensions between the
“haves” and the “have-nots” even worse.

The only sector of the economy that saw some clear benefit from the
collapse of the mark was the export sector. Foreign sales increased as
German goods became cheaper on the international market. However,
the pickup in exports was less than it ordinarily would have been, given such
a large decline in the currency, for two reasons: First, there was considerable
hostility to German exports abroad, even as they became cheaper, which
limited the potential gains from a depreciating currency. Second, labor costs
were also declining in the rest of the developed world, as a result of deflation
from the severe global recession, limiting the potential competitiveness gains
from the depreciating mark.
The second half of 1921 also saw what one commentator called “an orgy of
speculation” in the stock market.76 Stocks nearly tripled in value over the
period (in inflation-adjusted terms) and in August the Berlin stock exchange
was so overloaded with orders that it was forced to shut down three times a
week. By November, operating days were reduced to just one day a week and

Once again, this bull market was not driven by improving economic

conditions. It reflected a rush to get out of money or to get short money
(i.e., borrow it) against a long “stuff” position. According to one observer:

to an extraordinary increase in the stock market business.”78

By the end of 1921, deteriorating economic conditions, the absence of faith in the

collapse. At the time, the inflation rate was nearing 100 percent. The only thing
preventing a total collapse was the foreigners’ willingness to continue to buy
marks and fund Germany’s massive external deficit (about 10 percent of GDP). As
the chart below illustrates, despite the loss of confidence in the mark at home,
many foreigners kept purchasing German assets at cheap prices.

Calls on Germany to Limit Paper Money: Allied
Board Plans Partial Moratorium

January 1922–May 1922: 			
Negotiating a Reparation Moratorium
Alarmed by the chaos in Germany, the Allied powers concluded that the
German economy needed some relief from reparation payments.79 This was
encouraging because at this stage it was the reparation debt burden that was
most crushing and most inescapable. Continuing with the status quo ran the
risk of a total economic collapse, which would worsen the political chaos at
the heart of Europe, while making it impossible to collect any reparation
payments in the future. However, there remained considerable disagreement
among the Allied powers as to the extent of such relief and what, if anything,
Germany should be required to give in return.
Central to the matter was a tension between the desire for vengeance and the
limitation of German power, and the recognition that economic realities
dictated that some compromises be made. This flavor of debtor/creditor
standoff is classic during deleveragings. Naturally, the debtors (i.e.,
Germans) demanded as much relief as they could get and the creditors
(i.e., the Allied powers) tried to get as much money back as they could
without plunging the debtor economy into insolvency. The game of
power brinksmanship was played by all. Commenting on the dynamics at
the time, J.P. Morgan, Jr. reportedly told a confidant:
“The Allies must make up their minds as to whether they wanted a weak
Germany who could not pay, or a strong Germany who could pay. If they wanted
a weak Germany they must keep her economically weak; but if they wanted her
to be able to pay they must allow Germany to exist in a condition of cheerfulness,
which would lead to successful business. This meant, however, that you would get
a strong Germany, and a Germany that was strong economically would, in a
sense, be strong from a military point of view also.”80
The question of restructuring Germany’s reparation payments was discussed at
a conference in Cannes, France, in January 1922. A temporary compromise was
reached under which the Reparations Commission reduced the debt service bill
by 75 percent for the remainder of the year, provided Germany agreed to raise
new taxes (including a forced loan of a billion gold marks on its wealthy
citizens), reduced spending and money printing, and granted the Reichsbank
formal independence from the government.81 These concessions were mostly
symbolic. The taxes agreed to were far too small to meaningfully close the
budget deficit and the president of the Reichsbank, Rudolf Havenstein, said he
welcomed more independence, as it would allow him to print as much money as
was needed to ensure liquidity without constraints from fiscal policy makers.82
Renewed optimism about meaningful relief from reparations halted the
mark’s slide. By the end of January, it had risen 30 percent from its 1921 lows,
and inflation, while remaining high (about 140 percent per annum), had
stopped accelerating. The inflationary spiral was halted for now, providing
much-needed relief to the German economy. As negotiations progressed,
German policy makers pressed the Allies for additional concessions, arguing
forcefully that it was the balance of payments, and not the central bank’s
money printing, that was ultimately responsible for the inflationary crisis. In a
speech to the Reichstag on March 29, Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau told
German lawmakers:

26 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

“Over and over again we encounter the notion that if the value of our money has
been ruined this can only be because we have printed money. The recipe which we
are given against this is: stop your printing press, bring your budget in order, and
the misfortune is ended. A grave economic error!…[How is it possible] to make
continuous gold payments without the help of foreign loans and at the same time
keep the exchange rate intact? The attempt has never been made to give such a
prescription and it cannot be given. For a country that does not produce gold
cannot pay in gold unless it buys this gold with export surpluses [which Germany
did not have] or unless it is borrowed [which Germany could not do].” 83
As you can see, the mechanics of economics and markets were simple and
basically the same then as they are now. While the central bank could easily
extinguish its domestic currency denominated debt (in the ways previously
described) it could not easily extinguish its external debts (for previously
explained reasons).
From February until May, expectations surrounding the currency continued
to be driven primarily by news of the reparation negotiations.84 When news
suggested there would be a comprehensive agreement, the mark rallied, and
inflation expectations fell.85 When new information suggested that an
agreement was less likely, the mark fell and inflation expectations rose.86 The
mark experienced numerous 10 to 20 percent swings on such changes of
sentiment, and by the end of May was down about 40 percent versus the
dollar, as the prospects of a reparation agreement deteriorated.
The chart below gives a taste of how new pieces of information on the
reparation negotiations led to major swings in the mark. As you can see from
the below table, the markets chopped up and down in big moves every time
there was essentially any update on reparation negotiations. Imagine having
to trade through such volatility!

June 1922–December 1922:
Hyperinflation Begins
In June 1922, expectations of a reparation settlement collapsed, as did the
mark. This was due to three interconnected events: First the French, who had
always been the most reluctant among the Allied powers to reduce reparation
burdens, declared they would no longer accept the conclusions of the reparations commission regarding Germany’s capacity to pay.87 Rather, France would
make its own determinations on what German reparations should be, and
would seize German assets, particularly some of its most productive assets
(i.e., the coal mines in the Ruhr), if Germany defaulted.88 Instead of a possible
moratorium, Germany would now have to pay France whatever the French
thought was appropriate, or risk a sustained occupation of some of its most
valuable territory.
The French declaration also undermined an additional plan to support the
German economy. An international committee had been established, headed
by the American financier JP Morgan, Jr., to investigate the possibility of
extending Germany a gold loan to rebuild its economy and ease the burden of
external debt. However, this loan was contingent on progress on a reparation
moratorium, for without it such a loan could almost certainly not be paid back.
Following the French declaration, the loan committee was forced to conclude
that extending credit to Germany was impossible.89
Finally, on June 24, Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau was assassinated by a
right wing group. Rathenau, despite some of his belligerent speeches, was one
of the few German politicians who was trusted by the Allied powers and
enjoyed significant support at home.90 If there was anyone who could mediate
a settlement with the Reparations Commission and get it through the
Reichstag, it was Rathenau. Of course, this also illustrates the threat of
nationalism and extremist populism that was hanging over Germany.
Unlike earlier, foreigners now rushed to pull their capital from
Germany. As noted previously, about a third of all deposits in German banks
were foreign-owned, and foreign speculation had been a huge source of
support for the German economy and balance of payments. Over the next few
months, about two thirds of these deposits disappeared and capital inflows
collapsed.91 Simultaneously, capital flight of Germans wanting to get out
accelerated; well-to-do citizens rushed to get their wealth out before the
confiscatory taxes agreed to in the January compromise came into effect. The
mark collapsed and hyperinflation began.
The result was an acute liquidity crisis in the German banking system
that led to runs on the banks. The rate of central bank printing was no longer
fast enough to keep up with the flight of marks abroad and rising prices. By
July, banks were forced to go on three-day work weeks, and had to inform
their depositors that they did not have enough cash on hand to either honor
their deposits or make weekly wage payments for their large business clients.92
Some even began printing their own marks, which was illegal. The liquidity
crisis was self-reinforcing. Depositors, seeing that the banks were
struggling to honor their liabilities, began withdrawing their deposits in
ever-growing numbers, which only made the liquidity crisis worse.

28 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

By August 1922, the economy was on the brink of financial collapse. The
central bank was forced to respond by rapidly accelerating the pace at which it
was printing marks and monetizing a growing share of government debt.

The central bank also began purchasing commercial bills en masse. As the
liquidity crisis deepened in the fall, it additionally accelerated its provision of
direct credits to the banking system. By the end of the year, the Reichsbank
would end up holding about one third of all commercial bills in circulation
and would have increased its credits to the banking system by 1,900 percent.93
Such interventions helped prevent the financial system from collapsing, and
led to a ten-fold increase in the money supply.

Unlike past bouts of currency depreciation and money printing, in which
inflation would pick up substantially but never enter hyperinflation territory,
this round of currency depreciation and money printing sent inflation
skyrocketing. Part of this was due to the scale of the liquidity injection that
was needed to offset the pullback in foreign capital, but part of it was also due
to changing inflationary psychology. While most people had believed that
inflation was being semi-managed, now most believed it was out of control.

In inflationary depressions, it is classic that with each round of printing, more money leaves the
currency instead of going into economic activity. As domestic currency holders see that investors that short
cash (i.e., borrow in the weakening currency) and buy real/foreign assets are repeatedly better off than those
who save and invest at home, they increasingly catch on and shift from investing printed money in productive
assets to purchasing real assets (like gold) and foreign currency. Foreign investors no longer return because they
have been repeatedly burned.
As early as August, with prices rising by over 50 percent a month and accelerating, policy makers recognized that
they were approaching a hyperinflationary spiral, but they felt they had no alternative but to continue printing.94
Why didn’t they stop?
Once an inflationary depression reaches the hyperinflationary stage, it is extremely difficult to stop
printing. This is because when extreme capital flight and extreme inflation feed off one another, money
becomes harder to come by, even as it loses its worth. When Keynes visited Hamburg in the summer of 1922,
still in the early phase of the hyperinflation, he vividly described the phenomenon:
“The prices in the shops change every hour. No one knows what this week’s wages will buy at the end of the week. The
mark is at the same time valueless and scarce. On the one hand, the shops do not want to receive marks, and some of
them are unwilling to sell at any price at all. On the other hand…the banks were so short of ready cash that the
Reichsbank advised them to cash no checks for more than 10,000 marks…and some of the biggest institutions were
unable to cash their customers’ checks for payment of weekly wages.”95
To stop printing would result in an extreme shortage of cash and bring about a total collapse of the
financial system and all commerce. As one economist noted at the time:
“[To stop the printing press] would mean that in a very short time the entire public, and above all the Reich, could no
longer pay merchants, employees, or workers. In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railways
and post office, national and local government, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped.”96
People tend to think that hyperinflations are caused by central banks recklessly printing too much
money, and all they need to do to stop it is to turn off the printing press. If it were that easy, hyperinflations would almost never occur! Instead, inflation spirals push policy makers into circumstances where printing
is the least bad of several terrible options.

30 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

In the case of Weimar Germany, the cost of not printing was not only potential
economic collapse, but political fragmentation. France’s repeated threats to
occupy German territory if reparations were not paid made halting the printing
press an invitation to a foreign invasion. It also lowered hopes for productive
reparations negotiations. As one prominent industrialist put it at the time:
“The Reichsbank can no more stop inflation than the Burgermeister of Hamburg
can tell the patients in the hospital to stop being ill…as long as it is possible for the
French to invade Germany, there can be no talk of a stabilization of our currency.”97
By September, Germany was trapped in a classic hyperinflationary
spiral. Extreme capital withdrawals and rapidly rising prices were
forcing the central bank to choose between extreme illiquidity and
printing money at an accelerating rate. As doing the former would
result in a total collapse in business activity, there was really no choice.
However, as the money supply grew, no one wanted to hold it in such a
depreciating environment. The velocity of money accelerated, triggering even more capital flight, money printing, and inflation, and so on
and so forth.
You can see this relationship most vividly in the chart below—which must be
shown in logarithmic terms due to the exponential growth rates in inflation
and the money supply. As you can see, currency weakness was leading inflation, which was leading money supply growth—not the other way around.
Reckless money printing was less the cause of the hyperinflation than
what was required to prevent massive deflationary defaults by banks
(and just about everyone else) and a deflationary economic collapse.

Remember that money and credit serve two purposes: As a medium of
exchange and a store hold of wealth. As the spiral accelerated, the mark
completely lost its status as a store hold of value. People rushed to
exchange it for any available alternative—real goods, foreign exchange, and
capital equipment. Very soon, exponential rates of inflation made it
impractical to trade in marks, so the currency also began to lose its

status as a means of exchange. Foreign currencies (especially the dollar) and even makeshift currencies
became increasingly common in day-to-day transactions and price quotations. For instance, local branches of the
Reichsbank found that they did not have enough actual paper notes for businesses to meet their payroll obligations.98 So, the central bank and the finance ministry allowed some large depositors to print their own currencies.
These were called Notgeld—which literally means “emergency money.”99 Soon, everyone began considering
whether the mark would go extinct. According to the Frankfurter Zeitung, by October 1922:
“German economic life is…dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark: is it to remain the German
currency, or is it doomed to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of
account in domestic transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars, especially, has
established itself, not only in firms’ internal accounting practice, but above all as the method of price quotation in
trade, industry and agriculture.”100
In a desperate attempt to calm the inflationary spiral, on October 12 1922, the government stepped in to stop the
ever-growing flight into foreign currency. Restrictions were put on German citizens purchasing foreign FX.101
Such capital controls are a classic lever to control inflationary depressions; they are rarely successful.
The reasons for this are that a) capital controls have limited effectiveness at best because they are
usually pretty easy to get around and b) trying to trap people typically leads them to want to escape
even more. Not being able to get one’s money out of the country triggers a psychology that is analogous to the
inability to get one’s money out of a bank: it produces fear that produces a run.
The stock market was one of the few remaining domestic escapes from the inflation. After declining 50
percent (in real terms) since June, stocks actually rallied in the second half of October—but like the fall of 1921,
this rally had nothing to do with underlying economic conditions or the future prospects of the economy. In fact,
in the fall of 1922, real profit margins were collapsing as the chaos of the hyperinflation hit productivity.102 The
rally was also extremely small in the context of the overall real stock market decline during the debt crisis.

January 1923–August 1923: The Occupation
of the Ruhr and the Final Days of Inflation
In January 1923, with the economy already in chaos and prompted by
Germany missing a promised delivery of timber as a reparation payment, a
French-Belgian force invaded Germany and occupied the Ruhr (Germany’s
primary industrial region). The French hoped that this action would pressure
Germany to pay reparations more cooperatively and in the meantime allow
France to extract payments in coal. The Germans responded by declaring
“passive resistance.”103 Miners in the Ruhr would strike in an attempt to make
the occupation as costly as possible for the French government. However, this
resistance would need to be subsidized by the Reich, as both the miners and
their employers would have to be paid. It also meant that about half of the
country’s coal supply would need to be imported, adding additional strain on
the balance of payments.104 As a result, government spending increased, the
balance of payments deteriorated, liquidity shortages pushed the Reichsbank
to print even more, and inflation, which was already at astronomical levels,
accelerated even more.
France’s aggression left an opening for Germany in the reparation negotiations, as the occupation of a country approaching economic ruin was widely
denounced. To buy time, the Reichsbank began issuing dollar denominated
debt (at a considerable discount to international prices due to its credit risk) in
order to buy marks—with the central bank targeting a peg against the dollar.
Between January and June of 1923, the Reichsbank sold about 400 million
gold marks of borrowed foreign exchange and central bank reserves to defend
the mark’s peg against the dollar. The central bank also raised rates to 18
percent (but given that inflation was running at close to 10,000 percent this
was mostly a symbolic move).105 According to the president of the Reichsbank:
“The intervention did not…have as its purpose the permanent and final stabilization of the mark. Such an undertaking will only become possible when the
reparations problem is seriously brought to a solution. What it had as its purpose
was…to recover for the German economy…as long as possible…a time of
somewhat calm…to free the market from wild and unscrupulous speculation and
to protect the German people from a further rapid price increase which would
have exhausted it.”106

The FX intervention halted the mark’s slide (it actually appreciated by 50
percent for the first three months of the intervention) and introduced a brief
period of deflation that certainly hurt the shorts.107 However, by May it
became clear that the Reichsbank did not have the reserves to pay out
dollar denominated principal and interest payments and maintain the
peg, so the fixed exchange rate policy was abandoned six months after it
was put in place and hyperinflation returned stronger than before (reaching
36,000,000,000 percent by November 1923).108

Now the German economy found itself burdened by an additional stock of hard

as long as was necessary to get what they were owed. Throughout the summer,
some sporadic interventions in the FX market were attempted, but none were
able to curb inflation or prevent the downward spiral in the exchange rate.109

From July 1922 until November 1923 the mark depreciated by 99.99999997
percent versus the dollar (i.e., the cost of dollars increased 1,570 billion
percent) and prices rose by 387 billion percent! For some perspective on what
these numbers mean, in 1913 a total of six billion marks circulated as currency
and coin in the whole German economy. By late October 1923, the entire stock
of money in 1913 would just about get you a one kilo-loaf of rye bread.111 Living
through such chaos was immensely painful and traumatizing for German
citizens—and experiences of the inflation would later serve to validate many
of the criticisms made by Nazi politicians of the “disastrous” Weimar era.

34 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

Late 1923 to 1924: Ending the Hyperinflation
By late 1923, the hyperinflation had created intolerably painful conditions
within Germany. Unemployment was rising rapidly, inflation was well above
1,000,000 percent, real tax revenues were diminishing at an alarming rate,112
food was growing scarce, and transacting with marks had become almost
impossible.113 Without an effective means of exchange, the economic machine
of the nation had ground to a halt. The resulting suffering stunned people of
all walks of life. As one local mayor put it, “I have never encountered such
hordes of people starving and wandering about.”114 And all recognized that the
crisis would soon boil over into mass riots or revolution.115 Rudolf Wissell, who
would later serve as Germany’s minister of labor, captured the prevailing
sentiment of the period: “The inflation in which we find ourselves at this time
is murdering the Republic. It will be the gravedigger of our Republic.”116
The Allied powers concluded that without substantial reparation relief,
German policy makers would remain helpless to avert a total collapse of the
economy. So, in November 1923 they suspended reparations payments and
reopened negotiations with the Germans on restructuring the debt.117 This
gave German policy makers the breathing room they needed.
German policy makers took five crucial steps to curb inflation, each following
logically from the last:

Reform

reparation burden was not substantially reduced. After all, why would any
investor or saver want to hold German currency if they knew the government
had huge external liabilities it could not pay?
Below, we walk through each of these measures in detail, moving roughly
chronologically.

1) Restructuring the Reparations Debt
Although the process of negotiating with the Allies was slow, drawn out, and
painful, some critical concessions were secured very early that provided the
breathing room that was necessary to implement the policy changes that ended
the hyperinflation.118 Without reparation relief, the structural drivers of the
inflation would have remained intact, and it would have been highly unlikely
that any new currency could have commanded faith as a store hold of wealth.
Significant progress came as early as September 1923, when German industrialists in the Ruhr began to cooperate with the Weimar government in its negotiations with the French.119 These industrial magnates had long resisted any
concessions to France when it came to reparations payments, but as conditions
continued to deteriorate and workers began to riot, they recognized the need for
diplomacy, and eventually agreed to resume coal transfers.120 By mid-October,
the Weimar government was able to completely end its financial support of
“passive resistance” to the Ruhr occupation, both opening the way for progress
in talks with the French and eliminating one of its largest expenses.121
The Weimar government quickly built on the progress it had made in the
Ruhr. By the end of November, British and French negotiators had created a
new committee—the Dawes committee—to review and potentially reduce
Germany’s reparations obligations.122 Critically, the committee agreed to
suspend reparations payments until it came to its final conclusions—making it
far easier for Germany to balance its budget during the stabilization period.123
For the next 10 months, Germany did not have to make a single hard currency
payment to the reparations commission. Moreover, when the Dawes Plan
came into full force in August 1924, it significantly and permanently eased
Germany’s reparations burden.124 Payments were rescheduled, and debt
service costs reduced, to the point that reparations payments amounted to
only one percent of German GNP in 1924 and 1925—a reduction of over 90
percent versus 1923.125
Although Germany would still have to pay the full 130 billion gold marks of
reparations, payments were now so spread out that it was possible to meet
them. The chart below gives some perspective on how significant this shift
was by comparing what Germany could have been asked to pay at any moment
between 1921 and 1923 (if the Allies had demanded Germany begin paying
down the full reparation bill), what they actually had to pay between 1921 and
1923 (i.e., the London Schedule, under which some payments were suspended
until the Allies thought Germany was capable of paying them), what debt
service payments look like leading into the typical inflationary deleveraging,
and what Germany had to pay after reparation payments were restricted in
1924 (i.e., the Dawes Plan). As you can see, the Dawes Plan dramatically
reduced the FX debt service burden.

2) Creating a New Currency
Creating a new currency with very hard backing is the most classic path
that countries suffering from inflationary deleveragings follow in order to end
them. In the Weimar case, this currency replacement process came in roughly
three stages, beginning in August 1923 and ending in October 1924.126
The first steps toward replacing the mark were disorganized and reactive,
driven by necessity rather than by any definite plan. By the summer of 1923,
transacting in the mark had become so difficult that major institutions within
Germany turned to alternatives, even though these had their own flaws.127 Many
resorted to using foreign exchange in place of domestic currency. From late 1922
onward, most major industries in Germany began to set prices in foreign
currencies, and by 1923 much of the wholesale trade within Germany was
conducted directly in dollars, francs, or florins.128 Those who could not access

foreign currency turned to “emergency money” as a last resort. These emergency bills were issued by local governments, trade associations, or companies, and were usually at least theoretically backed by real assets.129 This
emergency money, though often illegal, was easier to use than the paper mark, and by the fall of 1923, nearly 2,000
types of it were actively circulating in Germany.130
Recognizing the need for a currency with a stable value, the government attempted to give a stamp of authority
to this informal system. Specifically, in August 1923 it began issuing very small-denomination debt, indexed to
dollars, which it hoped would be used as a temporary currency until a better solution could be found.131 These
“Gold Loan” bills could either be circulated directly or used as a more secure backing for other emergency
currencies.132 And, though they were ultimately backed by nothing more than a stamp claiming they were
“wertbestandig” (stable value) and a promise that the government could “raise supplements to the tax on capital”
in order to honor them, they did retain their value.133 In fact, the public was so desperate for a reliable store of
wealth that the gold loan bills tended to be hoarded rather than used, and they disappeared almost entirely from
circulation shortly after being issued.134
The second phase of the transition to a new currency began on October 15, 1923, when the government announced
the creation of a new national bank—the Rentenbank—and a new stable-value currency, the rentenmark, which
would enter circulation on November 15.135 Unlike previous efforts to create a currency with “stable value,” the
more ambitious rentenmark scheme was an immediate, “miraculous” success.136 Crucially, since rentenmarks could
be exchanged for either a fixed quantity of paper marks or a fixed quantity of hard assets (and vice versa), the hard
backing behind the rentenmark applied not only to newly issued bills (as had been the case with the gold loan
bills), but to all of the paper marks already in circulation. Specifically, the rentenmark was pegged to the paper
mark at a ratio of one to one trillion, and to the dollar at a ratio of 4.2 to one—a symbolically significant exchange
rate, as it set the gold value of the rentenmark equal to that of the pre-war, peace-time mark.137
In the months that followed, both of these pegged rates held, and by December both the rentenmark and the
newly-pegged paper mark were trading at par in foreign markets, while inflation had fallen to sustainable levels.138

3) Imposing Limits on Money Printing

The News

The key to the new currency’s lasting success was that the Rentenbank issued
relatively little of it and convincingly backed its issues with real assets. At the
same time, there weren’t large debts denominated in it—the total amount of
credit the Rentenbank could extend was capped at 2.4 billion marks.139 And,
unlike the old gold loan bills, rentenmarks were directly secured by
mortgages on 5 percent of all German agricultural and industrial property
(“renten” refers to the annuities paid on these mortgages).140 Even more
important than this direct backing was the implicit security provided by the
Reichsbank’s gold reserves. By 1923 the real value of the money supply had
been so reduced by the popular flight from paper marks that it could be
backed entirely by the government’s reserves.141 This reduction in the value of
circulating currency was reinforced as the Reichsbank began cracking down
on illegal emergency money following the introduction of the rentenmark and
withdrew its gold loan bills from circulation.142
As shown on the chart below, the monetary base in dollars had fallen to equal
Germany’s gold reserves by 1923.

After a year of relative stability, German policy makers implemented the third
phase of the currency transition. On October 11, 1924, they introduced another
new hard currency (the reichsmark), which could be purchased with rentenmarks at a one to one ratio. Unlike the rentenmark, which had only been
formally backed by mortgage bonds, the new reichsmark could be exchanged
directly for bullion at the Reichsbank. Specifically, it could be converted into
precisely the same quantity of gold as the pre-war mark.143 All remaining
paper marks were withdrawn from circulation by June 5, 1925, while the old
currency (the rentenmark) was gradually phased out over the next decade.144

But as we will see, it took much more than a new currency to create a lasting
stabilization. The rentenmark and reichsmark were crucial pieces of the
reform process, but they weren’t the only pieces. Currency depends on the
credibility of the institutions issuing it. The fact that there were not a lot of
promises to deliver currency (i.e., not a lot of debt denominated in the new
currencies) meant that the central bank was not in the position of having to
choose between inflationary monetization of debt and deflationary defaults on
it. And the fact that the amount of the currency was limited to the amount of
backing behind it meant it could be kept stable. The Rentenbank faced a
difficult challenge as it attempted to gain credibility in the fall of 1923, but it
succeeded because its fundamentals were solid.

Even the partly unemployed decreased from
635,839 to 257,840.”

4) Ending Monetization
In order to build confidence in a new currency, countries in inflationary deleveragings need to stop monetizing debt. As long as the government can force the central bank to print to cover its liabilities, there is a risk
that the new currency will be debased and its supposedly hard backing
abandoned. That is one of the reasons it is important that central banks be
independent of the political system.
Reassurance that monetization would stop came in the form of two major
announcements—one initially private and one quite public. First, on August 18,
1923, the Reichsbank informed the Weimar government that, beginning in
1924, it would not discount any additional government debt.145 Though this
memo was private, it quickly circulated among the industrial elite, and it
spurred policy makers to seriously reconsider the need for fiscal reforms.146
The second piece of reassuring news came on October 15, 1923, when central
bank officials publicly stated that the new Rentenbank would cap total
government credits (in this case at 1.2 billion rentenmarks). Additionally, its
new policy would forbid the Reichsbank from monetizing any government
debt after November 15.147
For a time, both the public and the government itself doubted that the central
bank and the Rentenbank would honor these promises. After all, the
Rentenbank lent the government the entirety of its 1.2 billion rentenmark
allocation almost immediately.148 And, by December 1923, the government had
already requested an additional 400 million rentenmarks.149 When officials at
the Rentenbank stood firm, however, they successfully signaled the beginning
of a new era of central bank independence—and the end of a long period of
unchecked monetization.

5) Closing the Deficit
When the central bank stops monetizing debts during an inflationary
deleveraging, the government can either find new creditors to finance
its deficits, close those deficits, or take control over the central bank
and continue monetizing debt. Since finding new creditors is usually
impossible in an inflationary deleveraging, and monetizing debt only
postpones the problem, the budget ultimately needs to be balanced.
By late 1923, the Weimar regime had come to the conclusion that it needed to
close the deficits. There was no choice, and with the debts largely relieved,
this was now possible. In the words of the German minister of finance, “If we
do not succeed in cutting loose from the inflationary economy through
ruthless choking off of Reich expenditures, then the only prospect we have is
general chaos.”150
The government had run budget deficits since the outbreak of the war in
1914.151 However, in August 1923, the government took steps to address the
problem by indexing certain taxes to inflation and passing additional
emergency taxes.152 By October, it had indexed all taxes to inflation.153
Additionally, the government took aggressive measures to reduce expenses,
dismissing 25 percent of its employees and cutting the salaries of the remainder by 30 percent.154 The Weimar regime ended its expensive subsidies to
workers engaged in “passive resistance” in the Ruhr.155 Such austerity was

40 Part 2: German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918–1924)

extremely painful, and would have been almost impossible to stomach a year
or two before. But the hyperinflation had caused so much suffering and chaos
by the end of 1923 that the German public was willing to do almost anything
to bring prices back under control.
Most important, though, was the effect of more gradual inflation and a more
stable exchange rate on the yield of existing taxes.156 Temporary stabilization
created a virtuous cycle of sorts: by reducing the rate of inflation, the stabilization increased real tax receipts, helping reduce budget strains and increasing the public’s confidence in the government’s ability to avoid future
monetization. Following the introduction of the rentenmark in November, real
tax receipts increased rapidly, rising from about 15 million gold marks in
October 1923 to more than 300 million in December 1923.157
By January 1924, the government was running a surplus.158

6) Tightening Credit
Officials decided to significantly tighten access to credit, so private credit
wouldn’t add to inflationary pressures. This tightening was implemented
through two channels. First, the government announced in February 1924
that it would “revalue” some privately held debts (i.e., require debtors to give
creditors more than face value).159 These included mortgages, bank deposits,
and industrial debentures whose values had fallen to almost nothing during
the hyperinflation.160 Although the policy was implemented to appease angry
creditors, it also worked as a tightening.161 Just as debt reductions have the
effect of easing credit, weakening the currency, and increasing inflation, debt
revaluations tighten credit, support currencies, and lower inflation.
Second—and more significantly—on April 7 1924, the Reichsbank decided to
cap the total amount of credit it would extend to the private sector. It wouldn’t
call back any existing debt, but it would extend new credit only as prior debts
were paid off.162 This strict cap on new credit creation was painful for
businesses in the short term, but it also meaningfully stabilized German
inflation, which turned slightly negative in May 1924.163

7) Accumulating Foreign Exchange Reserves

Important Election Since the War Fails to Arouse
Great Interest
“Thirty-five million men and women in
Germany who have attained the age of 20 will
have an opportunity tomorrow to give
untrammeled expression to their political
preferences, and upon their verdict will depend
in a large measure the future of German politics
and economics, as well as of the nation’s
foreign relations.”

Though all the programs, policies, and agreements described above put the
German economy on progressively firmer footing, not everyone was convinced
they would ensure a permanent stabilization. In fact, as Germany implemented its stabilization regime between November 1923 and October 1924,
speculators continually bet against the mark.164 As long as Germany lacked a
meaningful foreign exchange reserve, these speculative attacks remained a
threat to its continued stability.

Two major shifts helped restore Germany’s depleted foreign exchange
reserves. The first was the transfer of privately held foreign currencies to the
Reichsbank. As institutions and individuals within Germany gained increasing confidence in the new rentenmark as a means of exchange, they began to
convert the foreign currency they had hoarded during the hyperinflation into
new bills.165 Between November 1923 and January 1924 alone, foreign
exchange holdings at the Reichsbank grew from about 20 million gold marks
to nearly 300 million.166 Though these foreign exchange flows paused as
inflation rose in early 1924 (and individuals began accumulating foreign
currencies again), they resumed once credit standards within Germany were
tightened and inflation stabilized (as described above).167

from which the present government was
formed—the German People’s Party, the
Centrum, and the Democratic Party—will form
the next government, probably in conjunction
with the Socialists.”

Entente, for qualified acceptance of the Dawes
report as against summary rejection thereof, for
continuance of the German Republic as against
restoration of the German monarchy.”

The second major shift came through the Dawes Plan. In addition to reducing
reparations burdens, the Dawes Committee also extended Germany a significant foreign exchange loan.168 The loan, issued in October 1924, amounted to
800 million gold marks worth of foreign currency, divided mainly between
dollars, pounds, and francs.169 Though the amount was not extraordinarily
large, it meaningfully improved the Reichsbank’s credibility when it came to
defending against speculative attacks.170 It also sent a reassuring signal to
foreign investors. In the four years following the implementation of the Dawes
Plan, American investors poured money into German debt, attracted by its
relatively high yields.171
By 1924, the crisis was largely over. Germany would enter a brief period of
recovery before the Great Depression hit it hard a decade later. This second
crisis was not only economically devastating but fueled the rise of right wing
and left wing populists, Hitler’s rise to power, and all that followed. But that’s
another story.

was not really adequately secured. Since the gold-denominated
mortgage bonds that backed the rentenmark paid 5 percent,
while market interest rates for stable-value loans were much
higher, these mortgages traded below par. The “real” exchange

value of the rentenmark, therefore, was well below its par value.

US Debt Crisis and Adjustment
(1928–1937)

News &
Federal Reserve Bulletin

This section gives a detailed account of the big US debt cycle of the 1920s and
1930s, including the Great Depression, which is probably the most iconic case
of a deflationary deleveraging. It takes you through the particulars of the case
with reference to the template laid out earlier in the “Archetypal Big Debt
Cycle.” Though the Great Depression happened nearly a century ago, its
dynamic was basically the same as what occurred in and around 2008. As with
the other cases in this part, I both describe the timeline (which in this case is
based on the library of books I’ve amassed on the Great Depression over the
years rather than my personal experience trading through it) and provide a
real-time “newsfeed” drawn from newspaper headlines and what the Federal
Reserve was saying at the time that runs along the sides of the pages.

1927–1929: The Bubble
Following the world war and the recession of 1920 to 1921, the US economy
experienced a period of rapid technology-led growth. The continuing electrification of rural and small-town America and the growth of the middle class
opened up huge markets for new technologies. The radio was the new, hot
technology and the number of radio sets owned grew from 60,000 in 1922 to
7.5 million in 1928.1 The automobile industry also grew rapidly and by 1929
there were 23 million cars on the road—on average, about one per every five
Americans (which was nearly three times higher than in 1920).2 Technological
advances also led to a productivity boom (factory worker output per hour
increased 75 percent from 1922 to 1928). Technology breakthroughs filled the
newspapers, driving wide-spread optimism about the economy.

In the midst of that technology boom, the early part of the cycle (roughly from
1922 to 1927) saw strong economic growth and subdued inflation. The broader
period became known as the “fat years,” as both capitalists and workers
experienced significant gains.3 Corporate profits rose to postwar highs,
unemployment dropped to postwar lows, and real wages rose more than 20
percent. In the pre-bubble years of 1923 to 1926, debt growth was appropriately in line with income growth because it was being used to finance
activities that produced fast income growth. At the same time, the stock
market roared higher while experiencing little volatility—investors in US

stocks made over 150 percent between the start of 1922 and the end of 1927.
The hottest tech stocks at the time—Radio Corporation of America (known to
traders as “Radio”) and General Motors—led the gains.4
Then a bubble began to emerge. As is classic, the bubble had its roots in
the dizzying productivity and technological gains of the period and
people making leveraged bets that they would continue. One writer
explained the growing belief that the economy had entered a “New Era”: “The
New Era…meant permanent prosperity, an end to the old cycle of boom and
bust, steady growth in the wealth and savings of the American people, [and]
continuously rising stock prices.”5
The US was an extremely attractive destination for investment from abroad.
The US and most of the rest of the world were on a gold standard at the time,
which meant governments promised to exchange their money for gold at a
fixed exchange rate in order to provide assurance to lenders that they wouldn’t
just print a lot of money and devalue lenders’ claims. Gold flowed from other
countries to the US, because that was effectively how investors bought dollars.
This played an important role in determining how events transpired during the
lead-up to the crash in 1929, but we won’t get into that now.
When other countries (France, Germany, and the UK) became worried that
they were losing gold too quickly, they asked the US Federal Reserve to lower
dollar interest rates to make dollars less attractive. More focused on growth
and inflation than on the debt growth that was being used to buy financial
assets, in the spring of 1927, the Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate
from 4 percent to 3.5 percent. This, of course, had the knock-on effect of
encouraging US credit creation. This is a typical way that central banks
inadvertently finance bubbles.
The economy accelerated in response to the easing, and news of the strong
economy filled headlines and radio broadcasts nationwide. Over the second
half of 1928, industrial production rose 9.9 percent and automobile production
hit an all-time high. The boom made people euphoric. At the start of 1929, The
Wall Street Journal described the pervasive strength of the US economy: “One
cannot recall when a new year was ushered in with business conditions
sounder than they are today…Everything points to full production of industry
and record-breaking traffic for railroads.”6
The easing by the Federal Reserve also produced a bull market in stocks
that showed every sign of a classic bubble. I’ll repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:
1.

Prices are high relative to traditional measures

2.

Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these
high levels

3. There is broad bullish sentiment
4. Purchases are being financed by high leverage
5. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases
(e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to
speculate or protect themselves against future price gains

50 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

6. New buyers (i.e., those who weren’t previously in the market)
have entered the market
7.

Stimulative monetary policy helps inflate the bubble, and tight
policy contributes to its popping

After prices nearly doubled over 1927 and 1928, stocks sold at extremely
high multiples financed by borrowing (i.e., margin). Many stocks were
valued as much as 30 times earnings.7 The popular book New Levels in the
Stock Market, published in 1929 by Ohio State professor Charles Amos Dice,
captured the pervasive sentiments of the bull market. He argued that the
broader base of investors in the market made higher valuations more or less
permanent, proclaiming, “Among the yardsticks for predicting the behavior of
stocks which have been rendered obsolete…[is] the truism that what goes up
must come down.”8
New buyers flooded the market, and many of them were unsophisticated
investors with no prior experience with stocks, one of the classic signs of
a bubble. Brokerage firms rapidly expanded to cater to aspiring speculators
across the country; the number of branch offices outside of Wall Street
increased by more than 50 percent between 1928 and 1929.9 “Wherever one
went,” a broker declared in 1929, “one met people who told of their stock-market winnings. At dinner tables, at bridge, on golf links, on trolley cars, in
country post offices, in barber shops, in factories and shops of all kinds.”10
During this period, stock purchases were financed by high and rapidly
increasing leverage, and more and more of this leverage occurred
outside the regulated and protected banking system. Classically, new
and fast-growing lending markets where a lot of levering up occurs are
symptomatic of bubbles. Often, banks are able to make these new assets
seem safe to investors via guarantees, or through the way the assets are
combined and packaged—and without a crisis to stress-test them, it can
be hard to tell how safe they actually are. These “innovations” typically
lead to the next crisis if not monitored, understood, and managed by
regulators. The bankers and the speculators made a lot of fast money in
a symbiotic relationship (i.e., the bankers would lend to the speculators
at fat spreads and the speculators would buy stocks on leverage,
pushing them up and making money). In 1929, call loans and investment
trusts were the fastest-growing channels for increasing leverage outside the
banking system.11
The call loan market, a relatively new innovation, developed into a huge
channel through which investors could access margin debt. The terms of call
loans adjusted each day to reflect market interest rates and margin requirements, and lenders could “call” the money at any time, given the one-day term.
Call loans created asset/liability mismatches among lenders and
borrowers, since borrowers were using short-term debt to fund the
purchases of risky long-term assets, and lenders were lending to riskier
borrowers who were willing to pay higher interest rates. One of the
classic ingredients of a debt crisis is the squeezing of lenders and
borrowers who have debt/liability mismatches that they took on during
the bubble.

–New York Times

A new group of investors entered the call loan market to lend to the crowd of
speculators. Because interest rates on call loans were higher than other
short-term rates and lenders could “call” back their money on demand, call
loans became popular as a safe place for companies to invest their extra cash.12
Foreign capital also poured in from places like London and Hong Kong. As a
historian later described it, “A great river of gold began to converge on Wall
Street, all of it to help Americans hold common stock on margin.”13 The share
of funds in the call loan market that were coming from lenders outside the
Federal Reserve System (i.e., non-banks and foreigners) rose from 24 percent
at the start of 1928 to 58 percent in October 1929.14 This added risk to the
market, since the Federal Reserve couldn’t lend to these non-banks if they
needed liquidity in a squeeze.

Investment trusts were another financial innovation that saw rapid growth
during the bubble and helped draw new speculators into the market. First
originated and popularized in Great Britain, investment trusts were companies that issued shares and invested the proceeds in the shares of other
companies.15 The well-known economist Irving Fisher praised the “wide and
well-managed diversification” that trusts provided investors who lacked
sufficient capital to buy shares in multiple companies.16 As the stock market
boomed, the number of trusts exploded. By 1929, new trusts were launching at
a rate of nearly five per week, and these offerings were taking in one-third of
the new capital raised.17

52 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

Promoters of trusts claimed that their diversification made the financial
system safer. However, the use of leverage by many trusts to amplify returns
in the bubble created risk for investors. And many speculators, unaware of
the nature of the securities and believing that the recent past would continue,
amplified this risk by taking out margin loans to lever up already-levered
trust shares.18
As stock prices soared, speculators continued to lever up and make huge
profits, attracting more buyers into the market to do the same. The more
prices increased, the more aggressively speculators bet that they would
increase still more.
At the same time, supplies of stocks were increasing as the higher prices
encouraged their production.19 During this phase of the bubble, the
more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered (even
though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), as both
lenders and borrowers found lending and buying stocks with borrowed
money to be very profitable.
The leveraging was mostly taking place in the “shadow banking” system;
banks at the time by and large did not look over-leveraged. In June 1929 banks
looked much healthier than they had prior to the 1920–1921 recession: not
only were they posting record earnings, their capital ratios were higher (17.2
percent versus 14.9 percent) and their liabilities were stickier, as time deposits
made up a greater share of their liabilities (35.7 percent versus 23.3 percent).20
A series of large bank mergers during 1929 were viewed as a further source of
strength by analysts.21 Classically, bank earnings and balance sheets look
healthy during the good times because the assets are highly valued and
the deposits that back them are there. It’s when there’s a run on deposits and the assets fall in value that banks have problems.
While the Federal Reserve governors debated the need to restrain the rapid
lending that was fueling stock speculation, they were hesitant to raise shortterm interest rates because the economy wasn’t overheating, inflation
remained subdued, and higher interest rates would hurt all borrowers, not just
speculators.22 Typically the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by
high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt
growth. That is because central banks make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or
growth—not on debt growth, the asset inflations they are producing, and
whether or not debts will produce the incomes required to service them.

–New York Times

Rather than raising its discount rate, the Fed enacted macroprudential (i.e.,
regulatory) measures aimed at constraining the supply of credit via banks.
Some of these regulatory measures included lowering the acceptance rate for
loans and increasing supervision of credit facilities.23 The Fed publicly released
a letter it had written to regional banks, deriding the “excessive amount of the
country’s credit absorbed in speculative security loans” and threatening that
banks attempting to borrow money from the Fed in order to fund such loans
might be refused.24 But these policies were largely ineffective.

Late 1929: The Top and the Crash
Tightening Pops the Bubble
In 1928, the Fed started to tighten monetary policy. From February to July,
rates had risen by 1.5 percent to five percent. The Fed was hoping to slow the
growth of speculative credit, without crippling the economy. A year later, in
August 1929, it raised rates again, to six percent. As short-term interest
rates rose, the yield curve flattened and inverted, liquidity declined,
and the return on holding short duration assets such as cash increased
as their yields rose. As loans became more costly and holding cash
became more attractive than holding longer duration and/or riskier
financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), money moved
out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value. Declining asset
prices created a negative wealth effect, which fed on itself in the
financial markets and fed back into the economy through declining
spending and incomes. The bubble reversed into a bust.

It was the tightening that popped the bubble. It happened as follows:
The first signs of trouble appeared in March 1929. News that the Federal
Reserve Board in Washington was meeting daily, but not releasing details of
the meetings, sparked rumors on Wall Street that a clampdown on speculative
debt was coming.25 After two weeks of modest declines and reports of an
unusual Saturday meeting of the Reserve Board, the stock market broke
sharply lower on March 25 and then again on March 26. The Dow fell over
four percent and the rate on call loans reached 20 percent as panic gripped
the market. Trading volumes reached record levels.26 A wave of margin calls
on small leveraged investors resulted in forced selling that exacerbated the
decline. After the Federal Reserve Board chose not to act, National City Bank
president Charles Mitchell (who was also a director of the New York Fed)
announced that his bank stood ready to lend $25 million to the market.27 This

54 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

calmed the market, rates fell, and stocks rebounded. Stocks resumed their
gains, but this foreshadowed the vulnerability of stocks to tightening in the
credit market.
While growth had moderated somewhat, the economy remained strong
through the middle of 1929. The June Federal Reserve Bulletin showed that
industrial production and factory employment remained at all-time highs
through April, and that measures of construction had rebounded sharply after
falling through the first quarter.28
After another short-lived sell-off in May, the rally accelerated and the bubble
reached the blow-off phase. Stocks rose about 11 percent in June, five percent
in July, and ten percent in August. This rally was supported by accelerating
leverage, as household margin debt rose by more than $1.2 billion over the
same three months.
Money continued to tighten. On August 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York raised its discount rate to 6 percent,29 as it became clear that macroprudential measures had failed to slow speculative lending. At the same time,
concerns about the high stock prices and interest rates caused brokers to
tighten their terms in the call loan market and raise margin requirements.
After dropping them as low as 10 percent the previous year, margin requirements at most brokers rose to 45 to 50 percent.30
The stock market peaked on September 3 when the Dow closed at 381—a level
that it wouldn’t reach again for over 25 years.
It’s important to remember that no specific event or shock caused the stock
market bubble to burst. As is classic with bubbles, rising prices required
buying on leverage to keep accelerating at an unsustainable rate, both because
speculators and lenders were near or at their max positions and because
tightening changes the economics of leveraging up.
Stocks started to decline in September and early October as a series of bad
news stories eroded investor confidence. On September 5, statistician Roger
Babson delivered a speech to the National Business Conference that warned
about a collapse in prices due to “tight money.” A 2.6 percent sell-off followed
that became known as the “Babson break.” On September 20, the collapse of
Clarence Hatry’s London financial empire on fraud charges jolted markets
and forced some British investors to raise funds by selling their American
holdings.31 On September 26, the Bank of England raised its discount rate from
5.5 percent to an eight-year high of 6.5 percent and a few European nations
followed suit.32
Together, by mid-October, these events contributed to a 10 percent sell-off in
the markets from their highs. The view among investors and columnists in the
major papers was largely that the worst was over and the recent volatility had
been good for the market. On October 15, economist Irving Fisher proclaimed
that “Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.”33

The Stock Market Crashes
Then the bottom of the market fell out. Since so much happened each day
during this period, and to give you a granular understanding, I will transition
into a nearly day-by-day account, conveying it via both my own description
and in the newsfeed.
Stocks fell sharply on Saturday, October 19, which saw the second-highest
trading volume ever in a Saturday session and the decline became self-reinforcing on the downside. A wave of margin calls went out after the close,
which required those who owned stocks on leverage to either put up more
cash (which was hard to come by) or sell stocks, so they had to sell stocks.34
Sunday’s New York Times headline read, “Stocks driven down as wave of
selling engulfs the market.”35 Still, traders widely expected that the market
would recover when it opened again on Monday. Over the weekend, Thomas
Lamont of J.P. Morgan, looking at the economy, wrote to President Herbert
Hoover that the “future appears brilliant.”36
The week of October 21 began with heavier selling. One analyst described
Monday’s waves of sell orders as “overwhelming and aggressive.”37 Trading
volume again broke records. Another wave of margin calls went out and
distressed selling among levered players was prevalent.38 But markets rallied
into the end of Monday’s session, so losses were smaller on Monday than
they’d been on Saturday.
Tuesday’s session saw small gains and Wednesday’s opened quietly. But any
hopes that the worst had passed were shattered before the market closed on
Wednesday. An avalanche of sell orders in the last hour of trading pushed
stocks down sharply, which triggered a fresh round of margin calls and more
forced selling.39 The Dow suffered what was then its largest one-day point loss
in history, falling 20.7 points (6.3 percent) to close at 305.3.
Because the sell-off was so sharp and came so late in the day, an unprecedented
number of margin calls went out that night, requiring investors to post significantly more collateral to avoid having their positions closed out when the market
opened on Thursday.40 Many equity holders would be required to sell.
Everyone who worked on the exchange was alerted to be prepared for the big
margin calls and sell orders that would come Thursday morning. Policemen
were posted throughout the financial district in the event of trouble. New
York Stock Exchange Superintendent William R. Crawford later described

56 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

“electricity in the air so thick you could cut it” before the open.41 Then the
collapse and panic came.
After a quieter opening, the avalanche of selling materialized and panic took
hold of the market.42 Sell orders poured in from across the country, pushing
down prices and generating new margin calls, which in turn pushed down
prices even more. The pace of selling was so frantic that operators struggled
to keep up. One exchange telephone clerk captured the scene well: “I can’t get
any information. The whole place is falling apart.”43 Rumors of failures swirled
and as news spread, huge crowds formed in the financial district.44 By noon of
what would become known as Black Thursday, the major indices were down
more than 10 percent.
Around midday, a small group of the biggest bankers met at the offices of J.P.
Morgan and hatched a plan to stabilize the market. “The Bankers’ Pool,” as
they were known, committed to buy $125 million in shares. Early in the
afternoon, traders acting on behalf of the bankers began to place large buy
orders above the most recent price.45 As news of the plan spread, other
investors began to buy aggressively in response and prices rose. After hitting a
low of 272 (down 33), the Dow Jones Industrial Index bounced back to close at
299, down only six points for the day.46 But as it turned out, this would just be
the first of many failed attempts to bolster the market. Below is the New York
Times front page from the next day:

After the market closed on Thursday, a group of about 35 brokers began
organizing a second effort to stabilize the market. Believing that the worst
had passed, they took out a full-page ad in the New York Times for Friday,
confidently telling the public that it was time to buy.47 That same day,
President Hoover declared, “The fundamental business of the country, that is,
production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous
basis.”48 Stocks were steady through the rest of the week, and the Sunday
papers again showed optimism that the cheapness of stocks would support a
rebound in the coming week.49
But the collapse and panic resumed on Monday the 28th as a flood of sell
orders came in from all types of investors. Notably, significant selling came

Another massive wave of margin calls went out Monday night and $150 million
of call loans had been pulled from the market before Tuesday’s open.53 The
Federal Reserve attempted to counter the collapse in credit by providing
liquidity. After a 3 a.m. meeting with his directors, New York Fed president
George Harrison announced before the market opened that the Fed would
inject $100 million in liquidity to ease the credit crunch in the money market by
purchasing government securities. Harrison needed approval from the Fed
Board in Washington, but he didn’t want to wait; instead he made the purchases
outside the regular Open Market Investment Committee account.54 Classically
the checks and balances designed to ensure stability during normal times
are poorly suited for crisis scenarios where immediate, aggressive action
is required. In the late 1920s, there were few well-established paths for
dealing with the debt implosion and its domino effects.
While the Fed’s liquidity eased credit conditions and likely prevented a
number of failures, it wasn’t enough to stop the stock market’s collapse on
what became known as Black Tuesday. Starting at the open, large blocks of
shares flooded the market and pushed prices down.55 A rumor that the
Bankers’ Pool had shifted to selling fed the panic.56 The members of the New
York Stock Exchange met at noon to discuss closing the exchange, before
deciding against it.57 The investment trusts were hit especially hard as the
leverage that buoyed returns through the bubble started to work in reverse.
Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation fell 42 percent and Blue Ridge was at
one point down as much as 70 percent before recovering somewhat.58 The Dow
closed down 11.7 percent, the second worst one-day loss in history. The market
had fallen by 23 percent over two days and problems with leveraged speculators and their lenders were already starting to emerge.

Stocks snapped back on Wednesday, rising 12.3 percent in one of the sharp
bear market rallies that classically occur repeatedly during the depression
phases of big debt crises. Following the rally, the NYSE announced that
trading would begin at noon the next day and that the exchange would be closed
on the following Friday and Saturday in order to catch up on paperwork.59
Both the Fed and the Bank of England cut rates on Thursday. The Fed
dropped its bank rate from 6 percent to 5 percent in coordination with the
Bank of England’s move to decrease its discount rate from 6.5 percent to 6
percent.60 Traders also cheered the news that call loans outstanding had fallen
by more than $1 billion from the prior week. Believing that the worst of the
forced selling had passed, markets rallied again.
But speculators looking to capitalize on the prior week’s rally raced to sell
when the market opened on Monday and stocks plunged again. By Wednesday,
the Dow was down 15 percent on the week. Stocks continued to fall the
following week as well.

corporate bonds (rated BAA and below) reached their widest level in 1929, so
the riskier corporate bonds were flat to down. That sort of market action—
equities and bonds with credit risk falling and Treasury and other low credit
risk assets rising—is typical in this phase of the cycle.
Naturally the financial and psychological impacts of the stock market plunge
began to hurt the economy. As is typical, politicians and business leaders
continued to talk up the strength of the economy, but stats showed weakness.
Industrial production had peaked in July. More timely measures of freight car
loading and steel utilization released the week of November 4 showed ongoing
declines in economic activity. Sharp drops in commodity markets added to
these worries. By mid-November, the Dow was down almost 50 percent from
its September peak.

Policy Responses to the Crash
Although the Hoover Administration’s handling of the market crash and
economic downturn is now often criticized, its early moves were broadly
praised and helped drive a meaningful stock rally. On November 13, President
Hoover proposed a temporary one percent reduction in the tax rate for each
income bracket and an increase to public construction spending of $175
million.61 Two days later, Hoover announced his plan to invite a “small
preliminary conference of representatives of industry, agriculture and labor”
to develop a plan for fighting the downturn.62 When they convened the
following week, Hoover solicited pledges from business leaders to not cut
spending on capital investment or wages, and from labor union leaders to not
strike or demand higher wages.63 On December 5, Hoover convened a conference of 400 of the most reputable businessmen at the time, which in turn
created a leadership committee of 72 of the top business tycoons of the 1920s
headed by the Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce.64 This mix of
policies was successful for a time, as was Hoover’s support for the Federal
Reserve System’s efforts to ease credit.
As mentioned, the New York Fed aggressively provided liquidity during the
crash. Within a month, it cut its discount rate from 6 percent to 5 percent and
then cut it again, to 4 ½ percent.

These policy moves combined with other steps by the private sector to
support the stock market, most notably John D. Rockefeller’s bid for one
million shares of Standard Oil Co. at $50 on November 13 (effectively flooring
the price at $50).65 On November 13, the market bottomed and began what was
to be a 20 percent rally going into December. A sense of optimism took hold.
60 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

1930–1932: Depression

News &
Federal Reserve Bulletin

By New Year’s Day of 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market’s 50
percent correction was over, which helped drive a strong rebound in the first
four months of the year.66 Stocks seemed cheap because there wasn’t much
evidence yet that company earnings would fall much, and investors were
biased by their memories of the most recent downturns (e.g., in 1907 and
1920). In both cases, the worst was over after a correction of about 50 percent,
and most assumed that events would play out similarly this time.
Helping to fuel the optimism, policy makers continued to take steps to
stimulate the economy. The Fed cut rates to 3.5 percent in March, bringing the
total rate cuts to 2.5 percent in just five months (sparking debate within the
Fed over whether it was too much stimulation and risked weakening the
dollar).67 On March 25, Congress passed two appropriation bills for state road
building and construction projects, bringing the total fiscal stimulus to about 1
percent of GDP.68
The consensus among economists, including those at the American Economic
Association and the Federal Reserve, was that the simulative policy moves
would be enough to support an economic rebound. On January 1, the New
York Times captured how sentiment had shifted since the crash, noting, “Lack
of widespread commercial failures, the absence of serious unemployment, and
robust recovery in the stock market have been factors calculated to dispel the
gloominess.”69 As a further sign of optimism, banks were actually expanding
their investments through 1930; member banks’ holdings of foreign, municipal,
government, and railroad bonds all rose.70
By April 10, the Dow had rallied back above 290. But despite stimulation and
general optimism, economic weakness persisted. First quarter earnings were
disappointing, and stocks began to slide starting in late April. In the early stages
of deleveragings, it’s very common for investors and policy makers to
underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small
rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren’t enough.

Over the second half of 1930, the economy clearly began to weaken. From May
through December, department store sales fell 8 percent and industrial
production fell 17.6 percent. Over the course of the year, the rate of unemployment rose by over 10 percent (to 14 percent) and capacity utilization fell by 12
percent (to 67 percent). Housing and mortgage debt collapsed. Still, at that
point, the decline in the economy was more akin to a shallow recession. For
example, levels of consumer spending remained above the lows of previous

As the economy weakened, the sell-off across markets resumed. Stocks ended
the period on a low note: By October of 1930, the stock market had fallen
below the lows reached in November 1929. Commodities also fell sharply.
Market analysts and investors alike were realizing that their hopes for a quick
recovery would not materialize.71 But Hoover remained optimistic.
Although the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates and the
Treasury bond market was strong, spreads continued to widen. This
increased the interest rates facing most consumers and businesses. For
example, rates rose on long-term mortgage loans, and the yields on municipal
bonds, which had performed well following the crash, began to rise as credit
anxieties developed. Some industries were hit particularly hard by the
worsening credit conditions. Railroads had large amounts of debts they
needed to roll, and were facing both tighter credit conditions and decreased
earnings.72 Because railroads were considered a vital industry, the government
wanted to support them, likely with a bailout. (The railroad industry’s
circumstances in this period parallel the struggles the auto industry faced in
the 2008 financial crisis.)

Rising Protectionism
As is common in severe economic downturns, protectionist and anti-immigrant sentiment began to rise. Politicians blamed some of the weakness
on anti-competitive policies by other countries, and posited that higher tariffs
would help reverse the slump in manufacturing and agriculture, while
restricting immigration would help the economy deal with unemployment.73
Protectionist sentiment resulted most notably in the passage of the SmootHawley Tariff Act, which imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports.
Investors and economists alike feared that the proposed 20 percent increase
in tariffs would trigger a global trade war and cripple an already weak global
economy.74 As the act neared passage in early May, a group of 1,028 economists
issued an open letter to Hoover imploring him to veto the bill if it passed in
Congress.75 Foreign governments also expressed opposition and hinted at
retaliation.76 However, tariffs—particularly on agricultural imports—were one
of Hoover’s campaign promises, so he was reluctant to renege even as the
pushback against the Smoot-Hawley tariffs became more intense.77

Stocks sold off sharply as it became clear the tariff bill would pass. After

Soon the US faced a wave of retaliatory protectionist policies. The most

which at the time took in 20 percent of American exports. Canadian policy
makers increased tariffs on 16 US goods while simultaneously lowering tariffs
on imports from the British Empire.79 As similar policies piled up in the years
that followed, they accelerated the collapse in global trade caused by the
economic contraction.

Restricting immigration (both legal and illegal), another common
protectionist response to economic weakness, was also pursued by the
Hoover administration in 1930. On September 9, Hoover put a ban on
immigration, allowing travel only for tourists, students, and working professionals, describing the policy as necessary to deal with unemployment. He
later reflected in his memoir his view that, “directly or indirectly all
immigrants were a public charge at the moment—either they themselves went
on relief as soon as they landed, or if they did get jobs, they forced others
onto relief.”80

Bank Failures Begin
Banks had largely held up well following the stock market crash, but as those
they lent to were hurt by the crash and the economy weakened, they began to
feel it. In 1930, bank net earnings declined about 40 percent compared to the
prior year, but they remained on sound footing.81 Several of the largest banks
even increased their dividends. They looked strong at the time compared to
the markets and the economy, and many analysts believed that they would be

were confined to banks in the Midwest and country banks that had a lot of
money in real estate loans, and were exposed to losses from a drought.83 While
the failures started small, they spread as credit problems spread.
By December, 1930 bank failures had become a meaningful risk to the broader
economy. Worries about the banks led to runs on them. Runs on

Before I get into the banking failures, it’s important to discuss the gold
standard, since it played an important role in determining how the 1930s debt
crisis transpired. As I described in prior sections of the book, when debts are
denominated in one’s own currency, deleveragings can generally be managed
well. Being on a gold standard is akin to having debts denominated in a
foreign currency because creditors could demand payment in gold (as was
often written into contracts), and policy makers couldn’t freely print money, as
too much printing would lead people to redeem their money for gold. So
policy makers were working with a limited toolkit until they broke the
link to gold.
The most important bank failure of this period was that of the Bank of the
United States, which had some 400,000 depositors, more than any bank in
the country at the time.84 The run on it began on December 10 because of a
false rumor. Wall Street financiers—including the heads of J.P. Morgan and
Chase—met at the New York Fed to determine whether they should provide
the $30 million that was required to save the bank. Many within the group
thought that the bank was insolvent, not simply illiquid, so they should let it
fail.85 New York Superintendent of Banks Joseph Broderick argued that its
closing “would result in the closing of at least ten other banks in the city and
… it might even affect the savings banks” (e.g., it was systemically important).
He also noted that he believed the bank to be solvent.86 Broderick’s colleagues
ultimately did not agree with him. When the bank closed its doors the next
day, it was the biggest single bank failure in history.87 The New York Times
would later refer to its failure as “The First Domino In the Depression.”88 It
was certainly a turning point for public confidence in the nation’s banking
system.
Banks are structurally vulnerable to runs because of the liquidity mismatch
between their liabilities (i.e., short-term deposits) and assets (i.e., illiquid loans
and securities), so even a sound bank can fail if it can’t sell its assets fast
enough to meet its liabilities. Because of the gold standard, the Federal
Reserve was restricted in how much it could print money, limiting how
much it could lend to a bank facing liquidity problems (i.e., act as a
“lender of last resort”). There were also legal constraints. For instance,
the Fed at the time was only allowed to give direct access to its credit to

member banks, but only 35 percent of commercial banks were
members. 89 So banks would often have to borrow from the private
sector and sell their assets in a “fire sale” to avoid failure.
The end of 1930 also saw the political winds beginning to shift. With the
downturn playing prominently in voters’ minds, the Democrats swept
Congress in the November mid-term elections. This foreshadowed FDR’s win
in the presidential election two years later.90

First Quarter, 1931: Optimism Gives Way to Gloom as Economy
Continues to Deteriorate
At the start of 1931, economists, politicians, and other experts in both the US
and Europe still retained hope that there would be an imminent return to
normalcy because the problems still seemed manageable. The bank failures of
the previous quarter were thought to be inconsequential, and not damaging to
the overall financial system.
By March, all business indexes were pointing to a rise in employment, wages,
and industrial production. Bank runs led to a less than 10 percent drop in
deposits.91 The news reflected growing economic confidence: on March 23, the
New York Times declared that the depression had bottomed, and the U.S.
economy was on its way back up.92 New investment trusts were being formed
to profit from the expected “long recovery.”93

Optimism was also bolstered by the recovery of the stock market. Through the

recede in midsummer of 1929 after the rapid
expansion of the preceding year and a half,
continued to decline at a rapid rate during the
last half of 1930, following a brief recovery in
the spring. Almost all branches of industry
shared in the decline. Employment declined,
and total income of both wage earners and
farmers decreased. At the same time wholesale
prices throughout the world declined
considerably, and retail prices also reflected this
decline, although in smaller degree.”

But the rally wasn’t sustained. Growing concerns over Europe and indications

end the quarter at 172.4, down 11.3 percent from their February highs.

The Growing Debate over Economic Policy
In a depression, the main ways that politics might play a role are by
standing in the way of the implementation of sensible economic policies
or by leading to extreme policies. These are important risks that can
make a depression worse.
After more than a year of economic contraction, the political debate over
economic policy was intensifying. By this time, more than six million people
were unemployed in the United States and there was no agreement among
policy makers and business leaders on how to deal with it.94 Understanding
this debate is key to understanding why policy makers took certain steps that
ultimately worsened the crisis. It also helps illustrate many of the classic
mistakes policy makers make when handling big debt crises.
The fiscal policy debate centered on whether or not the Federal government
should significantly ramp up spending to support the economy. Senate
Democrats, joined by some Republicans, pushed the President to increase
“direct relief” for those facing particularly difficult circumstances. That would
of course mean larger deficits and more debt, and it would mean changing the
rules of the game to shift wealth from one set of players to others, rather than
letting the game play out in a way that would provide good lessons to help
prevent such problems in the future (i.e., the moral hazard perspective). There
was also a strong belief that, if this money was just given away and not turned
into productivity, it would be wasted. So while the Hoover administration had
supported earlier fiscal stimulus, it opposed significant direct relief from the
Federal government that would “bring an inevitable train of corruption and
waste such as our nation had never witnessed.” Hoover’s administration
instead advocated for what he called “indirect relief”—a mix of policies that
included lobbying the private sector to invest and keep employment steady,
reliance on aid from state and local governments, immigration restrictions, and
macroprudential policies to encourage lending.95
While concerns over budget deficits limited stimulus spending, by 1931, the
federal government budget deficit grew to 3 percent of GDP. The deficit was
due to falling tax revenue, which had collapsed to nearly half of 1929 levels,

66 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

and an increase in social spending of about $1 billion that had been approved
the previous year. Treasury Secretary Mellon believed that balancing the
budget was a necessary first step to restore business confidence.96 Hoover
agreed for reasons he later summarized in his memoir: “National stability
required that we balance the budget.”97
Worries over the deficit and a push for austerity are classic responses to
the depression phase of a big debt crisis. Austerity seems like the
obvious response, but the problem is that one person’s spending is
another person’s income, so when spending is cut, incomes are also cut,
with the result that it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to
make significant reductions in debt/income ratios.
For all the suffering that the Depression had caused, a sense of crisis-driven
urgency hadn’t yet developed. The economy was still contracting over the first
half of 1931, but at a slower rate than the year before. Hoover was certain that
indirect relief was meeting the needs of the people and he did not see the need
to use additional fiscal supports.98 As we’ll discuss later, this ultimately tipped
the debate, and the Hoover administration to make the classic rookie
mistake of leaning too heavily on austerity and other deflationary
levers relative to more stimulative policies until the pain of doing these things
became intolerable.

Second Quarter, 1931: The Global Dollar Shortage Causes a Global
Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar
Because dollar-denominated credit was collapsing and a lot of dollar-denominated debt that required dollar credit to service it existed around the world, a
global dollar shortage emerged during the first half of 1931. Classically, there
is a squeeze in a reserve currency that is widely lent by foreign financial
institutions when there is a collapse of credit creation in that currency.
Although other currencies faced a shortage amid the credit crunch, the dollar
was particularly impacted because of its role as a global funding currency. At
the same time, falling US imports reduced foreigners’ dollar income, intensifying the squeeze. Note that virtually the same dollar squeeze dynamics
occurred in the 2008 crisis for the same reasons.

Germany was the epicenter of the emerging dollar squeeze. It had previously
faced great difficulty paying back the reparation debt it owed and had been
forced to borrow as a result. The country had become a popular destination for
the “carry trade,” in which investors would lend their dollars to Germany to
earn a higher yield than they would get in dollars and Germans would borrow
in dollars to get the lower interest rate. Once again, this type of behavior is
classic in the “good times,” when there is little perceived risk and large
cross-country credit creation, and sets up the conditions that make the “bad
times” worse when the reversal happens. At the time, Germany was highly
dependent on this flow of money that could easily be pulled, and by 1931,
American banks and companies held about a billion dollars in short-term
German bills (equal to about six percent of German GDP).99 That made both the
German borrowers and the American banks and companies very vulnerable.
Also, as is typical in such times, economies and wealth disparities fuel the rise
of populist and extremist leaders globally, with the ideological fight between
the authoritarian left and the authoritarian right. Both the German
Communist party and Hitler’s Nazi party made big electoral gains as the
German economy struggled—with the Nazis going from under 3 percent
support in the 1928 Reichstag elections to over 18 percent in September 1930.
Meanwhile, the largest party (center left Social Democratic Party) slipped to
less than a quarter of Reichstag seats.100 Together, the far right and far left
parties easily had enough parliamentary support to force Germany into an
unstable multi-party coalition government. Germany was essentially becoming ungovernable.
The global trade war made economic conditions and the dollar squeeze worse.
The collapse in global trade depressed foreigners’ dollar income, which in turn
made it harder for foreigners to service their dollar debts. As shown below, US
imports in dollars had fallen by about 50 percent from 1929 to 1931.

In a warning that would be echoed by global politicians and business leaders
in the coming months, the president of Chase National Bank acknowledged in
the August 1931 issue of Time magazine that companies’ inability to obtain
enough dollars to cover their debts was heavily affecting business. As such, he
stressed the necessity for the US government to reduce debts owed to them
from abroad.
The shortage of dollars made borrowing more expensive, creating a liquidity
squeeze in central Europe. To alleviate the liquidity squeeze and allow the

68 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

continued financing of fiscal deficits, these governments naturally turned to
some money printing (since the alternative of allowing the credit crunch to
spiral was worse). This increased inflation, raising fears of a return to the
hyperinflation of the early 1920s in Germany. In essence, Germany was facing
a balance of payments crisis. On May 7, the US Ambassador to Germany,
Frederic M. Sackett, told President Hoover of Germany’s economic strain,
listing its pockets of weakness: capital flight, currency difficulties, unemployment, global tightening of credit, pressures for debt payments, and refusals to
renew foreign held German bank accounts.101
Austria was also facing major losses. On May 8, Credit Anstalt, the oldest and
largest of Austria’s banks, announced a $20 million loss resulting partially
from its role in the rescue of another failing bank in 1929 that had nearly
wiped out its equity.102 A run ensued and this spread to a run on the Austrian
currency. When risks emerge that systemically important institutions
will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running to
limit the impact of their failure on other solvent institutions or the
economy at large. Keeping these institutions intact is also important for
keeping credit pipes in place for lending to creditworthy borrowers,
particularly for financial systems with a concentrated set of lenders.
But since Austria was on the gold standard, policy makers couldn’t print
money to provide liquidity and other frantic attempts to secure loans to
stabilize the bank failed.
Geopolitical strains made the crisis worse. France feared Austria and
Germany’s increasingly close ties. In an effort to weaken those countries, the
French government encouraged the Bank of France and other French banks to
withdraw the short-term credit they had provided to Austria.103
Viewing the interconnectedness of global financial institutions and the
weakness of Europe as potential threats to its domestic recovery, the United
States began to study methods of relieving the pressure on the German
economy. On May 11, President Hoover asked Treasury Secretary Mellon and
Secretary of State Henry Stimson to look into relaxing Germany’s significant
payments for war debts and reparations. A proposal was not put forth until
early the next month.104

outflow of capital, the bank tightened monetary policy, increasing its discount
rate to 15 percent and its collateralized loan rate to 20 percent.108

Political turmoil in Europe led funds to flow into the US, which increased
demand for US Treasuries and pushed down interest rates. In an attempt to
lessen the demand for dollars, the Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate to
1.5 percent.
On June 5, President Hoover suggested to his cabinet that all governments
grant a moratorium of a year on all intergovernmental payments. President
Paul von Hindenburg of the Weimar Republic made an appeal, stating that
Germany was in danger of collapse, which helped push Hoover to swiftly
adopt the plan.109 On June 20, Hoover officially announced his proposal for a
moratorium on Germany’s debts for one year. Under his proposal, the US
would forgo $245 million in debt service payments due over the next year
from Britain, France, and other European powers. However, in order to
receive these concessions, the allies had to suspend $385 million in reparations due from Germany.110
In what became known as the “moratorium rally,” the Dow rallied 12 percent
in the two days following Hoover’s announcement and ended the month 23
percent above the low that it had reached on June 2. German stocks rose 25
percent on the first day of trading following the announcement. Commodity
prices soared in the following weeks.

70 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

On July 6, the moratorium negotiations finally concluded. Fifteen countries
agreed to it, though the share of German reparations that were suspended in
the final agreement was lower than Hoover’s initial proposal. France refused to
participate, but did agree to re-lend their reparations back in to Germany.111 The
Dow slumped 4.5 percent on the day.
The chart below puts things in perspective; the arrow under the grey shaded
area shows the moratorium rally. Notice how insignificant that 35 percent
rally looks within the bigger moves. I can assure you that those sorts of moves
don’t seem small when you’re going through them. Throughout the Great
Depression, announcements of big policy moves like this one repeatedly
produced waves of optimism and big rallies, amid a decline that totaled almost
90 percent. Investors were repeatedly disappointed when the policy moves
weren’t enough and the economy continued to deteriorate. As noted earlier,
bear market rallies like this are classic in a depression, since workers, investors, and policy makers have a strong tendency to exaggerate the importance
of relatively small things that appear big close-up.

Third Quarter, 1931: The Debt Moratorium Fails and the Run on
Sterling Begins
It quickly became clear that the debt moratorium wasn’t going to be enough to
save Germany. In early July, rumors circulated that one of Germany’s largest
banks, Danat Bank, was on the verge of failure.112 The Reichsbank, Germany’s
central bank, viewed it as systemically important and wanted to bail it out to
avert the complete collapse of the German credit system, but it lacked the
foreign reserves needed to do that.113
On July 8, just one day after the moratorium had been finalized, Reichsbank
president Hans Luther began to reach out to policy makers from Britain to
request further negotiations of Germany’s current debts and the possibility of
a new loan. Luther needed a new $1 billion loan without political concessions.
Policy makers from the other countries balked at this—no one wanted to lend
even more to Germany.114 Hoover instead proposed a ‘standstill’ agreement,
which would require all banks holding German and Central European
short-term obligations to keep the credit extended, exposing them to big
liquidity and potential solvency problems as they needed the cash to meet
their obligations.115

German market. During the period from May 31

Naturally, banks were opposed to the standstill agreement and Treasury
Secretary Mellon implored Hoover to reconsider. Hoover would not budge.
He described his reasoning in his memoir: “This was a banker-made crisis…
the bankers must shoulder the burden of the solution, not our taxpayers.”116
Hoover’s instinct to have the banks bear the cost is a classic but
misguided policy response to a debt crisis. Punishing the banks in a way
that weakens them makes sense for a few moral and economic reasons, as
mentioned in the discussion of the archetypal template, and it can be a
political necessity as the public hates the bankers at such times—but it
can have disastrous consequences for the financial system and markets.
Without a forceful policy response in support of the banks, the collapse
continued and Germany’s depression became much worse, inciting riots across
the country.117 Hitler was gearing up to run for Chancellor; he adopted the
strongly populist stance of threatening to not repay the country’s reparation
debts at all. When the foreign ministers met in London on July 20, plans for a
new loan slowly fizzled. Ultimately they put in place a three-month extension
of an earlier loan along with a standstill agreement. The result was a classic
run on the currency as described in the archetypal template.

The Run on Sterling
Germany’s problems proved to be a key source of contagion. UK banks had
lots of loans to Germany, so they couldn’t get their money out; when foreign
investors saw that the UK’s banks were in trouble, they began to pull their
money. On July 24, France began withdrawing gold from England. This was
interpreted as a lack of confidence in the pound, which prompted more
countries to pull their deposits from Britain, and the run on sterling began.118
To defend the currency, the Bank of England sold its reserves (a third of them
in August alone) and raised interest rates, both classic moves. Foreigners were
watching the weekly declines in gold reserves, so the pressure on the pound
only increased.
The Bank of England also sought loans from abroad to support the currency,
but these loans effectively funded the flight out of sterling. On August 1, 1931,
the Bank requested that the US government organize a loan from private US
banks totaling $250 million, which Hoover urged to be done right away.119 The
flight from sterling continued and the Bank of England received another loan,
this time of $200 million from American banks and $200 million from French
banks, which was made on August 28.120 Hoover approved of them, but
acknowledged after the fact that, “Both loans, however, mostly served to
create more fear.”121

On Saturday, September 19, having exhausted all of its foreign loans and with just over £100 million in gold reserves
remaining, the Bank of England stopped supporting the pound and let it fall sharply, and of course the following
day, officially suspended gold payments, a de facto default.122 Initially, the public did not understand what going off
the gold standard would mean for their transactions. Newspapers lamented it as the end of an era.123
Sterling fell 30 percent over the next three months. On the first trading day since gold payments had been halted,
sterling dropped to $3.70, nearly 25 percent lower than its pre-default level of $4.86. British policy makers didn’t
intervene in the market to slow the fall or maintain stability. Sterling exchange rates fluctuated greatly before
dropping to a low of $3.23 in December. Over the same period, the UK’s equity market recovered and rose 11
percent in local currency terms.
Other countries followed the UK in abandoning gold convertibility so they could finally “print money” and
devalue their currencies. Most of these devaluations were roughly 30 percent (e.g., the Nordic countries,
Portugal, much of eastern Europe, New Zealand, Australia, India), in line with sterling’s devaluation. The chart,
below right, shows the depreciations for a few countries.

Investors feared that government bonds would be defaulted on with devalued money. This led to a run out of
bonds, which raised interest rates and drove bond prices down. In the United States, the Fed raised interest rates
by 2 percent in order to attract foreign capital and hold the gold peg. Each government’s bonds hit new lows in
1931. All except Switzerland’s and France’s declined at least 20 percent from their 1931 highs. Global stocks also
sold off and some markets stopped trading altogether. On September 21, only the Paris Stock Exchange was open
in Europe.124

UK stocks and bonds sold off during the currency defense phase and continued
to weaken immediately following the devaluation, but then rebounded. Because
the UK’s debt was denominated in its own currency, there wasn’t a risk that
the government couldn’t pay it back. Consistent with these pressures on the
bond market, the UK’s 5.5 percent bonds due in 1937 had dropped to $92 after
the devaluation from $104 (as interest rates rose from 4.7 percent to 5.7 percent
in December), but they moved back up to $100 by the end of the year.125
The devaluation helped stimulate the export sector of the economy and
allowed the Bank of England to ease significantly, cutting rates by one percent
by the end of the year. Equilibrium was reached so that, by the end of October,
banks in London were receiving money again. In other words, the devaluation and money printing kicked off a beautiful deleveraging (I’ll go
through this more later, when I discuss the US leaving the gold standard).
Consistent with these pressures, UK stocks and bonds both rallied after selling
off sharply through the currency defense phase and immediately following the
devaluation. It is important to understand that these moves are very classic.
Why they work as they do is explained in the archetypal template.

Fourth Quarter, 1931: The International Crisis Spreads to the US
and the Depression Worsens
As other currencies devalued and the dollar rose, it created more deflationary/
depressing pressures in the US. Sterling’s devaluation in September 1931
especially stunned global investors and sent shock waves through US markets.
Naturally investors and savers around the world began to question whether
the US was safe from either default or devaluation, so they started to sell out
of their dollar debt positions. That raised interest rates and tightened liquidity,
bringing on the most painful period of the depression, lasting until FDR took
the US off the gold standard eighteen months later to devalue the dollar and
print money.
Stocks had sold off during the run on sterling. The Dow finished September
down 30.7 percent, its largest monthly loss since the crisis began. On October
5, the market fell 10.7 percent in a single day. Amid the chaos, the NYSE once
again banned short selling in a classic attempt to slow the sell-off.126 While
previously “safe” treasury bonds had rallied as stocks crashed in 1929 and
1930, they were now selling off along with stocks, reflecting the US balance of
payments crisis. The yield on long-term US treasuries rose to 4 percent, nearly
1 percent above their midyear lows. Due to the US’s stock of debts and their
rising debt service, there were concerns about the US Treasury’s ability to roll

In September 1931, the dollar ceased to be a safe haven for the first time since
the global debt crisis began. Gold reserves began to flow out of the US
following sterling’s devaluation as central banks in France, Belgium,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands all began to convert their dollars to gold.
The US lost about 10 percent of its gold reserves within the three weeks
following the sterling devaluation.
On October 9, in an effort to attract investors, the New York Federal Reserve
Bank increased the discount rate from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent. This was no
different than tightening, which is not a path to good things in a depression.
Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large
enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for
the currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic
economy, so they don’t work. This was no exception, so a week later, the
New York Fed again raised its interest rate to 3.5 percent.129 Rumors flew that
the head of the New York Fed, George Harrison, had asked the French not to
withdraw any more gold from the United States.130
Given the domestic difficulties, investors in the US had taken to hoarding
gold and cash. This led to a series of bank runs in late 1931 that caused many
banks to close and resulted in a big contraction in deposits for those remaining open. As banks’ deposits fell, they began to call their loans in order to
build up their cash reserves. Homes and farms were forced into foreclosure,
and several companies went bankrupt as investors did not roll loans they had
previously extended.131

“During the 6-week period following the
suspension of gold payments by Great Britain
there was a decrease in the country’s stock of
monetary gold amounting to $730,000,000 and
an increase in currency outstanding of
$390,000,000. Both of these factors increased
the demand for reserve bank credit, and the
total volume of this credit, notwithstanding a
considerable decrease in member bank reserve
balances, increased by $930,000,000 during the
period, and was at the end of October at the
highest level in 10 years. The outflow of gold,
which began at the time of the suspension of

21, was the largest movement of the metal during

The Hoover administration took several steps to stem bank failures and
stimulate the flow of credit in late 1931. The most notable among these was the
creation of the National Credit Association, which provided a pool of private
money that could be lent against sound collateral to provide liquidity to banks
at risk of failing (i.e., a private central bank). The funds came from the banks
and totaled $500 million, with the ability to borrow another billion.132
At the same time, Hoover was looking for solutions for the collapsing real
estate market. To stop foreclosures on mortgages of “the homes and farms of
responsible people,” he sought to create a system of Home Loan Discount
Banks, which he did in 1932. In the meantime, he worked with both the
insurance and real estate agencies to suspend foreclosures on farm loans by
the Federal Land Banks, while providing the institution with $1 billion so that
it could expand its lending.133
The policies were well received and broadly inspired confidence among
investors. The stock market rallied in response, up 35 percent from its October
bottom to November 9, with a jump of more than 10 percent on the day the
National Credit Association was announced. The rally made some believe the
worst was over, as most significant rallies do. Yet there was no significant
change in the total money and credit available, so the fundamental imbalance

between total debt coming due and the amount of money available to service it
wasn’t resolved. As was the case with so many policy announcements throughout the depression, the rally faded as it became clear that the proposals would
be too small to handle the problem. Stocks reached a new low near the end of
December.

First Half of 1932: Growing Government Intervention Unable to
Halt Economic Collapse
The depression deepened in 1932, as the economy continued to plunge with
deflation and credit problems worsening. An astounding number of businesses
were struggling or failing—in aggregate, businesses experienced $2.7 billion in
losses and bankruptcies hit record levels, with almost 32,000 failures and
$928 million in liabilities.134 News of bank failures filled the newspapers. As
those losses rippled through the system, imposing losses on lenders and
causing other businesses to close shop, the economy contracted still more.

It is classic in a big debt crisis: Policy makers play around with deflationary levers to bring down debt for a couple of years but eventually
wake up to the fact that the depressing effects of debt reduction and
austerity are both too painful and inadequate to produce the effects
that are needed. So more aggressive policies are undertaken. As it
became clear that the Hoover administration hadn’t done enough to reverse
the credit contraction, it announced another set of policies during the first
part of 1932 in an attempt to provide liquidity to the banking system and get
credit going again.
On January 23, Hoover launched the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
The RFC was funded with $500 million in capital and had the ability to
borrow from the Treasury or private sources up to $3 billion; its goal was to
provide liquidity to solvent banks to shore them up against failure.135 The RFC
benefited from a more extensive mandate than the Federal Reserve—it was
able to lend against a wider range of collateral and to a broader range of
entities. It could also lend to state-chartered banks, banks in rural areas that
were not a part of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., some of the banks most
affected by the crisis), and railroads, which were an important industry at the
time (like the auto industry in 2008).136 Lending against a widening range
of collateral and to an increasingly wide range of borrowers is a classic
lever that policy makers pull to ensure that sufficient liquidity gets to
the financial system, sometimes provided by central banks and
sometimes by central governments.

By the end of August 1932, the RFC had lent $1.3 billion to 5,520 financial
institutions, helping to reduce the number of bank failures.137 But the RFC was
only able to lend against “good” collateral. And so it was unable to provide
sufficient support to some of the institutions that needed it the most.138
Around this time, the Fed started to experiment with money printing. Going
into the crisis, the Federal Reserve was only able to lend against gold or certain
forms of commercial paper. With both in short supply, policy makers were once
again faced with the trade-off between further tightening and undermining
the dollar’s peg to gold. The 1932 Banking Act, signed by Hoover on
February 27, attempted to alleviate the liquidity squeeze while maintaining the gold standard by increasing the Federal Reserve’s ability to print
money, but only to buy government bonds (which 75 years later would be
called “quantitative easing”).139 This move was contentious, since it was
clearly a weakening of the principles behind the gold standard, but the sense of
urgency was such that the bill passed without debate.140 As Hoover framed it,
the decision was “in a sense a national defense measure.”141, Later that year,
Congress gave the Federal Reserve additional powers to print money and
provide liquidity in an emergency.142 This provision—Section 13(3) of the
Federal Reserve Act—would end up being critical to the Fed’s response to
the 2008 debt crisis.
The Federal Reserve System bought nearly $50 million in government
securities each week in April and nearly $100 million each week in May. By
June, the system had purchased over $1.5 billion in government securities.
The following chart illustrates the Federal Reserve’s purchases and holdings
of government debt in 1931 and 1932.

Once the Federal Reserve began purchases, yields on short-term Treasury
securities fell rapidly with three month T-Bill yields falling more than two
percent over the first half of the year. Fed purchases also relieved pressure in
the market for longer-term treasury bonds, where the supply-demand imbalance for dollars had reached a breaking point amid large deficits and foreign
reluctance to hold US assets. After rising above 4.3 percent in January, yields
on ten-year treasuries fell below 3.5 percent over the next six months.
These moves ignited optimism and yet another rally, and the Dow Jones
increased by 19.5 percent, reaching January’s high. It closed above 80 in
February.

Policy makers also took a number of smaller steps to support the banking
system during the first half of 1932. Another classic move was the
abandonment of mark-to-market accounting for banks. In January, the
Comptroller of the Currency instructed bank examiners to use par value as
the intrinsic value of bonds held by national banks with a BAA rating or
better.143 Under the prior accounting methodology, banks faced either major
paper losses on the bonds they held or cash losses if they sold them. Those
losses reduced their capital, forcing them to raise money or sell assets, further
constraining liquidity and pushing down asset prices. The change in accounting rules relieved some of the most immediate pressure on banks.

Hoarding by Banks Put Before Hoover
“A charge that some banks were hoarding
money and that their restrictive credit policies

The Hoover administration also tried to get credit going with macroprudential measures, most notably applying direct pressure on banks in an
attempt to get them to lend. Hoover and Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills had
blamed the banks for their inability to stimulate credit, and accused them of
restricting loans and hoarding gold and cash. Hoover organized committees in
the twelve Federal Reserve districts which tried to pressure large regional
banks into lending, but this effort met with little success.144

Though some were helpful, none of these moves were enough to halt the
economic collapse. Pressure on US gold reserves continued because foreigners
worried that with the monetary expansion and the expanding deficit, the US
would not be able to sustain the dollar’s conversion to gold at existing rates.145
As they rushed to make the conversion, gold left the country every month
from March to June. In June net gold exports hit $206 million, a level last
experienced following the depreciation of sterling.146 That produced a tightening of credit.

volume further declined that month to about 750,000 shares per day.147 Early
in the crisis, government efforts to increase lending and spending had led to
sustained rallies in asset markets. At this stage, however, investors had
become disillusioned. They worried that Hoover’s programs were not making
enough of a difference to make up for their vast cost, and markets continued
to trend downward.

Social unrest and conflict continued to rise globally. In Germany, Hitler
won the most seats in the Reichstag election. Japan slipped toward militarism,
invading Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932. In the US, strikes and
protests were also increasing.148 Unemployment was approaching 25 percent,
and those still employed faced wage cuts. Outside of cities, farmers faced ruin
as prices fell and a drought destroyed their crops. In one dramatic expression
of discontent, thousands of veterans and their families had marched on
Washington in June (and stayed there) in an attempt to pressure the government to immediately pay them their veterans’ bonuses.149 On July 28, US Army
troops led by General Douglas MacArthur cleared the camp with tanks and
tear gas. It was at this time that conflicts both within countries and between
countries intensified, sowing the seeds of populism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and militarism that at first led to economic warfare and then military
warfare in Europe in September 1939 and with Japan in December 1941.

Second Half of 1932: Further Contractions and the Election of FDR

The downward spiral began to moderate, asset prices stabilized, and production actually increased in certain areas of the economy, like autos. From May
through June, commodities, stocks, and bonds all bottomed. Markets for both
stocks and bonds improved during the second half of the year. In August and

Time magazine’s August 8, 1932, edition claimed that the rally occurred
because the gold outflow had finally ceased, rumors had spread about the
country receiving foreign capital, and a railroad merger had been approved.
As optimism about the economy and asset markets began to increase, policy
makers began to pull back on their earlier stimulative measures. Also, the RFC
was weakened significantly by a scandal when it bailed out Central Republic
Bank and Trust, which was headed by the previous chair of the RFC. The
public was outraged—the RFC now seemed like a tool of fat-cat bankers.150 In
response, Congress ordered the RFC to publish the names of all the institutions to which they had lent.151 This effectively meant that getting a loan from
the RFC also required advertising that you were in trouble, which of course
worsened pressure from depositor withdrawals. Borrowing from the RFC
slowed, and withdrawals began to pick up pace.152

80 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

Outrage over the government’s role in “bailing out” financial institutions
is one outgrowth of the “Main Street versus Wall Street,” or “workers
versus investors” conflicts that classically occur during depressions. As
economic pain increases, populist calls to “punish the bankers that
caused this mess” make it incredibly difficult for policy makers to take
the actions that are needed to save the financial system and the
economy. After all, if the bankers quit in this chaos, the system would
certainly shut down.
Politics also played a part in ending the Fed’s purchases of government bonds.
The Banking Act passed in February had been framed as a temporary measure
due to concerns that it might weaken the dollar. Members of the Federal
Reserve from Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston pushed for ending open
market operations, arguing that since banks were accumulating increasing
reserves but not significantly expanding credit, the program was not necessary (and the lower long-term interest rates from the program were hurting
bank profitability). In July they stopped participating, and the New York Fed,
unable to continue on its own, was forced to acquiesce.153
The administration was worried about the budget deficit ballooning, as
receipts fell and expenditures rose.154 With almost universal support,
Hoover pushed to balance the budget through a mix of tax increases and
cuts to federal expenditures.155 On June 6, the Revenue Act of 1932 was
signed into law. The act increased income taxes, corporation taxes, and
various excise taxes. But despite these efforts, the budget deficit grew significantly relative to GDP because the austerity was contractionary and the
economy shrank faster than the budget deficit did.156 As mentioned earlier,
Hoover’s attempt to balance the budget through austerity was a rookie
move that is classic in depressions.
As is also classic in deleveraging scenarios, the debate about what to do
became antagonistically political, with strong populist overtones.
Roosevelt came on the scene with what, at the time, seemed like leftist
populist policies. From the outset his presidential campaign struck a strongly
anti-speculator tone. It opened with a speech that railed against securities
firms’ abuses and called for federal control of the stock and commodities
exchanges.157 There were indications that he favored a devaluation of the
dollar, which increased the pressure on the currency. To allay those fears,
Roosevelt said he would not take the country off the gold standard, but
investors were not convinced.158 By the way, politicians and policy makers
frequently make disingenuous promises that are expedient and inconsistent with economic and market fundamentals, and such promises
should never be believed.

Policy makers’ reliance on the deflationary levers of debt reduction had
pushed the US into a severe depression/“ugly deleveraging.” Since
nominal interest rates were well above nominal growth rates, debt grew faster
than income and debt burdens rose despite defaults.

But while investors were worried about the effects of a Roosevelt presidency,
the populist nature of his campaign (along with the terrible economic conditions) propelled him to victory. Roosevelt was elected in November 1932,
winning 22.8 million votes against Hoover’s 15.8 million, the most popular
votes ever won by a presidential candidate up to that time.
Driven by weak economic conditions, an uneven recovery (in which the elite
was perceived to be prospering while the common man was still struggling),
and ineffectual policy makers, populism was a global phenomenon in the
interwar period (the 1920s to the 1930s), leading to regime changes not only in
the United States, but also in Germany, Italy, and Spain. In the United States,
inequality (in both income and wealth shares) peaked in the early 1930s, but

82 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

remained high for the rest of the decade. By the time of Roosevelt’s election,
the top 10 percent earned 45 percent of the income and owned 85 percent of
the wealth while unemployment was over 20 percent. These conditions caused
FDR to base his campaign on a “New Deal,” which promised big changes for
workers, debtors, and the unemployed.160
Europe had a similar set of economic conditions. Germany had experienced
both a hyperinflation and the start of the Great Depression in the prior fifteen
years. Inequality was also high—the top 10 percent earned about 40 percent of
the income, while unemployment was over 25 percent. This set the stage for
the Nazi party’s ascent.161

1933: Preinauguration
Gold continued to flow out of the country in anticipation of Roosevelt’s
reflationary policies, and Roosevelt now refused to reaffirm his commitment
to the gold standard. Those around him attempted to persuade him to
reassure the markets. Senator Carter Glass, who was Roosevelt’s likely
nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, declared that he would not accept the
post if Roosevelt could not guarantee the country would stay on the gold
standard.162 Hoover wrote a personal letter to Roosevelt, requesting that he
clarify his policies.163 European investors in the dollar were worried: From
Paris, the New York Times reported that “the confusion of mind in Europe’s
markets concerning the future tendency of the dollar must be ascribed to lack
of information regarding the definite intentions of the new American government. Declaration by Mr. Roosevelt declaring firm resolution to maintain a
sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect.” But Roosevelt
stayed silent.164
In February, the crisis deepened. Facing bankruptcy, the Guardian Detroit
Union Group, the largest financial institution in Michigan, sought a loan from
the RFC. The group had little good collateral, so the RFC could not, under its
mandate, offer it a large loan. Perhaps more importantly, the main shareholder
of the Guardian Group was auto millionaire Henry Ford. Not wanting the
appearance of doing more favors for fat-cats, the RFC suggested that it could
make a loan if Ford also provided some support. But Ford, recognizing that
the Guardian Trust was as systemically important as the Central Republic,
refused. His attempt to call the RFC’s bluff failed. The Union Guardian Trust
and Guardian National Bank of Commerce, two of the Guardian Group’s
banks, were allowed to go bankrupt and Michigan was forced to declare a
statewide bank holiday.165
When policy makers fail to rescue systemically important institutions,
the ripple effects can quickly spread to the whole system. Since Michigan
was part of America’s industrial heartland, the impact on other states was
especially large.166 Households and companies rushed to withdraw their
savings from banks across the country. Ohio, Arkansas, and Indiana suffered
bank runs. Maryland declared a bank holiday on February 25, and by March
4, there were withdrawal restrictions in over 30 states.167

Current Banking Developments
“Demand upon the reserve banks for currency
in connection with holiday trade this year was
about $120,000,000, compared with
$225,000,000 to $275,000,000 in other recent
years. This decreased demand for currency
reflected both a diminished dollar volume of
retail trade, due chiefly to the prevailing lower
level of prices, and a continued return of
currency from hoarding. The demand for
currency did not result this year, as it usually
does, in an increase in the outstanding volume
of reserve bank credit, since additions of about
$150,000,000 of gold to the country’s
monetary stock were more than sufficient to
provide to member banks the funds necessary
for meeting currency withdrawals.”

February 25 a bank holiday was declared in
Maryland, followed within a few days by similar

In the face of this pressure on gold reserves, Hoover attempted to invoke the
War Powers Act and introduce capital controls, a classic but ineffective
response to balance of payments pressures, but the Democrats would not
allow it.169
The economy suffered enormously. In March, business had slowed to a
shocking extent. That year, the Gross National Product hit its lowest point in
the entire period of the depression at $55.6 billion, which was 31.5 percent
below its 1929 level in constant dollar terms.170

1933–1937: The Beautiful Deleveraging
1933–1934: Roosevelt Leaves the Gold Standard; the Economy
Moves to a Beautiful Deleveraging
On Sunday, March 5, the day after he took office, Roosevelt declared a
national four-day bank holiday, suspended gold exports (effectively delinking
the dollar from gold), and set a team to work on rescuing the banking system.
It was a scramble to get as much done as possible in as short a time as
possible.

March 1933
National Summary of Business Conditions
“Volume of industrial production increased in
January by less than the usual seasonal
amount, and factory employment and pay rolls
continued to decline. Prices of commodities at
wholesale, which declined further in January,
showed relatively little change in the first three

Before the banks were set to reopen on March 9, Congress passed the
Emergency Banking Act of 1933. The act extended the bank holiday and gave
the Fed and the Treasury unprecedented powers to provide liquidity and
capital to the banking system. Most important, the act granted the Fed the

84 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

ability to issue dollars that were backed by bank assets instead of gold, which
broke the link between the dollar and gold and allowed the Fed to print
money and provide the liquidity that banks desperately needed. So that
the Fed could print money without facing a run on its gold reserves, Roosevelt
banned gold exports under the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act.171
Auditors began to work through the books of each US bank, starting with the
largest banks and those known to be the safest. When auditors found a bank
that was undercapitalized, they could either (a) recapitalize the bank by
having the RFC issue preferred shares, (b) merge it with a healthier bank, or
(c) close it. Systemically important banks were always supported, while
smaller banks were often allowed to fail. Once auditors decided that a
bank was sound, it would reopen with the ability to borrow from the Fed using
any of its assets as collateral.172 As part of the Banking Act of 1933, the Treasury
agreed to cover any losses the Fed incurred, effectively guaranteeing the
liabilities of every bank that they chose to keep open.173
On Sunday, March 12, the night before the first wave of banks was set to
reopen, Roosevelt gave a nationwide radio address explaining the plan for the
banks and seeking to restore trust in the banking system:
The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue
additional currency on good assets and thus the banks which reopen
will be able to meet every legitimate call…It is sound currency because
it is backed by actual, good assets…I can assure you that it is safer to
keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.174
As banks in twelve cities prepared to open on Monday, policy makers and
investors waited nervously to see how the public would respond. Instead of
bank runs, the public proceeded to deposit more than $1 billion into the banks,
which is a classic example of how debt and liquidity problems prompted by
runs can be rectified by providing liquidity rather than holding it back. Banks
continued to reopen in the days that followed, and within a month member
banks representing 90 percent of the deposits in the system had reopened.175
When markets finally opened on Wednesday, the Dow rose 15.3 percent and
commodities also soared.
To get all that money, the link to gold had to be broken. But with all that
printing, the dollar’s value plunged against both other currencies and gold.
This was virtually identical to what happened in August 1971, when I was
clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and thought that the
crisis would send the stock market and economy down. What happened was
the same as what happened in 1933, and for the same reasons, but I hadn’t
studied what happened in 1933, so I was painfully wrong. That was the first
time that I was surprised by events that hadn’t happened in my lifetime but
had happened many times in history. Being stung by these experiences drove
me to try to understand all big market and economic movements in all time
frames and all economies and to have timeless and universal principles for
dealing with them. That saved my butt a number of times (e.g., in 2008). The
events I am describing to you that happened in the 1930s have happened many
times before for the exact same reasons.

Within two weeks of leaving the gold peg, the Federal Reserve was able to
decrease its liquidity injections; short-term rates decreased by one percent to
two percent, bankers’ acceptance rates dropped back to two percent, and call
loan rates decreased to three percent.176 The money supply increased by 1.5
percent over the next three months, and the Dow was up by almost 100 percent
over the next four months. These moves ended the depression on a dime. (Most
people mistakenly think that the depression lasted through the 1930s until
World War II so I want to be clear on what actually happened. It is correct that
it took until 1936 for GDP to match its 1929 peak. But when you look at the
numbers in the charts below, you can see that leaving the gold peg was the
turning point; it was exactly then that all markets and economic statistics
bottomed. Still, these average numbers can be misleading because the recovery
benefited the rich more than the poor, and the post-1933 period remained more
difficult for a lot of people than the averages suggest, which is likely why
people often think of the depression as lasting through the entire decade.)

While leaving the gold standard, printing money, and providing guarantees
were by far the most impactful policy moves that Roosevelt made, they were
just the first of an avalanche of policies that were unrolled during his first six
months in office. The shock and awe of all those big announcements of
spending, coming week after week, built confidence among investors and the
public, which was critical to putting the economy on a good footing. I’ll
describe some of those policies below, not because the particulars are all that
important, but because together they paint the picture of a bold, multifaceted,
and comprehensive policy push.
While they were still working to shore up the banks, policy makers shifted
their attentions to significantly increasing financial industry regulation
and oversight. Changing laws in ways that would have made the last crisis
less bad are typical at the end of big debt crises. When you read through
them, focus on how they map to the template for handling debt problems.
••

April 5 and 18: Roosevelt took additional steps to delink the dollar
from gold. First he outlawed ownership of monetary gold by the public
through an executive order. Two weeks later, he outlawed private gold
exports and indicated support for legislation that would allow him to
set the price of gold.177 (devaluing and printing money)

••

May 27: Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933, which would
regulate the sale of securities.178 (increased regulation)

••

June 5: Congress banned the relatively common “Gold Clauses” in
contracts, a provision that allowed the payee to opt to be paid in gold.
Since gold had increased in value after the dollar was delinked from it,
this amounted to a big restructuring of debts.179 (restructuring debts)

Roosevelt also announced new federal agencies and programs that added up
to an unprecedented fiscal stimulus. Federal spending had fallen by more than
$1 billion in 1932 as Hoover tightened fiscal policy in an attempt to balance
the budget. Even though he initially campaigned to balance the budget, FDR’s
policies would end up increasing annual spending by $2.7 billion (5 percent of
GDP) by 1934. These are some of the early stimulus bills:
••

April 5: Established the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which
would employ 2.5 million people in public works projects over its nine
years of existence.182

••

May 12: Established the Federal Emergency Relief Act to provide
financial support to households with an initial funding of $500
million.183

••

May 18: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) undertook massive
infrastructure investment, providing power, flood control, and
irrigation in one of the regions most affected by the Great Depression.184

••

Public Works Administration (PWA), which had $3.3 billion at its
disposal to spend on large-scale public works. 185

As a result of all of this stimulation, deflation turned into acceptable rather
than horrible inflation.

The economy roared to life over the next three months as terribly depressed
levels of activity quickly became less terrible. Heavy machinery orders climbed
by 100 percent, and industrial production increased by almost 50 percent.
Between March and July nondurable manufacturing production increased 35
percent while durable manufacturing increased 83 percent. Unemployment fell
and over the next three months, wholesale prices jumped by 45 percent.186
These were all rebounding from very depressed levels and fed on
themselves to make a beautiful deleveraging.

As explained in the “Archetypal Long-Term Debt Cycle” section,
balance is key in achieving a “beautiful deleveraging”: Deleveragings
become beautiful when there is enough stimulation to offset the deflationary forces and to bring the nominal growth rate above the nominal
interest rate.

1935: The Goldilocks Period
The economy and the markets continued to recover through 1934 and into
1935, when the Federal Reserve began contemplating tightening once again.
By 1935 the economy had recovered, deflation had disappeared, and stock
prices had soared as a result of the Fed’s earlier policies. At the time, home
prices were rising faster than 10 percent per year, and the recovery in equity
prices was even faster. The boost to wealth was big, though wealth and
economic output remained below pre-depression, bubble levels.

Reserve policy in years.”
–New York Times

In the spring of 1935, the Fed became increasingly concerned about the rise in
excess reserves.187 It feared that the surge in excess reserves could create an
expansion in credit and inflation in the future. In March, a background memo
was prepared to address the question of what the Fed should do. It recommended no action for the time being. The paper explored the question of
whether excess reserves will encourage banks to lend more to the private
sector by pushing down the yield on government securities, but it didn’t yet
see evidence of that happening, so the Fed held pat. A second issue the paper
looked at was how to sell the debt that it accumulated (i.e., how to do a reverse
Q.E.).188 The paper rejected doing this for the time being, expressing the view
that it would prematurely give too much weight to inflation concerns that
hadn’t yet shown signs of materializing, and instead advocated encouraging
the expansion.
The cyclical expansion and advances in the stock market and housing price
gains continued, which caused the Fed to become more inclined to tighten. In
October, another memo expressed heightened concerns over the excess
reserves, pondering the appropriate time to reduce them and whether to do
that through 1) asset sales or 2) increasing the reserve requirement. In
November, the pros and cons of these paths were explored. The argument for
reducing excess reserves was to get ahead of the potential for future inflation;
the argument against it was that there was no evidence yet for restraint.
In its press release of November 22, the Fed discussed the stock market boom
and expressed concerns about inflation. Fears of fueling a bubble were
rampant because a number of policy makers, including FDR, remembered that
the bubble of the late 1920s caused the stock market bust, which had contributed to the depression. As a result, they were very worried that the steep rise
in the stock market in 1935 (nearly a quadrupling!) could fuel a recurrence.
The November press release from the Treasury disagreed, noting that inflation was still far off.189
The Fed paid a lot of attention to how the stock purchases were being financed
because they had heightened concerns about “speculative credit” after the
excess in margin-borrowing during the late 1920s. Raising margin requirements was considered. However, the November Fed memo noted that the
purchases were being financed by money, not credit, so no action was taken.190
Still, the stock market advance was considered an emerging bubble, and fears
about too easy of a monetary policy remained, so the arguments about whether
or not to apply restraints continued. One board member (George Harrison of
the New York Fed) suggested raising reserve requirements to curtail the rise in
stock prices. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau (still on the Fed Board at
the time) rejected this notion. However, he recognized the concern that a rise
in reserves could lead to inflation. In December, Emanuel Goldenweiser, the
Fed’s head of research, warned of a potential negative psychological reaction to
raising reserve requirements. He recommended that the Fed issue a press
release saying that any action on reserve requirements would be “precautionary” in nature, and thought that “there is no need to worry about inflation at
this time with the very large volume of unused plant capacity and unemployment.” At the end of 1935, following its last meeting, the Fed issued a press
release stating that the volume of reserves and gold inflows “continues to be
excessive” and warned that “appropriate action may be taken as soon as it
appears in the public interest.”191

The debate continued at the start of 1936. FDR wanted to signal a concern
around inflation ahead of the election, so he urged that reserve requirements
be tightened that spring. Fed Chairman Eccles was worried that banks would
accumulate a lot of bonds and loans at low rates and then get burned by
inflation.192

January 26, 1936
Raising of Margins Viewed as Gesture
“The action of the board of governors of the
Federal Reserve System on Friday in raising
margin requirements, effective on Feb. 1, was
designed primarily to check the spread of
inflationary psychology, in the opinion of
bankers and brokers as expressed yesterday.”
–New York Times

In May the Fed did not move. While the Banking Act of 1935 meant Treasury
Secretary Morgenthau had to resign from the board, he still had influence and
was a strong proponent against acting. By that July, Fed Chairman Eccles met
alone with FDR, explaining his intention to raise reserves and assuring the
president he would not act if he felt interest rates would rise and that the Fed
would buy bonds if they sold off. The Fed tightened reserves later that month.
Eccles and the Fed moved without informing Morgenthau, who was furious.
After a tiny sell off in bonds, Morgenthau ordered Harrison of the New York
Fed to purchase bonds using the Treasury’s accounts. The Fed Board in
Washington joined in, buying bonds and selling bills as Eccles had promised
the president.193 Between August 1936 and May 1937, the Fed doubled reserve
requirements from about 8 percent to 16 percent, as shown below. The first
tightening, in August 1936, did not hurt stock prices or the economy.
It is typically the case that the first tightening does not hurt stocks and
the economy.
Because the tightening did not have an effect, reserves were tightened more in
two additional phases, the first in March 1937 and the second in May 1937.
The largest increase was the first (about half the total), as shown below.

As a result of the reserve tightening, excess reserves fell from $3 billion to less
than $1 billion.194,
The tightening of monetary policy was intensified by currency devaluations by
France and Switzerland, continuing a battle of official devaluations to gain
price and trade advantages. In September 1936, the Tripartite Agreement was
reached by the United States, Britain, and France, which essentially stated
that each nation would refrain from competitive exchange devaluations.195 By
then, it had become obvious that all countries could just as easily devalue their
currencies in response to other devaluations, creating a huge amount of
economic turbulence that left everyone in the same place. At the end of the
day, all currencies had devalued a lot against gold, but not so much against
each other.

By 1936, war was brewing in Europe, driving capital flight to the US, which
continued to fuel advances in stocks and the economy. That year, the president
and other policy makers were becoming increasingly concerned by gold
inflows (which allowed faster money and credit growth).196 The concerns were
threefold:

1.

The rapid rise in the stock market. At this time, stocks were up almost
four times from their bottom in 1933 and were rising fast: by about 40
percent in 1935 and 25 percent in 1936. Policy makers worried that
the gold inflows were coming from foreigners bringing in capital to
buy US stocks.

2.

The inflationary impact of gold inflows increasing the monetary base.
Inflation had risen from roughly 0 percent to around 2 percent in
October 1936.

3.

The US was becoming vulnerable to an outflow of gold (i.e., capital
withdrawal). The specific concern was that the European nations
would finance the coming war in part by selling their US assets and
pulling gold out, while preventing US holders of their assets from
repatriating capital.

To neutralize the effects of these inflows, in December, FDR ordered
“sterilization” to begin. Normally, when people sold their gold to the US
government in exchange for dollars, the number of dollars increased (i.e.,
money is printed), which, given the strong economic recovery, wasn’t seen as
desirable. Instead, starting December 23, the gold inflows/newly mined gold
were sterilized—literally, the Treasury purchased gold inflows by drawing
down its cash account at the Federal Reserve instead of printing money. From
the end of 1936 to July 1937, the Treasury sterilized about 1.3 billion of gold
inflows (approximately 1.5 percent of GDP).197 We can see the increase in
sterilization and slowing of gold and other asset purchases in 1936/37 with
money growth slowing and dropping below gold reserve growth. The Fed also
tightened reserve requirements in order to take money out of circulation, as
we have seen.

The economy remained strong going into early 1937. The stock market was
still rising, industrial production remained healthy, and inflation picked up to
around 5 percent. The second tightening came in March 1937 and the third in
May. While neither the Fed nor the Treasury anticipated that the increase in
required reserves combined with the sterilization program would push rates
higher, the tighter money and reduced liquidity led to a sell-off in bonds and a
rise in the short rate.198 Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was furious and
argued that the Fed should offset the “panic” through open market operations
to make net purchases of bonds. He ordered the Treasury into the market to
purchase bonds itself. Fed Chairman Eccles pushed back on Morgenthau,
urging him to balance the budget and raise tax rates to begin to retire debt.199
Additionally there was a fiscal tightening. Federal government outlays fell 10
percent in 1937 and another 10 percent in 1938. The Revenue Act of 1937 was
passed to help to close loopholes in the Revenue Act of 1935 (which was sold
as the “wealth tax”).200 That act had increased the federal income tax for the
highest incomes up to 75 percent.
The federal budget deficit went from around ­-4 percent of GDP to neutral. The
reversal in the budget in 1937 was a consequence of a large increase in taxes,
mostly from a rise in the Social Security tax, along with sizable but smaller
cuts in spending.201
There was significant pressure on the government to pass redistributive
policies, as the recovery thus far was perceived to be uneven (i.e., benefiting
the elites over the common man). Workers saw the gains in corporate profits,
but didn’t see a subsequent increase in their own compensation. Inequality
bred discontent, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the number and
intensity of strikes from 1936 to 1937 (the number of strikes rose by 118 percent
and the number of workers involved by 136 percent).202
In financial markets, the combination of monetary and fiscal tightening
created a significant sell-off in risky assets. Stocks fell the most, but home
prices stopped their gains and dipped negative. Credit growth slowed as well,
both in aggregate and across all sectors. Nonfinancial business credit creation
fell to almost -2 percent, and household credit creation was slightly less
negative at about -1 percent. Spending and economic activity fell as a result.
With that downturn, unemployment rose to 15 percent, though it was more
like a short uptick, especially in comparison to the punishingly high rise at the
start of the decade. Stocks bottomed a year later, in April 1938, declining a
total of nearly 60 percent!

“Total deposits at weekly reporting member
banks continued to decrease in April and May,
reflecting declines in bankers’ balances and in
United States Government deposits. Other
deposits, which had declined somewhat in
March, increased slightly in the following
weeks. Sales of securities by banks have been
the most important factor in accounting for the
decrease in deposits in recent months. Member
bank holdings of United States Government
obligations continued to decline at New York
City banks during April and May, but the decline
was less rapid than in earlier months, and
holdings of other reporting banks showed little
change. Commercial loans by banks increased
further, although after the first week of April the
rapid growth of previous weeks slackened.”

System Action to Meet Seasonal Needs
“In the monetary field the principal
development of the month was the adoption by
the Federal Open Market Committee of a
program of supplying member banks with
additional reserve funds with which to meet
seasonal currency and credit demands. On
September 13 the Committee issued the
following statement: ‘The Federal Open Market
Committee met in Washington on September
11 and 12 and reviewed the business and credit
situation. In view of the expected seasonal
demands on the banks for currency and credit
during the coming weeks the Committee
authorized its Executive Committee to purchase
in the open market from time to time sufficient
amounts of short term U. S. Government
obligations to provide funds to meet seasonal
withdrawals of currency from the banks and
other seasonal requirements. Reduction of the
additional holdings in the open market portfolio
is contemplated when the seasonal influences
are reversed or other circumstances make their
retention unnecessary.’”

Late 1937–1938: Policy Makers Reverse Their Course
As markets and the economy turned down in 1937, the Fed accelerated a twist
into longer-dated assets and started to do a small amount of net asset
purchases. By the end of the year, the Treasury began to reverse its sterilization program in partnership with the Fed.203 Money growth picked up again
starting in 1938 and continued to rise with the reverse sterilization and
renewed money printing. At the same time, gold inflows slowed and the
economy and asset prices deteriorated. Before long, money growth had
outpaced growth in gold reserves.
The Fed’s twist is shown below. While the Fed didn’t do much in the way of
net asset purchases, it accelerated its buying of long-term bonds in 1937 while
selling bills and notes (a process it had actually started in 1936). It also
increased net assets by a small amount (slightly above 3 percent by 1938).

In the spring of 1938, the Fed added to the stimulus by lowering its reserve
requirements back to 1936 levels, releasing about $750 million.204 The federal
government also increased deficit spending that year and again in 1939 heading
into the war. While the government was almost running a balanced budget at
the start of 1938, the deficit rose to almost 3 percent of GDP by the start of
1939. Deficit spending above 2 percent of GDP continued throughout the year.
In 1938, the stock market began to recover, though stocks didn’t fully regain
their 1937 highs until the end of the war nearly a decade later. Credit flows
and the economy also recovered in 1939, following the stimulus and entry into
the war.

94 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

The Path to War
While the purpose of this chapter has been to examine the debt and economic circumstances in the United States
during the 1930s, the linkages between economic conditions and political conditions, both within the United
States and between the United States and other countries—most importantly Germany and Japan—cannot be
ignored because economics and geopolitics were very intertwined at the time. Most importantly, Germany and
Japan had internal conflicts between the haves (the Right) and the have-nots (the Left), which led to more
populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders who were given special autocratic powers by their
democracies to bring order to their badly-managed economies. They also faced external economic and military
conflicts arising as these countries became rival economic and military powers to existing world powers.
The case is also a good example of Thucydides’s Trap205—where rivalries between countries lead to wars in order
to establish which country is more powerful, which are then followed by periods of peace in which the dominant
power/powers get to set the rules because no country can fight them until a rival power emerges, at which time
they do it all over again.
To help to convey the picture in the 1930s, I will quickly run though the geopolitical highlights of what happened
from 1930 until the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. While
1939 and 1941 are known as the official start of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the wars really started about
10 years before that, as economic conflicts that were at first limited progressively grew into World War II. As
Germany and Japan became more expansionist economic and military powers, they increasingly competed with
the UK, US, and France for both resources and influence over territories. That eventually led to the war, which
culminated in it being clear which country (the United States) had the power to dictate the new world order. This
has led to a period of peace under that world order and will continue until the same process happens again.
More precisely:
••

In 1930, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff began a trade war.

••

In 1931, Japan’s resources were inadequate, and its rural poverty became severe, so it invaded Manchuria,
China to obtain natural resources. The US wanted to keep China free from Japanese control and was
competing for natural resources—especially oil, rubber, and tin—from Southeast Asia, while at the same
time Japan and the US had significant trade with each other.

••

In 1931, the depression in Japan was so severe that it drove Japan off the gold standard, leading to both the
floating of the yen (which depreciated greatly) and big fiscal and monetary expansions that led to Japan
being the first country to experience a recovery and strong growth (which lasted until 1937).

••

In 1932, there was a lot of internal conflict in Japan, which led to a failed coup and a massive upsurge in
right-wing nationalism and militarism. During the period from 1931 to 1937, the military took over control
of the government and increased its top-down command of the economy.

••

In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany as a populist promising to exercise control over the bad economy,
to bring order to the political chaos of the democracy of the time, and to fight the communists. Within just
two months of being named chancellor, he was able to take total authoritarian control; using the excuse of
national security, he got the Reichstag to pass the Enabling Act, which gave him virtually unlimited powers
(in part by locking up political opponents and also by convincing some moderates that it was necessary).
He promptly refused to make reparations payments, stepped out of the League of Nations, and took control
of the media. To create a strong economy and attempt to bring prosperity to the people, he created a topdown command economy. For instance, Hitler was involved with setting up Volkswagen to build a more
affordable car, and directed the building of the national German Autobahn (highway system). He believed
that Germany’s potential was limited by its geographic boundaries, that it didn’t have adequate raw
materials to feed the industrial military complex, and that German people should be ethnically united.

••

At the same time, Japan became increasingly strong with its top-down command economy, building a
military industrial complex, with the military intended to protect its bases in East Asia and Northern
China and to expand its controls over other territories.
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 95

••

Germany also got stronger by building its military industrial complex and looking to expand and claim
adjacent lands.

••

In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing
the right-wing, militaristic and nationalistic movement. Because the free market wasn’t working for the
people, that led to the strengthening of the command economy.

••

In 1936, Germany took back the Rhineland militarily, and in 1938, it annexed Austria.

••

In 1936, Japan signed a pact with Germany.

••

In 1936–7, the Fed tightened, which caused the fragile economy to weaken, and other major economies
weakened with it.

••

In 1937, Japan’s occupation of China spread, and the second Sino-Japanese War began. The Japanese took
over Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants
in the capture of Nanking alone. The United States provided China’s Chiang Kai-shek government with
fighter planes and pilots to fight the Japanese, thus putting a toe in the war.

••

In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and World War II in Europe officially began.

••

In 1940, Germany captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.

••

During this time, most companies in Germany and Japan remained publically owned, but their
production was controlled by their respective governments in support of the war.

••

In 1940, Henry Stimson became the US Secretary of War. He increasingly used aggressive economic
sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of July 2, 1940. In October, he ramped
up the embargo, restricting “all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the
Western Hemisphere.”

••

Beginning in September 1940, to obtain more resources and take advantage of the European
preoccupation with the war on their continent, Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia, starting
with French Indochina. In 1941, Japan extended its reach by seizing oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies
to add the “Southern Resource Zone” to its “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The “Southern
Resource Zone” was a collection of mostly European colonies in Southeast Asia, whose conquest would
afford Japan access to key natural resources (most importantly oil, rubber, and rice). The latter, the
“Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,” was a bloc of Asian countries controlled by Japan, not (as they
previously were) the Western powers.

••

Japan then occupied a naval base near the Philippine capital, Manila. This threatened an attack on the
Philippines, which was, at the time, an American protectorate.

••

In 1941, to aid the Allies without fully entering the war, the United States began its Lend-Lease policy.
Under this policy, the United States sent oil, food, and weaponry to the Allied Nations for free. This aid
totaled over $650 billion in today’s dollars. The Lend-Lease policy, although not an outright declaration of
war, ended the United States’ neutrality.

••

In the summer of 1941, US President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of all Japanese assets in the United States
and embargoed all oil and gas exports to Japan. Japan calculated that it would be out of oil in two years.

••

In December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and British and Dutch colonies in Asia. While it didn’t
have a plan to win the war, it wanted to destroy the Pacific Fleet that threatened Japan. Japan supposedly
also believed that the US was weakened by both fighting a war in two fronts (Europe and the US) and
by its political system; Japan thought that totalitarianism and the command military industrial complex
approaches of their country and Germany were superior to the individualistic/capitalist approach of the
United States.

These events led to the “war economy” conditions explained at the end of Part 1.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 101

US Debt Crisis and Adjustment
(2007–2011)

US Debt Crisis and Adjustment
(2007–2011)
This section provides a detailed account of the most recent big US debt crisis,
focusing on the period from 2007 to 2011. It was written with reference to the
template laid out in the “Archetypal Big Debt Cycle” section but also pays close
attention to the enormous number of particulars that occurred during this
period. Please note how well the particulars of this case fit with the generalizations described in the template. For example, when you read about the pooling
and securitization of mortgages, the levering up of investment banks, and the
rapid growth of derivatives that were traded off of regulated exchanges, see
these as new ways of providing leverage outside the protection and regulation of
authorities. If you don’t make the connection between the particulars of this case
and the generalization, then you will miss how classic this debt crisis really was.
In providing you with this narrative, I’m also hoping to convey an up-close
feeling of what it was like to go through the experience day-by-day. I encourage
you, at each point, to think about what you would do a) as an investor and b) as a
policy maker. I will give you that experience by describing the timeline week-byweek (and sometimes day-by-day), while showing on the sides of each page a
“newsfeed” (primarily New York Times articles). I will also include excerpts
from Bridgewater Daily Observations, which show what we were thinking at
the time. However, I will not describe how we moved our investment positions
around because how we do that is proprietary. Because there is so much here,
I’ve organized it so that it’s easy to skim by reading just the bold passages.

The Emerging Bubble: 2004–2006
In the early and healthy part of the typical debt cycle, debt grows appropriately in line with income growth because the debt is being used to finance
activities that produce fast income growth to service debts. The debt-to-GDP
ratio is a proxy of whether or not this is happening in a balanced way, but a
rough one because, at first, the amount of income a debt will produce is a
matter of conjecture. During the 1990s, debt-to-GDP ratios increased only a
little in the US—and it was a period of relatively strong income growth and
low unemployment. The 2001 recession, which was caused by the tightening
of monetary policy, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the shock of the
9/11 terrorist attacks, prompted the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates all
the way from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. Note how close the US rate was to 0
percent at this point. The big rate cuts stimulated borrowing and spending,
especially by households. This made the 2001 recession a short-lived and
shallow one, but it set the stage for the subsequent bubble period, which was
building most rapidly between 2004 and 2006.
During this period, US economic conditions looked excellent by most
measures. Growth was relatively steady at 3 to 4 percent, the unemployment
rate was below its long term average at between 4 and 5 percent, and inflation
was mostly between 2 and 3.5 percent—a bit higher than desirable, but not
worrisome by traditional measures. At the same time, the economy was
classically entering its “late cycle” phase as capacity constraints began to
appear (e.g., the GDP gap was 2 percent and growth in demand was above

The U.S. Housing Bubble
“The US housing market started to look frothy a
few years back and now looks to us to be in a
full-blown bubble. The housing market has been
a major source of strength to the US economy,
and the popping of this bubble would have
more dire consequences than an equity market
fall. Selling one’s house at a loss can be very
traumatic—it is the largest and most leveraged
asset of the household sector. Losing equity in
one’s house can devastate the household
sector’s net worth, and losing more than one’s
equity can paralyze the economy (e.g., most
people couldn’t sell their homes, which means
that they couldn’t move).”

Steep Rise in Prices for Homes Adds to Worry
About a Bubble
“Home prices rose more quickly over the last
year than at any point since 1980, a national
group of Realtors reported yesterday, raising
new questions about whether some local
housing markets may be turning into bubbles
destined to burst...Over all, home prices have
never fallen by a significant amount, and Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said on Friday that a national drop in
price remained unlikely.”
–New York Times

growth in capacity). Financial and housing markets were very strong,
financed by debt. The Federal Reserve, focusing on growth, inflation, and the
GDP gap more than debt growth, increased interest rates gradually, from the
lows of 1 percent in 2004 to just over 5 percent in 2006.
That was not enough to slow debt-financed asset appreciation. Over those
three years, the S&P 500 returned 35 percent, as earnings grew by 32 percent.
While these 10 percent per year gains were good, they were not anywhere near
the gains seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. With the economy
strong, inflation moderate, and asset prices appreciating well, the economy
appeared to most people as though it was in a “Goldilocks” period—not too
hot and not too cold. Debt/GDP grew at an average rate of 12.6 percent during
the period. Typically that’s when bubbles emerge because central banks
focus on inflation and growth (which isn’t a problem) and they don’t
adequately worry about debt-financed purchases of investment assets.
Because debt bubbles typically emerge in one or a couple of markets, they
are often hidden beneath the averages and can only be seen by doing pro
forma financial stress tests of the significant areas to see how they would
hold up and what the knock-on effects of them not holding up would be.

The Housing Market Debt Bubble
In this case, the most important area in which the bubble was emerging was
housing. From 2004 to 2006, home prices increased around 30 percent and
had increased more than 80 percent since 2000, supported by increasingly
liberal lending practices. That was the fastest pace of real housing price
increases in a century, except for the immediate post-WWII period. The price
rise was classically self-reinforcing in a way that often creates bubbles.
Because most houses are bought with borrowed money, home price gains
have magnified impacts on equity values. For example, if a household used
their savings of $50,000 as a down-payment on a $250,000 house, and that
house went up in value to $350,000, then the household’s investment tripled.
This allowed for more borrowing and attracted other buyers and other lenders
to finance them, as this lending was very profitable.

Household debt rose from 85 percent of household disposable income in 2000 to
about 120 percent in 2006. Credit standards were lowered, and while all income
quintiles increased their debt substantially over the period, the biggest percentage
increase in debt between 2001 and 2007 was among borrowers in the bottom
quintile of income earners.1 As mortgage lending practices became more liberal,

even non-home buyers ran up debts by borrowing against their home equity—
home equity loans and cash-out refinancing totaled $500 billion in 2005, up five
times compared to 1998.2 That pushed overall US debt to over 300 percent of GDP.
The more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered
(even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), but
both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying houses on
borrowed money to be very profitable. The credit-fueled buying drove up
prices even more, creating self-reinforcing expectations and drawing in new
borrowers/lenders who did not want to miss out on the action. This is classic
in bubble periods.

The US housing market was showing every sign of a classic bubble. To
repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:
1)

Prices are high relative to traditional measures.

2) Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these
high levels.
3) There is broad bullish sentiment.
4) Purchases are being financed by high leverage.
5) Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases
(e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to
speculate or protect themselves against future price gains.
6) New buyers (i.e., those who weren’t previously in the market)
have entered the market.

–New York Times

7) Stimulative monetary policy helps inflate the bubble, and tight
policy contributes to its popping.
All of these were true for the US housing market. Prices rose quickly and were
widely expected to continue doing so (e.g., “home flippers” would buy a home,
do some renovations, and aim to take advantage of rising prices to make a
short-term profit). Homebuilders were ramping up supply that wouldn’t come
on line for months or years, in anticipation of high prices being sustained—new
single family home construction doubled between 1995 and 2005.3 As people
saw their friends and neighbors becoming richer through homeownership, more
people wanted to buy homes. At the peak of the bubble, just shy of 8 percent of
households were buying a home each year (around 50 percent more than today).
A TIME magazine cover from the summer of 2005 (roughly the peak) conveyed
the speculative mania, asking “Will Your House Make You Rich?”

In other words, there was leveraging up to bet more aggressively on
prices continuing to increase. At the same time, supplies were increasing as the higher prices encouraged production. Logic should dictate
precisely the opposite behavior: those betting on price changes ought to
be more inclined to deleverage or sell, and those who lend to them
should be more cautious when these things are happening. However,
this sort of nonsensical thinking is typical in bubbles.
Just as there was a mania to buy houses, there was a mania to lend to people
to buy houses. The chart on the left on the next page shows aggregate
mortgage rates. As a result of the Fed’s easy monetary policies, they fell to
lows in 2003 not seen since the 1950s, and stayed near those lows well into
the housing bubble. Leveraging up took off in 2003-2007, even after rates
rose by about 1.5 percent in 2005-2007. The chart on the right shows the
loan-to-value ratio of new housing loans—higher numbers mean mortgages
had smaller down-payments and larger loans. The fast increase to 80 percent
was an indication that banks were more eager to loan and willing to make
riskier bets. Other signs of housing loan froth were common. Banks often
didn’t require borrowers to show proof of income before receiving a mortgage
and they pushed adjustable rate mortgages that enticed borrowers with low
“teaser” rates now before rates increased later on. “Subprime” mortgages
(e.g., riskier ones) became 20 percent of the market. And as we’ll discuss later

in much more detail, banks were able to package this debt in ways that
obscured its underlying risks (i.e., “securitization”), helping fuel the easy

For all of the debt build-up and frenzied housing activity, the economy didn’t
overheat and inflation remained moderate, so the Fed, looking at the average
numbers, remained unconcerned. It is typically the case that the worst
debt bubbles (e.g., the US in 1929, Japan in 1989) are not accompanied by
high and rising goods and services inflation, but by asset price inflation
financed by debt growth. Typically, central banks make the mistake of
accommodating the debt growth because they are focused on goods and
services inflation (as measured by the CPI) and/or growth. They are not
focused on debt growth, which is what they are creating, and on
whether the debts will produce the incomes to service them, which is
what they should be thinking about if they want to prevent bad debt crises.

As you can see in the charts below, as inflation was mostly between 2 and 3.5
percent—a bit higher than desirable but not worrisome—the Fed kept interest
rates low well into the expansion. In fact, US short-term interest rates were
below inflation (i.e., real short-term borrowing costs were negative) from late
2001 until early 2006. Even when the Fed did begin raising short-term rates in
mid-2004, long-term nominal interest rates remained roughly flat, and real
long-term interest rates declined.

For all these reasons, a global financial bubble was emerging.
In the middle of 2006, Hank Paulson was confirmed as George W. Bush’s
Treasury Secretary. He came to that job from the position of chairman and
CEO of Goldman Sachs, which gave him an exposure to the markets that
made him generally concerned about the excesses in the financial markets, so
he convened and held regular meetings with the President’s Working Group
on Financial Markets, which was comprised of the top members of the Bush
economic team and key regulators.4 The primary benefit of these meetings
was that they built close working relationships among the members, most
importantly between Paulson, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and New York
Fed President Tim Geithner, and their agencies.
In all financial crises, the personalities, capabilities, and ability to work
well together play crucial roles in influencing the outcomes. In this case,
the most important relationships were between Paulson (an extroverted
former CEO who was used to making bold decisions), Bernanke (an introverted economist who was well-schooled in the Great Depression), and
Geithner (a practical operator experienced in the workings of government
economic policy making). Their complementary qualities, in combination with
their often hourly coordination and their shared willingness to be bold and
quickly evolve policies based on new learnings, were critical to their navigating through this crisis.
While all three men had concerns about the “dry tinder and gathering storm,”
and tried to lean against the excesses that they perceived, the problems
weren’t clear enough to them to prompt them to move quickly or forcefully
enough to prevent what was to come. They noted the excesses in the subprime
market, but none saw these excesses spilling over to the overall housing
market, which had not seen a nationwide decline since World War II. Paulson,
however, was very concerned about the risks posed by Fannie Mae and

110 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

Freddie Mac (known as Government Supported Entities, or GSEs), which
Larry Summers also highlighted when he was Treasury secretary in the
Clinton administration. That prompted Paulson to get President Bush’s
support in the fall of 2006 to begin working on legislation with Barney Frank
(then the ranking minority member of the House Financial Services
Committee) to reform those entities, though that push didn’t lead to progress
until the crisis came to a head in the summer of 2008.5

The Emerging Broader-Based Bubble
The broader economy also showed signs of a bubble. Savings rates declined
from low to lower and the US aggressively sucked in capital from abroad. US
manufacturing employment fell and the US was rapidly losing global export
market share to emerging countries, especially China. However, the increase
in housing-related activity camouflaged this; for instance, construction
employment in support of building houses increasingly financed by debt rose
by around 50 percent compared to 1995.

In addition, a lot of money to fund consumption was also borrowed via
mortgages and other types of debt instruments. High debt growth to fund
consumption rather than investment is a red flag, since consumption
doesn’t produce an income, while investment might.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 111

Typical of such periods, a lot of foreign money came pouring in to participate in the bubble, as reflected in both
capital inflows and our current account deficit swelling (to 6 percent of GDP). A lot of this money was coming
from emerging economies such as China, which were running huge current account surpluses at the time and
were choosing to save/invest in US assets. Strong capital inflows allowed US citizens to borrow so they could
continue consuming more than they were earning.

Many of these flows went to lending that would not produce the income to service the debts. They supported a
dynamic that was unsustainable: The savings rate can’t fall indefinitely, and the wave of lending can’t increase
forever. As the debts came due, there would be cash flow problems. When we ran our pro forma financial
numbers, we could see that when all these flows tapered off, there would be cash flow problems.
During this period, lending increased and became riskier, and it increasingly occurred outside the
regulated and protected banking system. Growth of new ways of lending outside of the normal banking
system—often called the “shadow banking” system—is a common feature of bubble periods. Typically,
financial institutions build new channels that get around the more established and better-regulated
ones because it is initially advantageous to everyone involved. Fewer regulations make it cheaper to
lend, borrowers get lower rates and easier terms, and investors get a small boost to returns. Often,
shadow banks are able to make these new debt assets seem safe to investors via guarantees or through
the way the assets are combined and packaged. Without having been through a crisis to stress-test
them, it can be hard to tell if they really are as safe as they’re made out to be. Often, these “innovations”
lead to the crisis. That was true in this case.
In the early-to-mid-2000s, a number of new channels for increasing leverage popped up, and a number of existing
less-regulated channels became larger. Many of these were short-term in nature and unregulated and thus were
112 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

particularly vulnerable. During the bubble, there were five key components
that helped fuel leveraging outside the traditional banking system:
1)

Use of repo agreements and commercial paper. These developed into
huge channels through which banks and corporations could borrow
over short periods of time. Ben Bernanke notes that “repo liabilities of
US broker dealers increased by a factor of 2.5 in the four years before
the crisis.”6

2) Large institutional depositors outside the protected banking system.
Demand for Treasury securities, especially from foreign investors,
outstripped supply, so there was a shortage of safe assets for investors.
This led to demand for substitutes like asset-backed commercial paper
and repo.
3) Development of money market funds, a short-term savings vehicle
which promised higher returns than bank accounts without much
additional risk.
4) Globalization of dollar lending, leading to the explosion of dollar
borrowing and lending outside of US banks.
5) Securitization of lending, where banks take their traditional loans
(auto loans, home loans, etc.) and sell them to other investors. This
creates a “moral hazard” problem in which banks have an incentive
to make risky loans since they can sell them and not bear the
consequences (as long as investors remain willing to buy).

The US financial regulatory system did not keep pace with these developments. It did not provide adequate regulatory visibility into the shadow banks
and markets, nor did it provide the authorities with the powers they needed to
curb their excesses, though, as is typical, that wasn’t apparent at first. Banks
and shadow banks at the time were inadequately capitalized and over-leveraged. This meant they didn’t have much cushion and would be exposed to
solvency problems in a downturn. In the 1990s and early 2000s era of financial liberalization and financial engineering, regulators were more concerned
about the US financial industry staying competitive with London, which
discouraged them from pulling in the reins.

turned out to be. There would have been less forced selling and a less dangerous margin spiral, as the FDIC’s systemic risk exemption powers to guarantee
liabilities, combined with deposit insurance and the Fed’s discount window,
would have had more power and reach.
So it was not just low interest rates that fueled the bubble, but rather a
combination of easy money, lax regulation, and risky financial innovations. As
the Fed was looking at inflation and not debt growth when setting interest
rates, and as policy makers allowed the lax regulation of shadow lending
channels to continue, the bubble was allowed to grow.
Borrowers and lenders had severe asset/liability mismatches, which left
them especially vulnerable in a downturn. This is a classic ingredient of
a severe debt crisis. Most commonly these mismatches come in the
following forms:
1)

Borrowing short-term and lending long-term, leaving them to
be squeezed when those who lent to them short-term don’t want
to lend to them anymore or only want to lend to them at interest
rates much higher than what they are earning on the loans they
have already made.

2) Lending to risky borrowers who will pay higher interest rates
than they borrowed at in order to collect the credit spread—until
the default rates pick up to a level greater than the credit spread.
3) Borrowing in one currency and lending/investing in another.
When the currency they borrowed in rises, it forces borrowers
to pay back the loan at a higher exchange rate or a higher interest
rate than they can manage.
All these things happened during this bubble, which made these financial
intermediaries and those who trusted them with their money very vulnerable
to runs and credit problems.
One classic asset/liability mismatch that developed occurred via European
banks actively borrowing dollars with short-term debt and then lending them
to the world. When dollar credit tightened in the summer of 2007, these banks
lost access to funding from the US money markets and became transmitters of
contagion around the world.
Still, the economy continued to grow above potential. The GDP gap rose to 3
percent, while inflation rose to 3.7 percent. The Fed continued to tighten to
bring the nominal short rate to 5.25 percent and the real short rate to 1.5
percent in 2007.
By 2007, I was sure that we were in a bubble because it had all the classic signs
previously described, plus when we did cash flow projections for companies and
financial institutions, we suspected that they would not be able to secure the
amount of new lending they needed to allow them to roll over their debts that
were coming due, while at the same time increasing their borrowing to sustain
what they were doing. Without that new lending, there would be a debt crisis.
We regularly reported our thinking and estimates to policy makers, giving them
the choice of believing our numbers so that they could be better prepared, or
correcting our numbers so that we could see where we were wrong. They
typically took the research in without comment but with questions.

Keep in mind that up until this time, hardly anyone was concerned about
hardly anything because both the markets and the economy were doing great.
Stocks were reaching new highs, the job market remained strong, retail sales
were strong, and so was consumer sentiment.
However the housing market and its most aggressive financers began to show
some cracks. As the SEC wrote in a memo on January 4, “[t]here is a broad
recognition that, with the refinancing and real estate booms over, the business
model of many of the smaller subprime originators is no longer viable.”7
Markets were flatter between February and March, and overall market
volatility was pretty low and priced to stay that way. Credit spreads, a
measure of the perception of the risk of lending to private companies, were
relatively low compared to historical norms. In other words, the market was
tranquil and priced to stay that way.

Problems emanating out of subprime mortgage lenders—those that focused on
mortgages for less credit-worthy borrowers—continued to grow, with some
facing considerable losses, but they did not affect the broader economy and
markets. Still, bigger banks were starting to report a rise in bad mortgage debts.
We summarized the situation (in our March 13 Daily Observations) as follows:
(BDO) March 13: Subprime Mortgage Fallout
Subprime mortgages have been grabbing the headlines, with several of the
larger subprime mortgage lenders teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The
story of how the subprime mortgage sector is blowing up even with a
relatively strong economy relates closely to the liquidity that is bubbling up in
markets around the world. Over the last few years, investment banks have
been hard at work creating fancy new products where they can package
up a bunch of assets and sell the package for more than the sum of the
parts (CDOs, CMOs, synthetic CDOs, etc.). They do this by tranching them up
and getting the ratings agencies to rate the best slice AAA, the next slice AA,
and so on. This financial “innovation” makes everyone happy: insurance
companies get an AAA-rated bond that yields a few basis points more than
their other AAA options, and so on down the line. Often hedge funds end up
with the bottom piece, and that makes them happy because they get a lot of
leverage/volatility. This innovation opens up a source of credit to many

risky borrowers (not just households) who previously would have had
trouble accessing credit markets. The explosion in subprime mortgages
is closely related to this new source of credit. Originators paid less and less
attention to underwriting standards because they were just going to hand off
the mortgages to the investment banks. The investment banks were eager to
package them up and sell them to investors. The investors were getting 5bps
more yield for the same credit rating. Lending standards slipped to absurdly
low levels, and then a small up-tick in delinquencies caused the banks to
refuse to buy the loans and the originators to be stuck with the losses.
…The thing that is really hammering the subprime lenders is “early payment
defaults.” The agreements with the investment banks who bought the
subprime loans contained provisions that the lender would have to buy back
the loans if the borrower missed one of the first few payments. Without fraud,
it is very rare for a borrower to miss the first payment on a mortgage. In
December, New Century, the second biggest subprime lender in 2006,
disclosed that borrowers had failed to make the first payment on fully 2.5% of
their loans. When the banks/investors demanded New Century buy back these
loans, New Century couldn’t come up with the cash. Several dozen smaller
subprime lenders have gone bust this way in the last few months, although
New Century is the biggest.
Most people thought that these troubles in one corner of the financial
markets would not cause meaningful contagion elsewhere. On March 28,
Chairman Bernanke said in Congressional testimony that “the impact on the
broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime
market seems likely to be contained.”8 I had a similar assessment at the time,
though I was more concerned about the extent of leverage and tightening
going on in this bubble.
The US stock market continued to rally through April and May, hitting new
records. The shaded portion of the chart shows the rally in the first half of

In mid-June, 10-year Treasury yields hit 5.3 percent (the highest point since
2002), and in mid-July, the 90-day T-bill rate hit 5 percent, meaning the yield
curve was very flat. That was the cyclical peak because of what came next.

116 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

As interest rates rise, so do debt service payments (both on new items
bought on credit, as well as on previously acquired credit that was
financed with variable rate debt). This discourages additional borrowing
(as credit becomes more expensive) and reduces disposable income (as
more money is spent on debt service). Because people borrow less and have
less money left over to spend, spending slows, and since one person’s
spending is another person’s income, incomes drop, and so on and so forth.
When people spend less, prices go down, and economic activity decreases.
Simultaneously, as short-term interest rates rise and the yield curve
flattens or inverts, liquidity declines, and the return on holding short
duration assets (such as cash) increases as their yields rise. As these assets
become relatively more attractive to hold in relation to longer duration
financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), as well as those
assets with lower grade credit ratings (as the spread to these assets
declines), money moves out of financial assets, causing them to fall in
value. Declining asset prices in turn create negative wealth effects, which
feed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes.
The tightening popped the bubble. As interest rates rose, home prices
began to decline, since debt service payments on new homes would be higher,
and interest payments on many existing mortgages rose quickly because many
subprime borrowers had taken out adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). As
interest rates rose, so did their debt service payments. By June, these tightening pressures flowed through to the first broad sign of financial distress:
rising foreclosures and delinquencies started to translate into meaningful
losses for bigger banks. In mid-June, two hedge funds run out of the investment bank Bear Stearns that invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities
(MBS)—one of them leveraged about 20:19—faced growing losses and a wave of
investor redemptions. That required them to do a fire-sale of $3.6 billion of
the securities, a large amount for the market.10 The leveraged financial buying
shifted into deleveraging selling. As the prices of securities they held fell, the
hedge funds faced huge losses and forced liquidations. In the end, Bear
Stearns promised a $3.2 billion loan to bail out one of the funds (later reduced
to $1.6 billion), and other banks that seized collateral from the hedge funds
cooperated to ensure that the market remained stable (e.g., not selling more
subprime MBS). The funds would eventually be wiped out. These were
relatively small funds, and the initial reverberations were limited.

Yields on Treasuries Climb; Shares Tumble Again
“Not long ago, Wall Street trembled when it
looked as if the slowing American economy

Yesterday, that fear again took its toll on
stocks and bonds, giving share prices their
steepest three-day decline since markets
dropped around the world in February, and
the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year

The Summer of 2007
Economic growth remained healthy and US equity markets hit new highs in
mid-July. The most prominent question was whether the Fed’s next move would
be to tighten because of inflation concerns, or ease because of housing concerns.
Stress in the housing market was gradually building. The indices of subprime
MBS (called the ABX indices) continued to see big price declines (even the AAA
bonds, which were likely seen as “riskless” when purchased, fell around 5
percent), and some of the mortgage lenders started reporting increasing
numbers of borrowers missing loan payments. One large mortgage lender
looked to be closer to bankruptcy, and a small German bank exposed to
mortgage loans faced big losses and ended up needing to be acquired by
Germany’s state bank. New home sales were falling very quickly. As this news
emerged, the markets sold off a bit (ending July down 6 percent from the peak).

I expected this debt crisis to be self-reinforcing because of the impact that
mark-to-market accounting and high leverage would have on lenders. Debt
crises and downturns are self-reinforcing behaviors because as losses
occur, both lenders and borrowers are less able to lend and borrow,
which worsens conditions. For example, when losses occur, one’s capital
declines, and because there are limits to how much one can hold in
assets relative to one’s capital, that means assets have to be sold, or the
buying of assets has to be curtailed. That in turn makes asset prices and
lending weaker, producing more losses and reinforcing the cycle
further. Because we could get very detailed financial information on banks
that allowed us to know their exposures, we could estimate what the values
and losses on their positions would be by knowing the pricing of analogous
liquid assets. As a result, we constantly did our mark-to-market stress tests,
which showed us that the financial sector and those dependent on it were
incurring losses before they reported them. We could also get detailed
financial information on public companies and our pro forma financial
projections showed that many were facing debt squeezes.
Here is what I wrote to our clients and policy makers at the time.
(BDO) July 26: Is This the Big One?
You know our view about the crazy lending and leveraging practices going on,
creating a pervasive fragility in the financial system, leading us to believe that
interest rates will rise until there is a cracking of the financial system, at

118 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

which time everything will reverse (i.e. there will be a move to focusing on
fear from focusing on greed, volatilities will increase, and carry and credit
spreads will blow out). We had (and now have) no idea exactly when this will
occur and if what’s happening now is the big one. We just know that 1) we
want to avoid or fade this lunacy and 2) no one knows how this financial
market contagion will play out.
How it will play out is a function of who is carrying what positions and how
these positions and players knock up against each other. A few months ago
we undertook an extensive study to see which market players held what
positions, especially via the derivatives markets. So we read all the
studies by government overseers and financial intermediaries, we gathered
and examined all the data we could obtain, and we delved into 10-K reports of
financial intermediaries. And we concluded that no one has a clue. That is
because one can only vaguely examine these exposures one level deep.
In other words, while it is easy to see some parties’ exposures (particularly
those of regulated financial intermediaries), it is impossible to see who is
carrying these and other positions in order to ascertain the net positions of
the important parties. For example, the dealers who are at the epicenter of
this know who their counterparties are, but they don’t know their counterparties’ total positions. But we do know that these exposures have grown rapidly
(about four times as large as five years ago) and are huge (about $400 trillion).
At the time, growth still looked good as the debt and tightening conditions
hadn’t yet passed through to the economy. On July 31, we wrote: “Tuesday’s
slew of stats continued to convey a picture that the real economy was just fine
heading into the recent market action,” but we were extremely concerned that
the Fed was too sanguine. In its August 7 monetary policy statement, the Fed
said: “Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions
have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing
correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to
expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth
in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.”
In early August 2007, the mortgage market began to seriously unravel. On
August 9, BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank and one of the largest in the
world by assets, froze $2.2 billion worth of investments in three of its funds
because its holdings in US subprime mortgages had exposed it to big losses.
Banks in Europe became more nervous about lending to each other, prompting
the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject 95 billion euros into the banking
system to get rates back to the ECB’s target, and another 61 billion the next
day. The US also saw a squeeze in safe Treasury bills and higher yields on
riskier commercial paper and interbank lending rates. Money market funds,
the main holders of asset-backed commercial paper, saw hits to their asset
values and required assistance from their sponsors, banks, and fund families
in order to avoid “breaking the buck.” (By “breaking the buck” I mean falling
in value below the amount deposited, which is something depositors assumed
would never happen but did.)

Here is what I wrote to clients and policy makers the next day:
(BDO) August 10: This Is the Big One
By that, we mean that this is the financial market unraveling that we’ve been
expecting—the one in which there is an unwinding of widely held, irresponsibly
created positions that occurred as a result of financial middlemen pressing to
invest for high returns the immense amount of liquidity that has been flooding
the financial system—i.e., another 1998 or 1994 (which occurred for the same
reasons), just bigger. I want to reemphasize that what we know about this is less
than what we don’t know because how exactly the cards will fall will depend on
who is holding what positions and how they all knock on with each other.
Despite us doing an awful lot of work to try to get this all mapped out over the
last two years, we couldn’t map this out to an extent that’s worth much because
our knowledge of these positions is so imprecise and the array of possible
permutations is so wide that forecasting where we will be in a couple of weeks
is a bit like predicting how a hurricane will run its course two weeks ahead. We
are also highly confident that others, including the key regulators (who have the
best windows in), can’t give you a forecast that’s much more reliable, so they are
reacting to events. However, having seen this dynamic (i.e., a self-reinforcing
panic move away from high risk investments to low risk investments in which
badly positioned leveraged players get squeezed) many times before (1998 is the
most recent case), we are pretty confident we know some things about how it
will play out. This will run through the system with the speed of a hurricane
(over the next four to six months), and it will leave weaker financial credits dead
or damaged and stronger financial credits in the catbird seat…
…We have a game-plan (developed over many years) that we have confidence
in because we planned for times like this, but for safety’s sake, we are checking that all the hatches are battened down and that the expensive radar we’ve
developed is working well. That game-plan doesn’t just pertain to our investment strategy; it includes our strategy for handling counterparty risks and
transactions costs in an environment of extreme risk-aversion and illiquidity.
What I was referring to as a game plan for this is what we called a
“Depression gauge.” Because big debt crises and depressions had happened
many times before and we had the template explained in this study, we had
created this gauge as a simple algorithm based on the proximity of interest
rates to 0 percent, a few measures of debt vulnerability, and indications of the
beginning of debt deleveraging that would lead us to change our overall
portfolio and risk controls (including our counterparty risks).

120 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

Less than a week later, news emerged that Countrywide, the US’s largest
mortgage issuer, had exhausted its credit line, and was at risk of declaring
bankruptcy. While notable because it was a canary in the coal mine,
Countrywide was not a systemically important financial institution.
Over the next several days, stocks fell sharply and yields on commercial paper
spiked. The Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Fed all responded to the market
stress by providing liquidity to banks. The worst of the stock sell-off ended
when the Fed surprisingly cut interest rates by 0.5 percent—doing so between
its regularly scheduled meetings—an unusual move. Chairman Bernanke said
he would do more if needed.11 And Bank of America shored up Countrywide by
investing $2 billion in exchange for a large stake in the company. These moves
alleviated most of the funding strains in the market, and equities recovered a
bit. Below is a chart of the stock market up until that time. Note that it was
still near its highs.

Coming out of this episode, most policy makers and investors thought that the
problems in the risky part of the mortgage market would be contained, so the
flow-through to the real economy wouldn’t be substantial. Based on our
calculations, we saw it differently and wrote: “the day of reckoning will be
pushed forward, probably to when there is a big tightening by the Fed or a big
turndown in the economy.”
Why Banks and Investors Were So Exposed to Risky Mortgage Securities
Why were investors, banks, rating agencies and policy makers misled into
thinking mortgage securities were less risky than they actually were? A key
reason is the way risk is analyzed. Consider the conventional way investors
think about risk. At the time, Value at Risk (VAR), which is a measure of recent
volatility in markets and portfolios, was commonly used by investment firms
and commercial banks to determine the likely magnitude and occurrence of
losses. It typically uses recent volatility as the main input to how much risk (i.e.,
what size positions) one could comfortably take. As a simplifying illustration,
imagine an investor that never wants to lose more than 20 percent. If the most
that a subprime mortgage has ever lost in a month is 5 percent, then investors
might plug that 5 percent number into a model that then says its “safe” for them
to borrow until they own three times leveraged subprime.
This way of thinking about risk caused many investors to increase their
exposures beyond what would normally be seen as prudent. They looked at

The Bigger Problem
“In our opinion, what is happening here is bigger
than what the world now commonly refers to as
the ‘credit crisis.’ Normally, credit problems
occur when borrowers get into a lot of debt and
cash flows suffer, either because interest rates
rise or the economy falls. But imagine a dynamic
in which the credit keeps flowing and debts keep
increasing. That is the dynamic that’s happening.
It is an extension of having too much credit/
liquidity, not too little.
...The American household sector as a whole is
now in pretty bad shape (i.e., has a bad balance
sheet and poor cash flow outlook), so that
pushing more money into its hands will lead to
worse and worse financial problems pretty
quickly, so we expect that there will be spreading
of credit problems even though interest rates will
decline and credit will be readily available. And
we believe that this will continue until foreign
investors increasingly realize that the US is not a
good place to invest.”

the recent volatility in their VAR calculations, and by and large
expected it to continue moving forward. This is human nature and it
was dumb because past volatility and past correlations aren’t reliable
forecasts of future risks. But it was very profitable. In fact, when we were
cutting back on our positions, our clients urged us to increase them because
our VAR was low. We explained why we didn’t do that. Extrapolating current
conditions forward and imagining that they will be just a slightly different
version of today is to us bad relative to considering the true range of possibilities going forward. If anything, I believe that one should bet on the opposite of
what happened lately, because boring years tend to sow the seeds of future
instability, as well as making the next downturn worse. That’s because low
volatility and benign VAR estimates encourage increased leverage. At
the time, some leverage ratios were nearing 100:1. To me, leverage is a much
better indicator of future volatility than VAR.
In 2007, many banks and investors were heavily exposed to subprime
mortgages, since the instruments had not yet had a loss cycle or experienced
much volatility. VAR was also self-reinforcing on the down side, because
increased market volatility at the peak of the crisis in 2008 made their
statistical riskiness look even higher, causing even more selling.

The Fall of 2007
With stocks on the rebound after the bumpy summer, policy makers started to
consider how they should approach the problems emanating from the
mortgage market over the longer term.
Beginning in the fall of 2006, Paulson and the Treasury had begun working
with Barney Frank and the House Financial Services Committee to reform
Fannie and Freddie. They focused on curbing the excesses and increasing the
authority of the regulator. A bill passed the House in the spring of 2007 but,
stalled in the Senate. Due to significant political opposition, there was no
possibility of getting Federal funding to modify mortgages for struggling
homeowners. So the Bush Treasury worked with lenders, mortgage servicers,
and counselors to motivate these private sector institutions to modify and
restructure mortgages with some modest but meaningful success. Also, the
Treasury began working with the Fed to jointly develop what they dubbed as
the “break the glass” option to go to Congress and get the authority to
purchase illiquid mortgage securities if and when this became politically
feasible. This was the forerunner of what would become the Troubled Asset
Relief Program, or TARP.
The Fed signaled its willingness to ease monetary policy to mitigate any
spillover effects the mortgage-related stress might have on the broader
economy. Although the data and news showed a steady deterioration in
fundamentals, most market participants believed that policy makers would be
able to make it through smoothly.
Bernanke began a push within the Fed (in close collaboration with Hank
Paulson and the Treasury staff) toward what they dubbed “blue-sky thinking”—unrestricted brainstorming in anticipation of the possibility that
conventional policy easing might not be enough.12 As financial contagion
spreads beyond the banking sector, increasing numbers of players in the
real economy can no longer access credit through the usual channels. In

122 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

what would become a crucial pillar of the Fed’s response to the crisis,
Bernanke considered the possibility of the Fed lending directly to a
broader range of counterparties than just depository institutions. This
would be a big, bold move, and so unprecedented that Bernanke had to check
the rulebook to see if it was allowed. The provision of the Federal Reserve Act
that authorized such lending—Section 13(3)—hadn’t been invoked since the
Great Depression, but it was still valid. Knowing which needed actions in a
crisis are permitted (or not permitted) by law and how to have them
approved is a classic challenge in democracies with rigid regulations
and robust checks and balances systems.
Worsening circumstances led to expectations for a rate cut from the Fed. Still,
there were reasons to ease and reasons not to ease. Two considerations
especially weighed against easing. The first concerned inflation: the dollar had
been steadily weakening and oil prices steadily rising. Easing would contribute
to dollar weakness, higher oil prices, and higher inflation. The other consideration was that the problems all stemmed from wrongheaded speculation, and
anything that the Fed did to ameliorate the problems of those speculators
would only encourage them to take excessive risks again in the future.
This notion of “moral hazard” was one that the Fed (and Treasury) would have
to wrestle with many times throughout the crisis. How the “moral hazard”
question is dealt with during big debt crises is one of the biggest determinants of how these crises turn out. Because undisciplined lending and
borrowing was the cause of crisis, it is natural to want to let those who were
responsible experience the consequences of their actions, and to impose lots of
discipline by tightening lending and borrowing. But that’s like putting someone
who just suffered a heart attack because they’re too fat straight on a diet and a
treadmill. At such times, above all else, the most important thing is to
provide life-blood (i.e., stimulants) to keep the systemically important
parts of the system alive. It is dangerous to try to be overly precise in getting
the right balance between (a) letting those who borrowed and lent badly
experience the consequences of their actions and (b) providing judicious
amounts of liquidity/lending to help rectify the severity of the contraction. It is
far better to err on the side of providing too much than to provide too little.
Unlike in the Great Depression, when the Fed allowed banks to fail en masse,
the Fed took the view that although it would be good to minimize moral
hazard when possible, its top priority had to be saving the economy.

Beware Moral Hazard Fundamentalists
“The term ‘moral hazard’ originally comes from
the area of insurance. It refers to the prospect
that insurance will distort behaviour, for example
when holders of fire insurance take less
precautions with respect to avoiding fire or when
holders of health insurance use more healthcare
than they would if they were not insured. In the
financial arena the spectre of moral hazard is
invoked to oppose policies that reduce the
losses of financial institutions that have made
bad decisions. In particular, it is used to caution
against creating an expectation that there will
be future ‘bail-outs.’”

Tim Geithner, who was the president of the New York Fed at the time, shared
my thinking. He believed the moral hazard framework was the wrong way to
think about policy during a financial crisis because policy needs to be very
aggressive in taking out catastrophic risk, and one can’t move slowly or
precisely.13 That has proven true time and time again. Providing plenty of
liquidity during a liquidity crisis leaves the government open to less risk and
leaves the system healthier. In contrast, the moral hazard framework leads
people to believe that if you let things burn, the government will assume less
risk. In reality, if you let everything burn, the government will end up taking
on all of the risk, as it will have to nationalize the system in a much more
costly and damaging way.
In the end, policy makers responded to the crisis by guaranteeing almost
everything, explicitly or implicitly, and carrying out a dramatic, explicit
injection of cash. Geithner told me that the interesting thing about this

approach was that instead of losing 5 to 10 percent of GDP on the cost of the
financial rescue, we actually earned something like 2 percent of GDP, depending on how you measure it. That’s a dramatic outlier in the history of financial
crises, and Geithner credits it to the Fed and Treasury’s very aggressive
response and their willingness to put moral hazard concerns aside. I agree.
On September 18, 2007, the Fed cut rates by 0.5 percent, compared to the 0.25
percent expected by the market. As Bernanke put it, “the hawks and doves
flocked together.”14 The Fed’s bigger-than-expected move sparked a stock
market rally that the New York Times described as “ecstatic,” which brought
the S&P 500 back to within 2 percent of its all-time high.
More important than the stimulation that would come from the Fed’s interest
rate cuts was the message this sent the markets—that the Fed was willing to
take decisive action as needed to help contain the problems that had caused
the market turmoil in August. At the same time, it was clear to those who ran
the numbers that easing wouldn’t solve the more fundamental problems
of financial intermediaries, debtors, and creditors holding more debt
assets and liabilities than could be serviced.
The banks’ (and investment banks’) balance sheet and liquidity problems were
on both the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side, the problems
stemmed from the banks’ ownership of subprime mortgages through securitizations. On the liability side, the banks had become dependent on risky
sources of funding. Banks had always relied on short-term funding, but
historically this had consisted largely of deposits, which could be controlled
with guarantees. Savers can always pull their deposits, and widespread fears
about bank solvency had led them to do just that in the Great Depression. This
led to the founding of the FDIC in 1933, which dealt with this problem by
insuring bank deposits (up to a certain amount). That mostly eliminated the
incentives the depositors had to flee, because even if a bank failed, their
deposits would be protected.
But by relying on what was known as “short-term wholesale funding,” modern
banks had set themselves up for a similar situation to what banks had experienced between 1930 and 1933. Short-term wholesale funding took a variety of
forms, but at its core, it was a lot like an uninsured deposit—meaning the
depositor had a big incentive to pull it from the bank at the first sign of trouble.
Banks and investment banks had also gotten themselves into trouble by virtue
of their central role in what we’ll call the “securitization machine.” At its
heart, the securitization machine started with the issuance of risky
mortgages and ended with the sale of very safe bonds to institutional
investors. Lots of players were involved, but these financial intermediaries
played a major role. Basically a mortgage lender would make the loans and sell
them to a bank, which would package them up into a bundle of say 1,000
loans. The combined cash flows of these 1,000 loans were thought to be much
safer than any individual loan because they benefited from diversification—if
one borrower couldn’t repay their mortgage, that might create a loss on one
loan, but that wouldn’t affect the ability of the other 999 borrowers to repay
their loans. On average, most borrowers had historically been able to repay
their mortgage loans, so the result of the packaging was (supposedly) to
reduce the overall risk profile of the loans.

124 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

The bank would then slice up the total cash flows from the 1,000 loans and
distribute them in chunks: 70 to 80 percent would become a super-safe
AAA-rated bond, another 10 to 15 percent might become a slightly riskier but
still pretty safe AA-rated bond, 5 to 10 percent would become a BBB-rated
bond, and some small unrated residual (the “first-loss” piece) would take the
losses of the first few borrowers that might default. This was a classic case
of data-mining history rather than using sound logic to assess risk.
People were leveraging themselves up by betting that they were safe,
because the thing they were betting against had never happened before.
When the bet went wrong, the self-reinforcing dynamic on the upside shifted
to a self-reinforcing dynamic on the downside.
Banks would sell off whatever bonds they could to investors, typically retaining
the first-loss piece in order to make the deal work. They carried bonds as
inventory (sometimes with the intention of eventually selling them; other times
to hold the exposure for return). This worked, which encouraged them to do it
more until it didn’t work. To varying degrees, the banks were holding large
inventories of these bonds when demand dried up in the third quarter of 2007.
That happened when the write-downs due to mark-to-market accounting
began. Bear Stearns saw its 3Q07 earnings drop by 61 percent due to losses
related to the hedge funds that had blown up and other exposures it had to
subprime mortgages. Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers took 7 percent
and 3 percent hits to earnings, respectively (relatively small losses). Citigroup,
UBS, and Merrill Lynch followed suit, reporting meaningful but manageable
losses. Citigroup initially wrote down the largest loss, at $5.9 billion (keep that
number in mind in comparison to the numbers later in our story).
Around this time (fall 2007) we started running our own loss estimates and
“stress tests” of the financial system—gathering balance sheet data on banks
to see their assets and liabilities, and applying liquid market prices as proxies
to their illiquid holdings to estimate what they would have to report long
before they would have to report it. This was invaluable in anticipating what
was going to happen. On October 9, 2007, the S&P 500 closed at its all-time
high. That high in stocks wouldn’t be reached again until 2013.

China Bank to Buy $1 Billion Stake in Bear

-New York Times

It was clear to most people in the business that banks had a problem with
subprime mortgages, though it wasn’t yet clear to them that the whole
economy had a major debt problem. To help alleviate the situation and build
confidence, a number of major banks proposed joining forces and creating a
fund that would aim to raise $75-100 billion for buying distressed subprime
mortgage securities. Like other observers, we viewed it as a natural response to
the credit crunch that would help to alleviate the risk of contagion. However,
by the end of the year, efforts to establish this fund had been abandoned, as the
collaborating banks decided that it was “not needed at this time.”15
Meanwhile, despite optimism at home, the credit crunch spread from the US
to Europe through two main mechanisms. The first was that some European
banks (most notably the British bank Northern Rock) had come to rely on
money markets for short-term wholesale funding. When that source of
funding began to dry up in the summer of 2007, Northern Rock experienced a
classic “run,” with depositors lining up to withdraw funds for three straight
days in the middle of September.16 The UK had a similar deposit insurance

scheme as the US, but with a lower cap on insured deposits (£35,000). To stem
the run, the British government guaranteed all of Northern Rock’s deposits.
The second mechanism resulted from the investments that many European
banks had made in subprime securitizations. The largest ones, like UBS and
Deutsche Bank, owned stakes in securitizations as a corollary to their role in
producing the securitizations themselves. Many smaller banks had simply
wanted a piece of the action. After all, many slices of subprime securitizations
had been rated AAA, meaning that rating agencies had stamped them as
having extremely low risk. During previous periods of stress, such as the
savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s,
corporate bonds rated AAA had a default rate of 0 percent, according to
Standard & Poor’s, one of the big three rating agencies.17 Plus, the subprime
securitizations rated AAA offered a premium (though in hindsight, one that
was far too small, given the level of risk) relative to corporate bonds of the
same rating.
As our risk measures of the banks, investment banks, and broker dealers that
we dealt with changed, we shifted our exposures from the riskier ones to safer
ones, and also moved into safer assets.
In late October, 2007, sentiment began to turn for the worse as predictions of
the overall losses on subprime securitizations started to increase. US stock
prices suffered a steep 2.6 percent decline on October 19, after JPMorgan
posted a $2 billion write-down and Bank of America announced much
weaker-than-expected earnings.
It was becoming clear that losses on subprime mortgages were going to be a
bigger problem than previously thought for the banks, but it wasn’t yet clear
just how severely the stress in the housing market was going to hit US
households, whose consumption represents the bulk of US GDP (around 70
percent). Here’s what we wrote about it at the time:
(BDO) October 30: Falling Home Prices and Wealth
The weakening housing market affects the US economy in a number of ways
ranging from falling construction, to falling expenditures on housing-related
items, to less cash used from mortgage borrowing on non-housing-related
consumption, to falling wealth. As we have described previously, the drop in
financing alone (money borrowed against houses to spend on other things)
made up over 3% at the peak and will likely be negative soon (and will have to
be made up some other way if consumption growth is to remain where it is)
while the decline in construction at a 20% annual pace is translating to about
a 1% drag on real growth...Real estate assets as % GDP peaked at 167%, so the
drop in wealth will equal about 50% of GDP.

126 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

The impact on households was showing up in a variety of statistics: rising
delinquencies on mortgages, slowing purchases of new and existing homes,
slowing retail sales growth, etc. Policy makers understood that the situation
was about to get worse: the roughly two million of those borrowers with
adjustable-rate mortgages we discussed earlier were scheduled to have their
teaser rates expire in 2008, and thus were about to see their interest costs
jump. Treasury Secretary Paulson announced various measures to help modify
mortgages to extend teaser rates for stressed borrowers, but stopped short of
putting taxpayer money behind the plan, limiting its potential impact.
Meanwhile, at Bridgewater, we completed our first look loss estimates and
stress test by examining the balance sheet data of banks. For us, the exercise
was so eye-opening that on November 21 we released what we called a
“Special Report,” excerpted here:
Bridgewater Special Report:
What We Think Will Be Contained & What We Think Won’t Be Contained
••

Some credit problems have surfaced and some haven’t.

••

We believe that the credit problems that have surfaced (i.e., the subprime/SIV problems) will spread (i.e., there will be a contagion) but
they will be contained (i.e., won’t spread beyond being manageable
and won’t sink the economy, though they will weaken it). That is
because their size is manageable, their ownership is dispersed, and the
demand to acquire these positions from buyers of distressed securities
is relatively large because of the current environment of plentiful
global liquidity. Management of this crisis will of course require
wise decision-making and coordination of central banks, finance
ministries, legislators and financial institutions in much the same
way as management of past financial crises required these. We expect
this wise management and coordinated decision-making, especially
by central banks and finance ministries, because we have relatively
high regard for the people involved and because the actions that are
appropriate are relatively clear.

••

We also “believe” that the credit problems that lie beneath the surface
are much larger and more threatening than the ones that have
surfaced. These latent credit problems are the result of a) there being
an enormous amount of liquidity that is looking to be invested and b)
investors increasingly and imprudently reaching for higher returns via
structured, levered, illiquid, risky investments. Like subprime and other
credit crunch problems before they surfaced, we and others (including
government regulators) do not adequately understand these exposures,
so it is difficult to say for sure where the problems lie or to know how
they will behave individually and in interaction with each other in a
stressful environment. What we do know is that these exposures have
grown exponentially, are very large, and are based on many imprudent,
sometimes seemingly nonsensical strategies. We also believe that if
these problems surface, containing them will be challenging…

Though we do not believe that the “below the surface problems” will

carry trades, increasing volatility and deteriorating counterparties.

When we include all of the credit crunch related exposures that exist
for all entities, we think that the mark-to-market losses as of today are
in the $420 billion range globally, which represents about 1% of global
GDP… we estimate their unrealized losses to be much larger than their
realized losses so we expect much larger write-downs to come.

–New York Times

So we ran the numbers and were extremely concerned by both what we knew
and what we didn’t know. The biggest unknowns, even after we ran the
numbers on potential bank losses (which were enormous), were how these
losses might ripple through the market, especially via the derivative markets.
Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is determined by the value of
some underlying asset, rate, index, or even event. Unlike stocks or bonds, they
are not used to raise money for spending or investment. Instead, they are
primarily instruments for hedging risks and for speculating on changes in
prices. They are made through private contracts rather than on exchanges and
are unregulated. They were also enormous and opaque to everyone, so no one
could get their heads around the exposures that existed—and nobody could
really know how the bank and non-bank lender losses would cascade.
More specifically, in the three decades leading up to the crisis, a huge market
in over-the-counter derivative contracts (i.e., those not traded on regulated
exchanges) developed. In December 2000, Congress clarified that as long as
these over-the-counter contracts (OTC) were between “sophisticated parties,”
they did not have to be regulated as futures or securities—effectively shielding
OTC derivatives from virtually all oversight.18 Over the next seven years, the
OTC market grew quickly. By June 2008, the notional value of these contracts
was $672.6 trillion.
A key derivative that would play a major role in the financial crisis was the
credit default swap (CDS). A CDS plays a role that is similar to insurance.
When an issuer sells a CDS, they promise to insure the buyer against potential
defaults from a particular exposure (such as defaults creating losses from
mortgage-backed securities) in exchange for a regular stream of payments.
CDS’s allow purchasers of mortgage-backed securities (and other assets) to
transfer default risk to the party selling the CDS. AIG, for instance, sold lots of
this “insurance,” but only kept very small reserves against it—meaning they
didn’t have the capacity to pay out if there were large losses.
As noted earlier, I shared my concerns with the Treasury and White House,
but they thought that the picture I was painting was implausible because
nothing like that had happened in their lifetimes. While I am hesitant to speak
about policy makers in general because there are so many differences in what
they are like individually and the different seats they sit in (e.g., in the
Treasury, White House, Congress, SEC, etc.), I must say that they are much
more reactive than proactive, which is understandable because, unlike
investors, they are not in the business of having to bet against the consensus

128 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

and be right, and they operate within political systems that don’t act until
there is a broad consensus that there is an intolerable problem. As a result,
policy makers generally don’t act decisively until a crisis is on top of them.
As 2007 came to an end, the S&P 500 was down 6 percent from its October
peak, but in positive territory for the year as a whole. December’s biggest
market sell-off came on a day that the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25
percent—even though rate cuts ordinarily help stocks—since it was less than
the 0.5 percent cut that the markets were expecting. Bond yields had declined
more sharply, from yields around 5 percent back in June before the credit
crunch began to around 4 percent at the end of the year. The dollar index was
down 8.6 percent over the year. Oil, meanwhile, was up a whopping 55 percent
to $96, just a hair beneath its all-time high.

Depression: 2008
January–February 2008
At the beginning of the year, cracks began to appear in the economy and the
markets. US manufacturing, retail sales, and employment reports were
relatively poor. Then came the inevitable announcements of big write downs
(i.e., losses) at Citigroup ($22.2 billion) and Merrill Lynch ($14.1 billion), as
well as the downgrade of Ambac and MBIA, two bond insurers which had
collectively guaranteed about $1 trillion worth of debt and had big exposure to
subprime mortgage securities. These repeated losses were due to a combination of previous market declines in their holdings and accounting rules
requiring them to be marked to the market and passed through their income
statements and balance sheets. By January 20, the S&P 500 was down about
10 percent. Global equity markets were in even worse shape and fell even
more, as shown in the chart below, left.
Witnessing all this, the Fed realized that it needed to act. Bernanke told the
Federal Open Market Committee that although it wasn’t the Fed’s job to
prevent sharp stock market declines, events seemed to “reflect a growing
belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession.”19
Emphasizing the need for immediate action, he said “we are facing, potentially, a broad crisis. We can no longer temporize. We have to address this…we
have to try to get it under control. If we can’t do that, then we are just going to
lose control of the whole situation.”20
Following an emergency meeting on January 22, the Fed cut rates by 75 basis
points (i.e., 0.75 percent) to 3.5 percent, citing a “weakening of the economic
outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.” A week later, the Fed cut
rates again, this time by 50 basis points, citing “considerable stress” in the
financial sector, “a deepening of the contraction,” and tight credit for
“businesses and households.” The combination of these cuts resulted in the
largest calendar month decline in short rates since 1987. The Senate also
passed a stimulus package (about $160 billion) to boost demand via tax rebates
for low and middle income households.

Stocks bounced, but despite the magnitude of the easing, they failed to recoup
their losses, and by the end of February, stocks were back to where they had
been before the Fed intervened. Credit and economic conditions continued to
deteriorate along the way. Massive write-downs were announced at AIG ($11
billion), UBS ($14 billion), and Credit Suisse ($2.8 billion), indicators of service
sector growth and consumer confidence hit 7- and 16-year lows, and a much
publicized report from UBS estimated that losses from mortgage-backed
securities could total $600 billion in the US financial system.
Reflecting on events at the time, we thought it was important to remind
our clients that this was not going to be a typical recession but rather a
deleveraging/depression-type dynamic, which is quite different in terms
of both its potential magnitude and the linkages that drive the contraction. In
our Bridgewater Daily Observations on January 31, we wrote:
(BDO) January 31: The Really Big Picture; Not Just a Normal Recession
The “R” word has been used a lot to describe the possible contraction in
economic activity because all contractions are now called recessions.
However, to use that term to describe what’s happening would be misleading
in that it connotes an economic contraction like those that occurred in the US
many times before, as distinct from those that occurred in Japan in the 1990s
and in the US in the 1930s, which are better characterized by the “D” word
(e.g., deleveraging).
Contrary to popular belief, a “D” is not simply a more severe version of an
“R”—it is an entirely different process…An “R” is a contraction in real GDP,
brought on by a tight central bank policy (usually to fight inflation) that ends
when the central bank eases. It is relatively well managed via interest rate
changes…A “D” is an economic contraction that results from a financial
deleveraging that leads assets (e.g., stocks and real estate) to be sold, causing
asset prices to decline, causing equity levels to decline, causing more forced
selling of assets, causing a contraction in credit and a contraction in economic
activity, which worsens cash flows and increases asset sales in a self-reinforcing cycle. In other words, the financial deleveraging causes a financial crisis
that causes an economic crisis.

March 2008–Rescuing Bear Stearns
The first ten days of March saw equities sell off about 4.5 percent (with much
larger losses for financials), following high profile defaults at Carlyle Capital
($22 billion in assets under management or AUM), two funds operated by
London-based Peloton Partners ($3 billion AUM), and news that Thornburg
Mortgage ($36 billion in AUM) was missing margin calls. They were all
heavily exposed to mortgage-backed securities and lenders were increasingly
hesitant to lend them money.
These concerns quickly spread to major brokerages, especially those known to
hold significant exposures to MBS, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and
Merrill Lynch, all of which saw their borrowing costs spike. The problems
were passing to systemically important financial institutions, threatening
the entire system. Even so, the danger was not widely appreciated. Writing
on March 10, we noted in our Bridgewater Daily Observations that conditions
were quickly “slipping away” and that “Broker/dealers in our experience cannot
survive with financing costs close to Bear’s current levels.”

Bear Stearns was the most stressed of the major investment banks. Although
Bear was the smallest of them, it still held $400 billion worth of securities
that would be dumped onto the market if it failed. Moreover, Bear and its
nearly 400 subsidiaries had activities that touched almost every other major
financial firm. It had 5,000 trading counterparties and 750,000 open derivatives contracts. As Bernanke put it in his memoirs,21 “size alone wasn’t the
problem. Bear was big, but not that big compared to the largest commercial
banks.” It was not “too big to fail,” it was “too interconnected to fail.”
Bernanke’s greatest fear was that a Bear bankruptcy could trigger a collapse
in the $2.8 trillion tri-party repo market (a significant credit pipe for financial
institutions), an event that would have “disastrous consequences for financial
markets and, as credit froze and asset prices plunged, the entire economy.”
Classically, when a financial institution starts to show early signs of
stress, it can experience “runs” that can accelerate into a failure in a
matter of days, because runs can lead to losing liquidity. That’s because
these institutions rely on short-term borrowing, often overnight borrowing, to
hold longer-term, illiquid assets. At the first sight of trouble, it is logical for
those who are providing this short-term credit to stop lending in order to
avoid losses. We certainly didn’t want to have exposure to a financial institution that was stressed. As more and more market participants change their
behaviors in this way, it creates the liquidity crisis that leads to failure. That
was what was happening to the financial institutions shown in the chart
above to the degrees conveyed by the spreads. The Treasury and the Fed just
had a few days to figure out their responses.
Big financial institutions have failed many times in the past. As I described in
the prior sections of the book, if the debt is in one’s own currency, and if
policy makers have both the knowledge of what it takes to manage it and
the authority to do so, then they are capable of handling these situations
in a way that minimizes spill-over effects and limits economic pain (though some
pain is inevitable). This is a theme we will return to time and time again.
In 2008, the US had a team of policy makers that understood what it would
take to manage a debt crisis about as well as one could expect given that debt
crises of this magnitude happen about once in a lifetime. I want to reemphasize how significant it was that the economic leadership team had the qualities they had. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had more than thirty years of
financial market experience at Goldman Sachs, including eight years as CEO, so

132 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

he brought a good understanding of how financial institutions and markets
worked and a forceful leadership style with experience in making tough
decisions under pressure. Chairman Bernanke was one of the most prominent
economists of the time, and one of the world’s foremost experts on the Great
Depression, which obviously provided critical perspective. Tim Geithner,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (which takes a leading role
in overseeing the biggest banks and implementing monetary policy), had
around two decades of experience in economic policy, including prominent
roles at the Treasury and at the IMF, which gave him exposure to the
handling of financial crises.
Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke told me that they were extremely lucky to be
on a team that trusted one another and had complementary skill sets, and they
all believed that they needed to do whatever they could to prevent the failure
of systemically important institutions. In other words, they agreed on the
important things that had to be done and they were great at cooperating to do
all in their power to get it done. I saw up close how lucky we all were, because
without such cooperation and cleverness, we would have had such a terrible
disaster that it would have taken decades to recover from it.
The biggest problem Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke faced is that they
didn’t have all the legal authority they needed to make some of the moves
that were necessary. For example, by law, the Treasury could only use funds
for purposes designated by Congress. While handling a failing traditional bank
(e.g., one that took retail deposits) had a clear playbook, primarily administered
by the FDIC, there was no authority for the Treasury, the Fed, or any other
regulator to provide capital to a failing investment bank. At this point, to save
an investment bank, there would have to be a willing private sector buyer to
take on the exposure. This limitation proved incredibly consequential.
The urgent need for flexible authority is a classic challenge for policy
makers in the midst of crises. The system that is designed to ensure
stability during normal times is often poorly suited to crisis scenarios
in which immediate, aggressive action is required.
The Treasury and the Fed ran into this challenge with Bear Stearns, so the Fed
turned to the plans it sketched out in late 2007, exercising its section 13(3)
powers—which hadn’t been used since the Great Depression—to arrest what
Bernanke would later call “self-feeding [downward] liquidity dynamics.”22 It
announced a $200 billion new program, the Term Securities Lending Facility
(TSLF), through which it would allow financial institutions, including major
brokerage firms, to borrow cash or treasuries by using risky assets, including
nongovernment mortgage-backed securities, as collateral. Markets applauded the
injection of liquidity, with stocks posting their largest daily gain (about 4 percent)
in over five years.

Despite the announcement of the TSLF, the run on Bear continued. In just
four days (March 10-March 14) Bear Stearns saw an $18 billion cash buffer
disappear as its customers quickly began withdrawing funds. Treasury
Secretary Paulson feared the brokerage could collapse within 24 hours as
soon he heard it was facing such a run on liquidity.23 This was because Bear
had been making loans of up to 60 days while remaining almost completely
reliant on overnight funding. By Thursday, March 14, those fears were
confirmed. Lenders in the repo market refused even to accept Treasury
securities as collateral when making overnight loans to Bear Stearns.

that it is at that point that the equity of the

before the point that the credit problems pass
to others -- and that is taking it right to the
edge (perhaps a bit too far).
While we believe the Fed is acting
appropriately, that does not mean that we are
confident that things will be all right. That’s
because the Fed can’t do it alone (i.e., as you
know, we think we need the accounting

–Associated Press

Bernanke, Geithner, and other Fed officials agreed that another loan from the
Fed wasn’t going to help Bear Stearns. It needed more equity—an investor to
fill the hole created by all the losses. At this point, the Treasury didn’t have
the authority to be that investor. A private sector solution—a healthier
institution to acquire Bear—was the best option. To buy time, the Fed,
along with JP Morgan, promised on March 13 to extend Bear Stearns
“secured funding…as necessary, for an initial period of 28 days.”
JPMorgan, the third largest bank holding company in the country at the time,
was the most natural candidate to buy Bear, because it was Bear’s clearing bank,
served as an intermediary between Bear and its repo lenders, and was thus
considerably more familiar with Bear’s holdings than any other potential suitor.
Only JPMorgan could credibly review Bear’s assets and make a bid before Asian
markets opened on Sunday, a process which importantly included guaranteeing
Bear’s trading book. However, JPMorgan was not willing to proceed if it meant
having to take over Bear’s $35 billion mortgage portfolio. To push a deal through,
the Fed promised to provide JPM with a $30 billion non-recourse loan to buy out
the brokerage (at $2 a share—its peak was $173), secured by Bear’s mortgage
pool, meaning that future losses on the mortgage portfolio would be borne by the
Fed—and ultimately the taxpayer. They also created a new lending facility where
twenty investment banks/brokerages could borrow unlimited sums while
posting MBS for collateral.
On Tuesday, the Fed additionally cut rates 75 basis points (bringing the policy
rate down to 2.25 percent). The rescue and aggressive injection of liquidity had
the desired effect. Stocks rallied and remarkably ended the month flat. Using
taxpayer money to save Bear Stearns would prove a controversial decision, but as
we noted in our Daily Observations at the time, failure to do so would have
resulted in the “financial system…passing the point of no return (i.e., the point at
which the blowing out of risk and liquidity premiums would be
self-reinforcing).”
Although the markets rebounded, Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner worried
because they saw that, without a buyer, they didn’t have the authority to
prevent the bankruptcy of an investment bank in the midst of a panic, and
they immediately began to worry about Lehman.24
Paulson and Bernanke met with House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank and told him that they were concerned about Lehman and
needed emergency authority to wind down a failing investment bank in the
midst of a panic. Frank told them that this would be impossible to get from
Congress unless they made a compelling public case that Lehman was about
to fail and that its failure would damage the US economy. Paulson and
Geithner maintained frequent communication with Lehman’s CEO in an
unsuccessful attempt to convince him to sell the bank or raise equity from a
strategic, cornerstone investor.25
Later in April, Paulson used the Bear failure to convene a meeting with Senators
Chris Dodd and Richard Shelby (the current and former chairmen of the Senate
Banking Committee) and Daniel Mudd and Richard Syron (the CEOs of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac).26 This led to the Senate taking up the GSE reform legislation, which had passed the House in May of 2007 but had stalled in the Senate.

The “expansions of balance sheets” (i.e., the increased lending and
buying of assets) through borrowing was beginning to slow, and, as a
result, economic conditions continued to weaken as reflected in the
economic stats, which came in below expectations. Unemployment
continued to climb, consumer confidence and borrowing continued to fall,
housing delinquencies and foreclosures continued to rise, and manufacturing
and services activity continued to contract. Simultaneously, fresh rounds of
write-downs were announced at UBS ($19 billion), Deutsche Bank ($4 billion),
MBIA ($2.4 billion), and AIG ($7.8 billion). Reflecting on the market action in
the months following the Fed’s rescue, we likened it to a “currency intervention

Simultaneously oil prices continued to climb (hitting $130 in late May) and the
dollar continued to fall. These moves added to the Fed’s dilemma, as it would
have to balance keeping its policy accommodative to ward off an economic
contraction and a further deterioration in financial conditions with concerns
over price stability. The minutes of the Fed’s April meeting reflected this, with
the committee acknowledging “the difficulty of gauging the appropriate stance
of policy in current circumstances.” Two members even expressed “substantial
concerns about the prospects for inflation” and warned that “another reduction in the funds rate…could prove costly over the long run.”
It should be noted that using interest rate and liquidity management
policies that affect the whole economy to deal with the debt problems of
certain sectors is very inefficient at best. Macroprudential policies are
more appropriate (and in fact would’ve been appropriate much earlier, such as
in 2007 when they could’ve been used to control the then-emerging bubbles).
They were not to be put to use until much later, when pressing circumstances
required their use.
Collectively, the combination of new-found optimism in the financial system
and growing concerns over price stability meant that when the Fed cut rates
in late April, markets priced it as the end of the easing cycle.

Summer of 2008: Stagflation
In June the S&P fell by 9 percent because surging oil prices led to a spike in

In terms of credit problems, the month began with downgrades of Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley by Standard & Poor’s, with the
rating agency noting that it had lost some confidence in these banks’ ability to
meet their financial obligations. This was followed by rumors that Lehman
had approached the Fed for emergency funding and a release from Moody’s
that MBIA and Ambac (two of the country’s largest bond insurers) were likely
to lose their AAA ratings (thereby severely impairing their ability to write new
insurance). By the end of the month, Moody’s had cut the insurers’ ratings and
placed Lehman on credit review, while home foreclosures and mortgage
delinquency rates, the underlying drivers of the strains, continued to
accelerate.

As we looked at these institutions’ balance sheets, estimated the losses
they would have to report, and imagined what the reduced capital from
those losses would mean for their lending and sales of assets, it was
clear to us that they were headed for serious trouble that would have
serious knock-on effects. Basically, they were getting margin calls, which
meant that they would have to raise capital or sell assets and contract their
lending, which would be bad for the markets and the economy.

As a result of the contraction in credit, unemployment surged to 5.6 percent
(the largest monthly increase in two decades), manufacturing activity declined
for the fourth month in a row, and consumer confidence hit a 16-year low.
Simultaneously, a CPI print showed that headline inflation rose to 4.4 percent
in May, its sharpest increase in six months, and spiked fears of stagflation
amidst poor growth and rising inflation expectations.
To ease or not to ease—that was the question. The cross-currents made
the answer less than obvious. Throughout the month, policy makers
repeatedly alluded to concerns for both economic growth and price stability.
Bernanke called rising oil prices unwelcome, and Paulson emphasized that
they would be “a real headwind” for the economy. With respect to the
exchange rate, Bernanke emphasized that the Fed would “carefully monitor”
its implications for inflation and inflation expectations, while Paulson even
suggested that he “would never take intervention off the table.”28

The pickup in inflationary pressures prompted a shift of the Fed’s priorities
from preventing debt and economic risks to growth and toward assuring price
stability. As early as June 4, Bernanke noted that further interest-rate cuts
were unlikely due to concerns over inflation, and suggested that the current
policy rate was sufficient to promote moderate growth.29 A few days later
Bernanke gave a speech noting that the rising commodity prices and the
dollar’s depressed value posed a challenge for anchoring long-term inflation.
Finally, on June 25, the Fed left rates unchanged, noting that “although
downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat,
and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased.”
Ugh. See the charts below.

Markets continued to decline, oil prices rose, and a series of ratings
downgrades, write-downs, and poor housing stats surfaced during the first
two weeks of July. Financial stocks went into a free fall as it became clear that
the Fed was behind developments and that the credit problems would not be
fixed up via a blanket easy Fed policy even if it aggressively eased. The
mortgage crisis and who it would affect next also became clearer. Shares of
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae came under extreme selling pressure, following
a report by Lehman Brothers, published on July 7, stating that the two
mortgage giants would need a capital infusion of as much as $75 billion to
remain solvent. According to Paulson, the report “set off an investor
stampede,” with shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae declining by about 45
percent each respectively in the week following the report’s release.30
In mid-July, markets bounced because oil prices declined sharply (leaving
more room for the Fed to ease) and policy makers made a series of interventions to shore up confidence in the financial sector—most importantly with
respect to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Also, the SEC placed restrictions on
shorting 19 financial stocks (including the two mortgage lenders), the Fed
extended its emergency lending program for investment banks and brokerages, and the Treasury and the Fed announced a plan under which Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae would be able to tap into public funding (i.e., be bailed
out) if on the verge of collapse.

Taking Control of Fannie and Freddie
Of all the interventions, the guarantee to use public funds to support Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac was the most unprecedented. Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac were two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), created by Congress
in 1938 and 1970 respectively, with the former being part of Roosevelt’s New
Deal following the Great Depression. They were created to stabilize the US
mortgage market and promote affordable housing. They did this primarily by
buying mortgages from approved private lenders, packaging many together,
guaranteeing timely payment on them, and then selling them back to investors.
At first glance, everyone looked to benefit from this arrangement.
Private lenders had a ready buyer for about as many mortgages as they could
originate. Fannie and Freddie profited greatly from buying riskier mortgages
and turning them into a safe asset (i.e., buying something cheap and selling it
for more). Banks and other investors were happy to have a greater supply of
safe assets to invest in, earning slightly more than they would on equivalent
treasury bonds. And households benefited from cheaper borrowing rates.
Of course, all this was based on an implicit guarantee that the government
would backstop Fannie and Freddie—it was only that guarantee that allowed
the securities issued by GSEs to be seen as about as safe as treasuries, giving
them very low borrowing rates. At times, the spread on their debt to treasuries essentially hit 0 percent.

Markets are tightening while the economy is
deteriorating and financials are in free-fall
“In the past three months since the Bear
Stearns rescue a set of economic and market
conditions have transpired that are inherently
unsustainable and self-defeating. While the
tax refunds and a few other unsustainable
sources of money have stabilized spending and
the economy, market prices that directly
impact the economy have responded in a way
that is uniformly restrictive. At the same time,
the bounce in financial stocks that originally
conveyed a more positive tone to the financial
landscape has largely disappeared. Instead,
deteriorating credit conditions in the real
economy are feeding back onto the financial
system, leaving behind a very big pile of
financial institutions whose stock prices are in
free-fall and whose market value of leverage is
exploding. This high market value of leverage
(assets divided by market cap) implies that on
the margin, ever smaller declines in the value
of their assets will wipe out ever larger chunks
of equity value, the classic over-leveraged
death spiral. Bigger losses lie ahead and the
banking industry does not have enough
healthy entities to absorb the dying ones. And,
the sovereign wealth funds have lost their
appetite for large doses of bank equity. The
inadequacy of bank capital combined with the
coming need to liquidate ever-larger portfolios
of bank assets will further constrain credit
growth in the economy. In the meantime,
market prices are acting as a restrictive force
against growth at the same time that the
financial sector is collapsing.”

“All markets are trading as one, with a recent

marked by a $17 drop in oil prices, limits on
shorting financials when short interest was at a
record, and a few positive earnings surprises
from the banks. Of course this action can’t last
because the forces that drive these markets are
widely varied and often conflicting, but such
action is common when sentiment gets to
extremes….Meanwhile, there has been no
reversal in the underlying economic conditions
as reflected in the economic stats through July.
They have continued to weaken.”

While they weren’t officially guaranteed by law, and government officials had
denied for years that there was any guarantee, the private market believed that
the government would never let the GSEs fail, as it would hurt too many,
including individual homeowners—though they couldn’t be 100 percent sure
because the Treasury wouldn’t make that assurance. I remember a dinner
meeting I had with the head of a Chinese organization that held a massive
amount of bonds issued by the GSEs, in which she expressed her concerns. I
especially admired how the Chinese creditors approached this situation
analytically and with a high level of consideration. Ironically the larger the
GSEs grew, the more “systemically important” they became, which in turn all
but guaranteed a government rescue if needed, making them safer and further
fueling their growth.
Although Fannie and Freddie were supposed to generate revenue primarily
through insuring mortgage debt, by 2007 about two-thirds of their profits
came from holding risky mortgage-backed securities. The problems associated
with having these exposures were made worse by lax regulation. Congress only
required Freddie and Fannie to keep 0.45 percent of their off-balance-sheet
obligations and 2.5 percent of their portfolio assets in reserves, meaning that
they were significantly undercapitalized, even when compared with commercial
banks of equivalent size, which were also severely undercapitalized (meaning
that it only took a modest loss to make them go broke). Paulson saw this and
openly called them “disasters waiting to happen…extreme examples of a broader
problem…too much leverage and lax regulation.”31
By 2007, these two mortgage insurers were twenty times larger than Bear
Stearns and either owned, or had guaranteed, $5 trillion dollars in residential
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities—about half of what had been
issued in the US. Financing such operations also made them one of the largest
issuers of debt in the world, with $1.7 trillion outstanding, about 20 percent of
which was held by international investors. They were also huge players in the
short-term lending market, frequently borrowing up to $20 billion a week. It
didn’t take a sharp pencil to see that they were a disaster waiting to happen.
The only question was what the government would do.
Doing something to rein them in would be politically challenging. Larry
Summers recently described to me the challenges he faced when dealing with
them in the 1990s:
“Fannie and Freddie had vast political power. When we said anything
raising any concern about them, they had arranged for the Treasury to
receive 40,000 pieces of mail saying it is important that Fannie and
Freddie be fully enabled to do their vital work. When we testified on
Fannie and Freddie, a congressman would pull out an envelope from
Fannie with their prepared statements and what their questions were
going to be. They would have a set of mayors call if you tried to mess
with them. The most disillusioning experience I had with respect to the
financial community was at the quarterly dinner for the Treasury
Advisory Borrowing Committee. I asked them: ‘What do you guys think
about the GSEs?’ They said that the GSEs were like a massively
over-leveraged hedge fund—dangerous. They were pretty emphatic. I
said, ‘Would you put that in your report?’ and they said they would. The
report came back basically saying that Fannie and Freddie are vital

140 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

contributors to our financial systems. I asked what happened. They said
that they checked with their bosses and their bosses said we couldn’t say
that because we all had such important client relationships.”
Paulson described this situation as follows:
“We had seen what happened in March when Bear Stearns’s counterparties…abruptly turned away. We had survived that, but the collapse of
Fannie and Freddie would be catastrophic. Seemingly everyone in the
world—little banks, big banks, foreign central banks, money market
funds—[either] owned their paper or were [their] counterparty. Investors
would lose tens of billions; foreigners would lose confidence in the US. It
might cause a run on the dollar.”32

This case exemplifies the very common problem of politics creating government guarantees (implicit or explicit) that make risky assets appear to
be safer than they are. This encourages investors to lever up in them,
which feeds bad debt growth.
As losses from mortgage-backed securities mounted, shares of Freddie and
Fannie plummeted because everyone knew they had a lot of bad debt. Equity
holders knew they would get hit even if the creditors were protected. By July
15, Freddie and Fannie’s equity prices had declined by almost 75 percent in
less than a year.
Now that the crisis was at hand and undeniably obvious, it had to be dealt with.
After frantic behind the scenes negotiations, the Treasury was able to get a bill
passed by Congress on July 23 allowing it to use a virtually unlimited (Paulson
chose the term “unspecified”) amount of dollars to provide funds to the two
GSEs (limited only by the overall federal debt ceiling), and expanded regulatory
oversight of them. The Treasury basically acquired a blank check, backstopped
by the taxpayer, to do whatever it took to keep these institutions solvent.

Nationalizing too-big-to-fail financial institutions on the brink of
failure is a classic move in a deleveraging that is usually well received, as it
signifies that the government is willing to provide a blanket of safety over the
system. Remember that when debts are denominated in a country’s own
currency, the government has the power to eliminate the risks of default.

Though there are undeniable advantages to a political environment in
which there are checks and balances and laws,* during times of crisis
there exists the risk that what needs to be done might not be done swiftly
enough. That’s because laws are never written so perfectly that they can
anticipate and specify how to handle every possible circumstance.
Throughout the 2008 financial crisis, there were numerous close calls in which
the parties involved did the things that needed to be done, even if that required
them to get around the rules to do them.
On July 30, as soon as Congress granted the Treasury the authority to oversee
Fannie and Freddie, regulators from the Treasury began working to assess
just how dire the situation was. With the help of the Fed and outside accounting specialists, Treasury officials pored over the GSEs’ books. They soon
discovered that both Fannie and Freddie had been papering over massive
capital losses. Once they had properly accounted for questionably valued
intangible assets and improperly valued mortgage guarantees, they saw that
both companies were at least tens of billions of dollars underwater. As Paulson
later put it, “We’d been prepared for bad news, but the extent of the problems
was startling.”33
From mid-August until the bailout, the situation was analyzed; terms were
finalized on September 7. The Treasury then raced to build a plan that would
serve its economic goals without bumping up against legal constraints. In the
end, it decided to put the GSEs into conservatorship while injecting capital
through guaranteed purchases of preferred stock. Conservatorship would
allow both Fannie and Freddie to keep running relatively normally following
the takeover, while the guaranteed stock purchases would allow the Treasury
to effectively backstop their debt, even after the 18-month limit on its authority expired. And, importantly, Paulson wouldn’t have to give Fannie and
Freddie any heads up—all it would take was a go-ahead from their direct
regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
Bailing out the GSEs was more of a political challenge than an economic one.
The executives of both companies still believed they were on sound footing.
After all, just a couple of weeks before the FHFA had sent the GSEs drafts of
reports concluding they were sufficiently capitalized. If news of the planned
takeover leaked, the executives of Fannie and Freddie would have time to
mobilize their lobbyists and congressional allies in Washington to fight it.
And if there were a fight, there was no guarantee that the Treasury would
win—in Paulson’s words, the GSEs were famously the “toughest streetfighters
in town.”34
Convincing the FHFA examiners required the coordination and combined
influence of the Treasury, the Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC. The FHFA, which
had repeatedly blessed Fannie and Freddie’s books on the basis of loose
statutory accounting rules, was embarrassed at the thought of reversing itself
so suddenly. But after weeks of pressure from the Treasury and its allies, the
FHFA examiners gave in on September 4. The next day, the news was given to
the boards of the two companies. Fearing that any friction or delay in the
takeover might send markets plunging, Paulson set out, in his own words, “to
ambush Freddie and Fannie” with no advance warning.35

142 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

Paulson described the Fannie-Freddie situation to me as follows. In July 2008, when Fannie and Freddie were
beginning to fail, the Treasury asked for very expansive emergency powers. As Freddie and Fannie combined
were nine times larger than Lehman Brothers and the dominant sources of mortgage financing during the crisis,
they could not be allowed to fail. However, Paulson’s political people had told him that if they put a big dollar
number in front of Congress for approval, Congress would likely get spooked. As Paulson couldn’t ask for
unlimited authority to inject capital into the two GSEs, he decided to ask for “unspecified” authority.
However, when the Treasury finally got the “unspecified” authority, it was temporary, i.e., it expired in October
2009. This presented a challenge, because Fannie and Freddie had long-term debt and insured long term
mortgages. So it took some creative financial engineering to turn this expansive authority, which Congress had
intended to be only temporary, into what was for all intents and purposes a long-term guarantee. To do this,
policy makers used their ability to immediately issue long-term preferred stock. Then they used these preferred
shares to backstop Fannie and Freddie and absorb any potential losses.
This particular move—with its legal finagling—and the need to convince numerous lawmakers to set aside their
ideological opposition to bailouts for financial institutions, while at the same time getting Congress to raise the
debt ceiling sufficiently to allow for a potentially meaningful capital injection, were unprecedented and remarkable. But as Paulson described it later, “if Congress failed to come through, markets would implode. The stakes
were enormous.”36
In early August, falling oil prices and the Treasury’s unprecedented intervention helped usher in an interval of
relief, with equities rallying modestly through August (about 2 percent), financials down only 1 percent, and the
free fall of Freddie and Fannie stock halted. However, despite the growing perception that financial markets
were stabilizing, the underlying drivers of credit problems, and their feedback mechanisms into the real
economy, had not changed.
On August 18, I reminded the readers of our Daily Observations that the worst was yet to come.
(BDO) August 18: Entering the Second Stage of the Deleveraging
It seems to me that we have been through much of the first stage and are now entering the second stage (i.e., the
avalanche stage) of the deleveraging. While the Fed did a great job of providing liquidity where it reasonably
could, the accounting adjustments (e.g., allowing losses to be written down over several years) weren’t made, so
we are approaching a solvency crisis that we think is about to result in an avalanche of asset sales. So now
the question is whether they will create a safety net in time to catch these assets so that they don’t crash and
bring down the financial system and the economy with it. Frankly, we think that this will be a race to the wire.

Over the first week of September, there was a mix of good and bad news in
the form of oil prices falling precipitously (which reduced concern over
inflation and provided a tailwind to US consumer spending). Airlines and
retailers, hopeful of a pickup in consumer spending, were particular beneficiaries. At the same time, falling oil prices reflected weakening global growth.

While financial players like Lehman Brothers, Freddie, Fannie, and Ambac

the works. For example, Lehman’s stock rose on news that it had made
progress in negotiations to sell part of itself to the Korea Development Bank,
while good news from Freddie (a successful sale of $4 billion in debt) and
Ambac (the announced launch of a new insurance subsidiary) partially
softened investor concerns surrounding these companies.

Lehman Goes Bankrupt: September 8–15
Stocks rose about two percent on Monday, September 8, as the market
responded positively to news of the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie, a
bold move that would have been unthinkable months before. The New York
Times wrote that “financial stocks led the surge, propelled by hope that the
government’s decision had averted a calamity and marked a possible turning
point in the credit crisis that has troubled banks for nearly a year” (my emphasis). Boy, was that wrong.
Writers of accounts such as this one, who have the benefit of hindsight,
typically paint pictures of what happened in ways that make what happened
seem obvious. However, as that rally and comment reflect, it is an entirely
different matter when one is in the moment. Just days before the crisis would
become much worse, the New York Times wrote on three separate occasions
(September 3, 5, and 10) about “bargain hunters” coming in with the stock
market down around 20 percent from peak and many individual stocks down
much more. Lehman Brothers, for instance, was trading down some 80
percent, but it was a company with a good reputation, a nearly 160-year
history, and it looked to be on the verge of finding a buyer or strategic investor. Below is its share price through early September. While the picture is
clearly within the downtrend, there were rallies, and in just about all of them,
one could make the argument that the bottom was being made. In investing,
it’s at least as important to know when not to be confident and when not to
make a bet as it is to have an opinion and make one.

The strategic investor who would come in and save Lehman never materialized and Lehman’s stock fell by almost 50 percent on Tuesday. Other major
bank stocks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill, sold off 5–10
percent, while the overall market was down about 3 percent, and credit
spreads widened substantially. Both investors and regulators began to wonder
whether Lehman could survive until the weekend.

There were no clear, legally acceptable paths for saving failing investment
banks, yet these investment banks were “systemically important” (i.e., they
could easily take the whole system down with them). While the Fed was able
to lend to Lehman to alleviate its liquidity problem, there were limitations on
how much they should under these conditions. And since Lehman faced a
solvency problem in addition to a liquidity problem, it wasn’t even clear that
more liquidity could save it.
As we described earlier, a solvency problem can only be dealt with by
providing more equity capital (or changing the accounting/regulatory
rules). This meant that some entity needed to invest in it or acquire it. Neither
the Fed nor the Treasury had the authority to provide that. Hence, there was a
need to find a private sector investor/buyer, like Bear Stearns had with
JPMorgan. But finding an investor for Lehman was harder than it was for
Bear. Lehman was bigger, with a bigger, more complicated, and murkier mess
of losing positions.
Finding a buyer was made even harder by the fact that Lehman wasn’t the
only investment bank needing a buyer to survive. Merrill Lynch, another
iconic Wall Street investment bank, was in a similarly dire situation. As with
Lehman, many believed that without an investor Merrill was no more than a
week away from bankruptcy.37
On Thursday Lehman’s shares continued their free fall, declining another 42
percent as rumors swirled that Barclays and Bank of America, though interested, were unwilling to buy without government assistance. At this point,
Lehman was continually rolling $200 billion in overnight loans just to stay
running, putting it at huge risk of a pullback in credit.38
On Friday Lehman’s shares dropped 17 percent on news that neither the Fed
nor the Treasury would backstop any deal. Lehman’s failure would pass
through the system quickly, causing a domino effect that took a toll on AIG
(its stock fell 31 percent). But, remarkably, most of the market still believed
that the financial sector’s problems would be contained. The overall market
closed on Friday up 0.4 percent, aided by falling oil prices.

On Friday evening, reports surfaced that Fed officials had gathered the heads of Wall Street’s major banks—from
Goldman Sachs to the Bank of New York Mellon—to urge them to bail out Lehman. Whether there would be any
takers remained to be seen. Bank of America, Barclays, and HSBC had reportedly expressed interest, but none
wanted to do the deal without government support. And Treasury officials publicly insisted no support would come.
Paulson had hoped that by motivating a consortium of financial institutions to take on Lehman’s bad loans, a
potential acquisition of Lehman could be facilitated (as a potential buyer could leave a substantial portion of
Lehman’s bad assets behind when they acquired the firm). But while some progress was made with the consortium, no potential buyer emerged. Without a potential buyer, the Fed did not have any authorities which would
have been effective in preventing the failure of a nonbank in the midst of a panic-driven run, according to
Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner.39
Bernanke and Geithner had many conversations together and with Paulson about what they could do to help
prevent Lehman’s failure, but, as in the case of Bear Stearns, they did not believe that a Fed loan would be
effective. They believed that the legal requirement that a loan had to be “secured to their satisfaction” limited the
amount they could lend, and that meant they could not lend Lehman enough to save it or guarantee its trading
book. The weeks before that fateful weekend were consumed by the effort to figure out a way to prevent
Lehman’s failure despite those constraints. They were willing to be very creative with their authority and to take
a lot of risk, but only within the bounds of what the law allowed. They erred on the side of doing more, not less,
but Section 13(3) (the section of the Federal Reserve Act that allowed for emergency lending to a wider set of
borrowers) did not make them alchemists. Loans were not equity, and they had to be guided by what would work
in practice.
Most everyone agrees that it would have been a lot better if these policy makers had the authority to liquidate
Lehman in an orderly way; this was another classic example of how political constraints together with imperfectly thought-out legal constraints can get in the way of actions that are widely agreed to be beneficial.
On Sunday afternoon the news broke that Lehman was headed for bankruptcy, and all hell broke loose. The
shock was way bigger than any before because of Lehman’s size and interconnectedness to other vulnerable
institutions, which made it clear that the contagion would spread. Even worse, the government’s failure to save it
raised doubts about whether it could save the system. Lehman’s failure was particularly scary because of its
large and poorly understood interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system.
There were a couple of major channels of potential contagion. The most important (and least clear) was Lehman’s
substantial presence in derivatives markets. At the time of its bankruptcy, Lehman was a party to between $4
and $6 trillion worth of exposure in CDS, accounting for about 8 percent of the total market. Though many of
these exposures were offsetting—Lehman did not actually owe huge sums on net—its failure sent clients

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 147

scrambling to find new counterparties. At the time, no one knew how large Lehman’s net exposure was, or who
was on the other side of it; we were crossing the line into a big, disastrous unknown. On September 11, we wrote
in the Daily Observations:
The uncertainty of this situation is tremendous. What happens when you go to settle a currency forward transaction with a counterparty that suddenly doesn’t exist? Maybe everything goes fine, but maybe some unexpected
condition bites you in the ass. What if you haven’t been collecting mark-to-market gains from one of your dealers
(we collect constantly from everyone), they go down, and now you are a general creditor? Who do you transfer
the risk to? Maybe Merrill is right behind Lehman. What do you about that? And who might be behind it? If
everyone is asking these questions the natural path is to cut back on trading and concentrate positions with a few
firms. But these few firms have the incentive to ration their capacity to the highest quality financial institutions
and managers. The inevitable result is substantially lower liquidity, higher transactions cost, and higher volatility.
Higher volatility then feeds back into the real economy because people and businesses transact at these prices.
And capital constraints in the financial sector mean that credit growth remains low, which undermines
economic growth. We are getting very close to crossing this line.
While Lehman’s bankruptcy was the largest in US history (and still is), with some $600 billion in reported assets,
it was only about two-thirds the size of Goldman Sachs, and a quarter as large as JPMorgan. They were all
connected and the losses and liquidity problems were spreading fast.
We called this stage of the crisis the “avalanche”—the point at which a smaller problem in one corner of
the financial system (subprime mortgages) was building in self-reinforcing ways into much bigger
problems, and fast.

Aftermath of the Lehman Collapse: September 15–18
On Monday morning, September 15, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the stock market fell by nearly 5
percent. No industry was spared, though the financial sector took the brunt of the pain, with shares of banks and
insurers falling by about 10 percent. Credit spreads blew out and credit flow ground to a halt. Over the course of
the following week, markets, policy makers, and we at Bridgewater struggled to figure out the ripple effects from
Lehman, which of course we couldn’t because the interrelationships and exposures were too complex and too
opaque. It was clear to us that blanket protections would have to be put into place, because the consequences of the uncertainties themselves would be devastating as everyone ran from any entity that
could go under. But if policy makers couldn’t or wouldn’t save Lehman Brothers, how could they save
the system?
One of the Fed’s immediate responses, announced the night before, was an unprecedented expansion in the
“Primary Dealer Credit Facility”: They were willing to lend to investment banks against almost any collateral,
including extremely risky instruments—e.g., equities, subprime mortgages, and junk bonds. It should have been
seen as an enormous step for a central bank to take, and in a more normal environment, it would have been. But
the Lehman collapse overshadowed it.

Paulson would later write in his book that he felt constrained from even
being able to explain in a forthright way why Lehman had failed
without creating more problems—a common issue policy makers face
when communicating during a crisis. As he put it:
“I was in a painful bind that I all too frequently found myself in as a
public official. Although it’s my nature to be forthright, it was important
to convey a sense of resolution and confidence to calm the markets and
to help Americans make sense of things…I did not want to suggest that
we were powerless. I could not say, for example, that we did not have
the statutory authority to save Lehman—even though it was true. Say
that and it would be the end of Morgan Stanley, which was in far
superior financial shape to Lehman but was already under an assault
that would dramatically intensify in the coming days. Lose Morgan
Stanley, and Goldman Sachs would be next in line—if they fell, the
financial system might vaporize and with it, the economy.”40
With big questions on the direction policy was heading, I wrote the following
note to our clients on September 15:
(BDO) September 15: Where We Are Now
We have known about the losses that had to be taken by financial institutions
for some time. They were discussed and conveyed to you in the tables that we
sent to you repeatedly, over the last year. So, these problems were known. We
described them as ‘known and manageable’ because, besides being known, we
felt that they were manageable via sensible government policies—of providing
liquidity (by the Fed), changing accounting rules and/or creating a safety net
(by the Treasury, in cooperation with Congress)—and then clearly articulating
these policies to provide the necessary confidence that would allow the debt
restructuring process to progress in an orderly manner…
While we are still trying to figure out what the Treasury and Fed’s approaches
are, over the last few days they made some more things clear by innuendo.
They made clear that they’re willing to take the chance of diving into the
depths of the scary unknown without a clear safety net in place. So, now we
sit and wait to see if they have some hidden trick up their sleeves or if
they really are as reckless as they seem. With interest rates heading
toward 0 percent, financial intermediaries broken and the deleveraging well
under way, it appears that we are headed into a new domain in which the
classic monetary tools won’t work and the Japan in the 1990s and US in
the 1930’s dynamic will drive things.

Financial Crisis Enters New Phase
“The financial crisis entered a potentially

–New York Times

Meanwhile, reports came in showing how the financial meltdown was passing
to the economy, leading it to plummet. A Fed report showed industrial output
down sharply in August; AIG saw its credit ratings downgraded, potentially
triggering additional collateral requirements; and Hewlett Packard announced it
was cutting 25,000 jobs. With America’s financial system obviously in crisis, the
problems quickly spread globally, prompting European and Asian central banks
to announce new liquidity provision measures to shore up their own markets.
Credit markets were in turmoil. As financial players sorted through the tangle
of counterparty risks and obligations created by Lehman’s failure, interbank
lending seized up and Libor (the rate at which banks lend to each other)
settled at almost twice the prior week’s levels. The contagion was spreading to
everyone, even the strongest. Privately, executives from blue-chip firms like
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 149

GE admitted to regulators that even they were having trouble borrowing in the commercial paper market, which
could put them in a cash-flow bind and force them to default. Prime money market funds started to register
increasing stress, high redemptions, and losses (we’ll discuss this in more detail a little later). By the end of the
day, credit spreads on Morgan Stanley widened to levels greater than those for Lehman on Friday.
Throughout the day, regulators scrambled to keep up with AIG’s rapid decline. AIG was one of the largest
insurers, with around $1 trillion in assets at peak. Its problems centered around it having issued hundreds of
billions of dollars of insurance contracts on bonds (called CDS and CDOs), which required it to pay out if a bond
faced losses. Many of these insured bonds were repackaged subprime mortgages, so AIG was exposed to a
staggering amount of losses. Since many other financial institutions were counting on these insurance contracts,
AIG was systemically important. And it looked to be heading toward failure fast. On Sunday, it had said it would
need $40 billion in funding. Now, just a day later, it was suggesting it would need $85 billion.41

On Tuesday, the Fed made two surprising policy moves—one far bolder than expected, the other more timid. On
the one hand, the Fed, in a regularly scheduled meeting to set interest rates, decided not to change them, when the
market expected them to be lowered—a significant disappointment that hurt the markets. Remarkably, even as the
market looked to be on the verge of a depression, the Fed remained concerned about inflation, putting in their
statement, “The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the
Committee.” In his memoir, Bernanke would later write that “in retrospect, that decision was certainly a mistake,”
caused in part by “substantial sentiment at the meeting in favor of holding our fire until we had a better sense of
how the Lehman situation would play out.”42
However, more importantly, the Fed also made an announcement that redefined the limits of US central banking.
It courageously announced that it would provide $85 billion in emergency funding to AIG. The deal, drafted in a
rush on the afternoon of Tuesday, September 16, came with tough terms attached. AIG would pay a floating
interest rate starting at 11.5 percent, while giving the government an 80 percent ownership stake in the company.
Because AIG did not have enough safe financial assets to secure the loan, it pledged nearly everything else it
owned as collateral—including its insurance subsidiaries, financial services companies, and various real estate
holdings (including a ski resort!). The Fed loan worked because the market believed AIG was solvent (because of
the value of its insurance subsidiaries, which had investment-grade credit ratings). The fact that these served as
collateral for the Fed’s loan was also critical to the Fed’s decision.43
But even under these terms, the loan was an unusually risky one for the Fed—after all, the companies AIG put up
as collateral were not nearly as easy to value or to sell as the AAA securities the Fed accepted in normal times.
And there was still a risk that AIG would go under, despite the Fed’s help. Geithner would later say, “Deciding to
support AIG was one of the most difficult choices I have ever been involved in in over 20 years of public service.”44
News of AIG’s bailout did not lift markets on Wednesday. Instead, stocks slid by about 4.7 percent, with shares of
major financial institutions down by double digits. Rates on commercial paper continued to rise, while yields on
three-month treasury bills fell to just above 0 percent (down from around 1.6 percent a week before) as investors

fled to safety. Through this chaos, regulators announced a series of stabilizing measures. The SEC moved to
tighten controls over short sellers (a common crisis response), and bank regulators proposed revisions to accounting rules to help dress up bank balance sheets.
Let’s spend a minute on the importance of accounting, especially mark-to-market accounting. For banks, some
assets are “marked-to-market,” which means that every day banks take a look at what they could sell those assets
for, and value them at those prices. Other assets are allowed to be valued in different ways, often by an in-house
methodology that depends on the asset. When an asset that banks are required to mark-to-market is selling at
fire-sale prices, any bank holding it looks like they are taking significant losses, which reduces their capital and
thus requires them to raise money or sell assets, which further strains liquidity and puts further downward
pressure on assets. It also scares the hell out of people dealing with them. Accounting changes that allow banks
to realize losses over a longer time period (i.e., not marking assets to market) prevents some of these problems. Of
course, changing accounting rules to hide losses during a financial crisis doesn’t engender confidence either, so
regulators have to be careful.
But accounting changes wouldn’t change the more fundamental issue—that overindebted US households and
financial institutions were defaulting on their debts because they were overlevered. It was clear that financial
institutions needed to be recapitalized (e.g., via an equity investment), and they needed to find buyers for their
more troubled assets. So Paulson turned to Congress for funding and authorization for the Treasury department
to play that role.

The Government Comes Up with a Bailout Fund: September 18–31
Paulson, Bernanke, and congressional leaders (most importantly, Barney Frank) thought the best way to restore
confidence was to buy troubled assets through what would become the Troubled Asset Relief Program. They could
have pursued nationalizing the banks, but there was no precedent for it in the US, and when banks were nationalized in other countries, they were penalized with harsh terms. For that reason, banks were reluctant to accept
capital and nationalization until just before or immediately after they failed. Paulson did not believe this was the
way to go, because it would be more damaging than helpful to the task of reviving capital flows.
Buying assets seemed sensible because a big source of the banks’ problems were the large amounts of complex,
highly illiquid mortgage securities on their balance sheets. The theory was that if the government provided some
market for them, prices would rise, capital would be freed up, and confidence would be restored, allowing the
banking system to begin to recapitalize.
When Wall Street learned about the possible TARP plan on Thursday, the market rose. The rally continued on
Friday, with stocks up 4 percent, as more of the details emerged. President Bush and Secretary Paulson
announced that the federal government was prepared to spend $500 billion to buy up troubled mortgages, while
congressional leaders promised to act quickly to pass any proposal. Then the Fed unveiled $180 billion in new
swap lines for global central banks, somewhat easing fears of a dollar liquidity crunch in foreign markets. The
SEC instituted a ban on the short-selling of nearly 800 financial stocks. And Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley came under the government’s legal authority to provide a blanket of protection by voluntarily becoming
bank holding companies, giving them greater access to the Fed’s lending channels.
The Treasury also unveiled a creative new move to shore up troubled money market funds, which held
$3.5 trillion. Money market funds had become very popular as an alternative to bank deposits for both retail
and institutional investors. Most investors were attracted by their high interest rates and undeterred by their lack
of FDIC protection; they didn’t appreciate that they were delivering those higher interest rates by investing in
higher-yielding and higher-risk loans. They also believed that they would not lose money in them as their
principal was protected.
Prime money-market funds had been a crucial source of liquidity for all kinds of businesses, since they buy commercial paper, a type of short-term debt that businesses use to fund their operations. Because the commercial paper
they hold is generally diversified and highly rated, these funds are usually considered almost riskless—like CDs or
bank deposits. But a few prime funds took losses when Lehman failed, specifically the Reserve Primary Fund,
Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 151

which “broke the buck” on September 16. Fears that others might take losses caused many investors to pull their
money. As the dollars flowed out of these funds, they had to liquidate their holdings of commercial paper. The result
was that hundreds of billions of dollars that had been funding the day-to-day operations of businesses dried up in a
matter of days.

After the Reserve Fund broke the buck, Ken Wilson, who was at Treasury at the time, had gotten a call at 7 a.m.
from Northern Trust, followed by others from Black Rock, State Street, and Bank of New York Mellon. All of
them reported runs on their money-market funds. Meanwhile, GE had been in the news, explaining that they
couldn’t sell their paper. Then Coca-Cola CFO Muhtar Kent called and said they were going to be unable to make
their $800 million quarterly dividend payment at the end of the week because they couldn’t roll their paper. Even
AAA-rated industrial- and consumer-products companies couldn’t roll their paper! The situation was very
quickly metastasizing from Wall Street to Main Street.
To stop the run on money-market funds, Paulson decided to guarantee them outright. The only problem was that
the funds would need a substantial backstop and the Treasury couldn’t immediately find the cash. To get around
the problem, Treasury officials turned to a creative source—tapping the $50 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund
(ESF) to back up its guarantee. This plan was announced Friday, September 19, four days after the Lehman
collapse. Treasury Secretaries can get into big trouble if they spend money that hasn’t been appropriated. So
Paulson got his general counsel to give him an opinion that he could use that $45 billion, since if the whole
economy went down it wouldn’t be good for the dollar.45 Some of Paulson’s colleagues questioned whether $45
billion would be enough, given that there were $3.5 trillion worth of money-market funds. Paulson didn’t know if
it would be, but he didn’t have a better idea.
The Treasury team was moving so fast that Sheila Bair (the head of the FDIC) called and complained that not
only was she not consulted, but because of the guarantee all of the money would now go from bank deposits to
Money-Market Funds. That was a good point. So the Treasury clarified that the guarantee was only applicable to
money-market funds that were in trouble as of September 19. The guarantee worked incredibly well and markets
immediately turned. According to Paulson, this was because when you say something is a guarantee and not just
a backstop, it is much more reassuring to investors.
The ESF was meant to be used to defend the dollar against runs, but its mandate was flexible enough that the fund
could be diverted to more pressing uses. And it could be done quickly, with only presidential approval. This was
exactly the kind of quick thinking and creativity that was required to navigate the regulatory and political
minefield and get what was needed done.
The coordinated and comprehensive policy shifts were a relief to investors. Our Daily Observations from the day
speaks for itself:

152 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

(BDO) September 18: Great Moves!
The Treasury, Fed, and Congress finally agreed to agree to build the safety net!!!!
Overnight central banks added $180 billion in liquidity!
Regulators moved against short sellers.
Morgan Stanley was frozen and is about to be dealt with, and Goldman isn’t far
behind, but moves are in the works to deal with them.
The week’s optimism faded, however, as further details of TARP emerged (or,
rather, failed to emerge) over the weekend. The formal proposal put forward
by the Bush administration on Saturday, September 20, was three pages long,
and was intended to be an outline rather than a fait accompli to Congress. The
proposal, to be called TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program), called for $700
billion in purchases of mortgage-related assets, but offered few details on how
these purchases would be administered or what other actions might be
taken—and that amount of money was a pittance in comparison to the need.
As we explained to our clients when the bill was first unveiled, troubled asset
purchases couldn’t have much impact on their own:
(BDO) September 25: The Proposed Plan Disappoints:
Buying up $700 billion in mortgages (along with some other assets) will hardly
help us at all. If these mortgages are bought at market prices it won’t change the
financial conditions of nearly anyone materially, the mortgages will be a small
percentage of the amount that needs to be bought, and the action won’t deal
with most of the problems that exist. If they are bought at a premium, this will
be both an unethical direct subsidy that is on the wrong side of the line, and it
will mean that the amount of money spent will buy less and it still won’t contain
the problems.
To make matters worse, legislators were put off by the unchecked authority
the bill would give the Treasury, so getting it through Congress wasn’t
assured. When markets opened on Monday, stocks sold off, closing down 3.8
percent and the dollar fell against most major currencies.
The evolving story of the TARP bill’s difficult journey through Washington
DC—set against a backdrop of poor economic releases and icy credit markets—
drove the ups and downs throughout the week of September 22. Most importantly, political struggles between those who wanted to provide the support
and those who didn’t drove the markets Monday through Wednesday. As
Bernanke and Paulson urged immediate action in testimony before Congress
on Tuesday, President Bush addressed the nation in support of TARP on
Wednesday. Yet little apparent progress came out of Congress. Legislative
momentum was interrupted by debates over the need for a more comprehensive bill with more significant aid for homeowners and better-defined limits
on the authority of the Treasury. Compensation for executives at banks
became a hot-button issue. Many other issues that had some politicians
anti- and others pro- led to lots of arguing and little progress.

bear the costs is typical during deleveragings and highly counterproductive;
it can be like doctors in the emergency ward arguing over who will pay the
bill. All attention needs to be directed to saving the patient—how the costs
should be handled can be decided later.
Even proposing the TARP bill was risky. If it didn’t pass, there was likely to be
an extremely negative market reaction. And they needed it passed in very
difficult circumstances: as soon as possible, weeks before a presidential
election and amid a populist uproar from both the left and the right over its
unprecedented size and scope. Given the vote counts in Congress, the bill
would need to pass on a bipartisan basis, which by this point was extremely
rare on any new important law (and has become even rarer since). If either of
the presidential candidates opposed the bill, it would have been nearly
impossible to get passed—McCain and Palin initially taking an anti-bailout
position put the bill at risk, though they eventually supported it. (Paulson was
on the phone almost daily with both presidential candidates.) The only factor
working in the bill’s favor was that it usually takes a crisis to get Congress to
act, and the financial crisis was in its most acute stage. The difficulties in
getting TARP passed are a good illustration of why regulators need broad
emergency authorities versus needing to rely on Congress to act.
Financial markets pulsated in response to each undulation between “they will”
and “they won’t” do what was necessary in time. Credit spreads on CDS for
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had narrowed following their
transformations into bank holding companies over the weekend, widened
through the week, and huge outflows from prime money-market funds and into
government funds continued to put pressure on commercial paper. On Thursday
night, the FDIC seized control of Washington Mutual, marking the largest bank
failure in American history, before shifting its assets to JPMorgan in a $1.9
billion deal (they would seize Wachovia a few days later). As we wrote on
Friday, September 26, “There is so much jam packed into each day that it is hard
to pick what to comment on. The big picture through which we see all the daily
news is that we are in the avalanche phase of the deleveraging.”
The political stalemate in Congress seemed to break early Sunday morning, as
Secretary Paulson, flanked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid, announced that an agreement had been reached
on a $700 billion bailout bill.
But when the bill came up for a vote on Monday afternoon, it failed. Stocks fell
8.8 percent in the largest single-day drop since 1987. Around the world, reverberations sent markets spiraling downward; oil prices fell by $10 because in a
depression the demand for it would be much less. Central banks, meanwhile,
scrambled to offer emergency loans to shell-shocked institutions. Interbank
lending markets froze, while rates on short-term treasuries fell to just above zero.

Again, among the most important aspects of successfully managing a crisis is having wise and knowledgeable decision-makers who have the authority to do whatever it takes. The Congressional vote was a sign that
the Treasury would have to struggle to get the authority it needed. At the time, we wrote:
(BDO) September 29: A Credibility Test
The financing of US consumption and the global financial system operates on faith. Recent developments have
obviously strained the faith in the financial system. Today’s failure in the House of the bill, whose passage was
assured by those supposedly in control, has shined the global spotlight on US decision makers. The question of
whether the US can do what needs to get done has been further complicated. In the end, the world’s financiers
(China, OPEC) will decide whether US policy makers have passed the test.
Even had the bailout passed, maintaining the necessary global faith in the system would have been difficult.
Today the degree of difficulty has risen and the risk of a loss of faith has increased given the chaotic process and
lack of leadership illustrated in Washington. There is still a lot to lose.
Officials at the Treasury and Congressional leaders were working around the clock to get the bailout bill passed.
The process was painful: Convincing Republicans and Democrats to work together is hard enough during a
normal year, but TARP was being considered only a month before a hotly contested presidential election.
Republicans hated to look as though they were abandoning their free-market principles and their commitment to
fiscal responsibility just to support a bank bailout. Democrats worried about giving a major legislative win to an
outgoing Republican administration just before an election. And both Obama and McCain worried that the other
would try to bolster his populist credentials by taking a stand against a so-called “Wall Street bailout.” If that
happened, Paulson worried, the bill would have little chance of passing.46
But politics wasn’t the only headache associated with TARP. While the Treasury had been working with
Congress to get TARP passed, two of the biggest bank failures in US history occurred (WaMu and Wachovia),
and several European countries had to step up and bail out their own banks. Treasury officials could see that
$700 billion in purchases of toxic assets wouldn’t be enough to rescue markets. But if the money was put directly
into the banks as capital, they could buy many times the $700 billion because they could lever up.
Even though they said they weren’t going to put capital in the banks through TARP, they pushed to get authority
to do it if necessary. The question would be how to do it fast and well. Rather than try to distinguish between
healthy and unhealthy banks, an analytical nightmare, which would have prompted a lot of arguing and would
have taken more time than they had while stigmatizing the banks they supported (which could have worsened
the runs), the Treasury instead offered to buy preferred stocks on very attractive terms. This allowed it to put
capital into 700 banks very quickly.
What Paulson did was enormously unpopular because, understandably, the public wanted to punish the banks. In
my opinion, the move was necessary and appropriate. It also worked out very well for the taxpayer, because the
money that went into TARP’s capital programs prevented a catastrophic collapse, which would have been as bad
or worse than the Great Depression—not to mention that it all came back plus an almost $50 billion profit for the

taxpayers. This willingness to do the unpopular but right things to benefit
people is both heroic and underappreciated. Too many people who have never
actually been on the field throw beer cans from the stands. This can lead to
disastrous results, unless the players are smart enough and courageous
enough to do what is right despite the unpopularity of doing it.
With a lot of negotiating, TARP eventually got through, which was an
extraordinary accomplishment because it was a very rare, consequential
bipartisan action from Congress. As you can imagine, everyone was on pins
and needles because of the enormity of the uncertainties. As with most such
cases, it took being at the edge of the precipice to bring about the coordinated
action to do the right thing. While it would be great if policy makers could
take the right steps early on to prevent such crises, that’s unfortunately not
consistent with how political systems work. From having been through a
bunch of these sorts of dramas in many countries over many years, I can attest
that political systems typically make the right decisions only after heated
fighting and literally just hours before disaster is about to strike.
But by the time the bill passed on October 3, there was broad agreement
among investors that the bill wouldn’t be enough. Stocks sold off 1.4 percent.

October 2008
For policy makers, the first days of October were a scramble to get as much
done in as short a time as possible. With the economy deteriorating daily,
nearly every regulatory department had a major policy change in the works,
each with its own roadblocks, tradeoffs, and benefits.
At the FDIC, regulators worked on raising the ceiling on deposit coverage. The
FDIC’s analysts knew they needed to provide more coverage—Depressionstyle bank runs on Wachovia had made that clear—but they also worried that
raising the limit too high would draw depositors from foreign banks with
lower limits, choking off liquidity in Europe and Asia. So they settled on a
compromise measure—raising the limit from $100,000 to $250,000 on
October 3 as part of the same bill that authorized TARP—hoping it would be
enough to ease pressure on struggling banks but not so much that it would
start a deposit-insurance war with foreign regulators. The FDIC later followed
up with the Transaction Account Guarantee Program that fully guaranteed
non-interest bearing transaction accounts at participating banks.
Every day, a new wave of bad news hammered stocks. The economy was
sinking fast. In the first week of October alone, PMI (a survey of purchasing
managers) came in well below expectations, data on factory orders showed a 4
percent decline in August, and a payroll report showed a loss of 159,000 jobs
in September—marking the worst month in five years. The following week,
similarly grim economic stats came out in retail sales (down 7.7 percent year
over year).

latitude in buying commercial paper and other
short-term assets that help finance business
operations. But on Thursday, both institutional
and retail prime funds collected fresh assets.”
–New York Times

This acute pain wasn’t concentrated only in the financial sector. Reports
surfaced that major nonfinancial corporations were relying on credit lines to
finance continuing operations as they found themselves all but shut out of
corporate paper markets. Some companies announced that they were slashing
dividends to keep up cash reserves, and outflows from prime money-market
funds continued. In the household sector, a report showed that consumer
credit had fallen in August for the first time since 1998. Similar stories were
unfolding globally, as liquidity dried up in every major market, even as central
banks announced unprecedented interventions.
In the face of so much pain, policy makers rolled out ever-larger initiatives
to thaw frozen credit markets and ease concerns throughout the financial
system. On October 7, for instance, the Fed announced an extraordinary new
plan to purchase unsecured commercial paper. Since bank lending had been
almost completely choked off and money-market funds had pulled hundreds of
billions of dollars out of commercial paper markets, major nonfinancial companies were struggling just to continue funding normal operations. Fearing major

White House Overhauling Rescue Plan
“As international leaders gathered here on
Saturday to grapple with the global financial
crisis, the Bush administration embarked on an
overhaul of its own strategy for rescuing the
foundering financial system. Two weeks after
persuading Congress to let it spend $700 billion
to buy distressed securities tied to mortgages,
the Bush administration has put that idea aside
in favor of a new approach that would have the
government inject capital directly into the
nation’s banks—in effect, partially nationalizing
the industry.”

would buy up commercial paper using loans provided by the Fed under its
Section 13(3) powers. In practice, the Fed was agreeing to finance commercial
paper purchases directly, with no backstop against losses by the Treasury. The
move took the Fed to the edge of its statutory authority or perhaps a bit
beyond (depending on who you ask), as the central bank is generally not
permitted to take on much exposure with such risky credit. The Fed bravely
did what it needed to do and hoped that the fees the CPFF charged borrowers
could be used to cover any losses, though covering losses was appropriately
not the primary objective.
Just days after the passage of TARP, Paulson began hinting that the funds
might be used to capitalize the banks instead of just purchasing troubled
assets, as he said he had been anticipating for weeks.47 On October 9, at
Paulson’s urging, White House officials started to signal that TARP money
might go to capital injections into banks.
There was so much to do, and policy-making needed to proceed at a furious
pace. It was an utterly insane week.
The single largest push on the part of policy makers came over Columbus Day
Weekend: October 11–13. On Saturday, October 11, President Bush met with
members of the G7 in Washington to publicly commit himself to a coordinated
international effort to contain what had become a global financial crisis. It
was agreed that the members of the G7 would move together to inject capital
into their banking institutions and increase deposit insurance guarantees.
Over the next two days, officials from the Treasury raced to finalize America’s
part of the international commitment. The centerpieces of the new program
were two bold new policy changes—a huge expansion of FDIC insurance
coverage, and a massive injection of capital into the banking system.
Typically, the FDIC is only responsible for insuring the deposits of commercial
banks. Under the new Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, however, the
FDIC’s authority had been stretched to guarantee the debt of any single systemically important bank and to backstop losses on all newly issued unsecured debt
by banks and bank-holding companies as well as all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This amounted to a guarantee of nearly all bank debt. It was an
extraordinary measure that many feared might have serious unintended
consequences, but, as Paulson would later write, “To be frank, I hated these
options, but I didn’t want to preside over a meltdown.”48
Under the new Capital Purchase Program, the Treasury planned to use its
TARP money to take equity stakes in as many banking institutions as possible,
up to a limit of 3 percent of risk-weighted assets or $250 billion. As explained
earlier, the investments would come in the form of preferred stock with a 5
percent dividend.
Paulson needed even the healthiest banks to participate, because if only the
weak ones did, participation would create a stigma that could encourage runs.
And so, though the Treasury had no power to force banks to take capital, it
did what it could. On Monday, October 13, Paulson invited the CEOs of nine
major banks to his private conference room, and explained that he expected
everyone in attendance to participate, and even prescribed the amount of
capital he expected each bank to take. None left without taking government
money. By the end of the meeting, Paulson had pledged $125 billion of the
$700 billion Congress had given him.

158 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

But even with the cash injection, markets in the US, Europe, and Japan continued to worsen. So it became clear to Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner that they
had to act with even greater force. Bernanke and Paulson had very consequential meetings with central bankers and the finance ministers in the G7 to
coordinate an international response. Paulson and President Bush also met with
G20 finance ministers. Meanwhile, there were teams moving very fast at the
Treasury working to develop the US response. Several people took Paulson aside
and warned him that they were perhaps moving too fast, and that doing so
could be dangerous. However, Paulson believed that if policy makers did not
move quickly, they would have nothing that would work when all the markets
opened on Tuesday after the three-day Columbus Day weekend.49
Paulson says that the most powerful step they took was the Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program, in which the FDIC used its funds, which were
established to protect savers, to guarantee the liabilities of financial institutions,
including the unsecured liabilities of bank holding companies.50 At one point,
the FDIC’s general counsel said this was illegal. However, Paulson and others
spent a lot of time convincing its head, Sheila Bair, that this was the right thing
to do, and she ultimately made the very courageous decision to back it—which
made a huge difference.51
As news of the programs leaked on Monday, October 13 (and policy makers
around the world announced similar projects), the markets that were open
surged. Stocks rallied by 11.6 percent, the largest single-day increase in the
S&P 500 since 1939.
It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider how significant these announcements were in the larger story of the crisis. Up to this point, most of the
government responses had come in the form of ad hoc reactions to individual
disasters. The Fed had borne a disproportionately large share of the burden,
and it was not at all clear that other agencies would adequately support it. But
now it seemed increasingly clear that policy makers in the US and around the
world were committed to taking extraordinary, coordinated action. Still, huge
uncertainties lay ahead, as the underlying economy continued to deteriorate.
Here’s how we described this moment to our clients at the time:
(BDO) October 13: The Governments Are Doing Everything Possible;
Now We Will Have to See If It’s In Time
These are great moves. They are doing everything that we had hoped that
they would do. While these would have worked in stage one of the crisis—e.g.,
if they did them instead of allowing Lehman to go bankrupt—the crisis has
spread to a stage 3 condition, so we just have to wait and see. The big question
is whether the massive liquidity injections and bank recapitalizations will get
to those who are at the periphery of the system.
Many dominos are now falling that are beyond the reach of government. We
know of lots of them that are big and scary and we are sure that we don’t
know of many others. So, it is hard to know for sure how these big problems
will be affected by these policy changes and what the effects of these big
credit/liquidity problems will be…

The Fed Continues to Try to Get the Dollars
Where They Are Needed
“The Fed continues to push unprecedented
liquidity into the system across a variety of
channels. The unprecedented push of liquidity
has more than doubled the Fed’s balance sheet
by increasing their assets and liabilities by
nearly a trillion dollars, but it has still not offset
the private sector need. The world has
accumulated so many dollar debts, and the
ability to roll and grow these debts was so
ingrained in the financial system’s architecture,
that the breakdown requires the unprecedented
push from the Fed. Nonetheless, the risks the
Fed faces in embarking on this course are
numerous, and so much of the global financial
system lays out of the Fed’s reach.”

Fears and uncertainties surrounding the economy kept volatility extremely high
over the next week. On Wednesday, for instance, stocks fell 9 percent following
grim retail sales numbers for September and a warning from Bernanke that any
“broader economic recovery” would be slow to arrive.52 The following day, the
market rebounded by 4.3 percent, even in the face of a number of disappointing
stat releases, and rates on commercial paper fell slightly.
But by Monday, October 20, markets had registered a meaningful easing of
conditions in interbank lending and commercial paper. Rates on commercial
paper touched four-week lows, while short-term treasury yields crept up. This
thawing of credit conditions helped lift stocks, and represented a significant
easing of the pressure on banks.

Still, most of the financial mismatches that were squeezing financial institutions
and companies (i.e., borrowing short term and lending longer term, borrowing in
one currency and lending in another) had yet to be resolved. There was a squeeze
for dollars because foreign financial institutions that had borrowed dollars and
lent them out now had to pay them back, and/or had to deal with their debtors,
who had to pay them back in dollars when dollars, money, and credit were hard
to come by. Though the Fed continually expanded its dollar swap lines (i.e.,
liquidity lending) with developed-world central banks throughout October, it was
not able to provide enough dollar liquidity to alleviate this global dollar squeeze.
Part of the problem lay in central banks’ reluctance to lend Fed-provided dollars
against locally denominated collateral because of their fears of default and
logistical issues. The largest squeeze occurred in emerging markets, where major
dollar debts had built up and debtors were scrambling for dollars. All in all, the
dollar rallied 8 percent in October.

Here’s how we explained the situation to our clients at the time:
(BDO) October 22: The Dollar Squeeze
A debt is a short cash position—i.e., a commitment to deliver cash that one
doesn’t have. Because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and because of
the dollar surplus recycling that has taken place over the past few years…lots of
dollar denominated debt has been built up around the world. So, as dollar
liquidity has become tight, there has been a dollar squeeze. This squeeze…is
hitting dollar-indebted emerging markets (particularly those of commodity
exporters) and is supporting the dollar. When this short squeeze ends, which
will happen when either the debtors default or get the liquidity to prevent their
default, the US dollar will decline. Until then, we expect to remain long the
USD against the euro and emerging market currencies.
The actual price of anything is always equal to the amount of spending on the
item being exchanged divided by the quantity of the item being sold (i.e., P =
$/Q), so a) knowing who is spending and who is selling what quantity (and
ideally why) is the ideal way to get at the price at any time, and b) prices don’t
always react to changes in fundamentals as they happen in the ways characterized by those who seek to explain price movements in connection with
unfolding news. During this period, volatility remained extremely high for
reasons that had nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with
who was getting in and out of positions for various reasons—like being
squeezed, no longer being squeezed, rebalancing portfolios, etc. For example,
on Tuesday, October 28, the S&P gained more than 10 percent and the next day
it fell by 1.1 percent when the Fed cut interest rates by another 50 basis points.
Closing the month, the S&P was down 17 percent—the largest single-month
drop since October 1987.

November–December 2008
In the midst of this chaos, on November 4, Barack Obama was elected
President amid record turnout, and would come into office with big majorities
in both houses of Congress. Heading into the election, Obama had promised
billions in government spending on infrastructure, unemployment insurance,
and Medicaid, and was supportive of TARP—and control of Congress would
allow him to move quickly.

privately-funded credit expansion going
because it is uneconomic for creditors to lend,
especially when they are squeezed. Without a
credit expansion, the deleveraging/depression
will continue until ultimately there will be a
global debt restructuring (i.e., diminishing the
size of creditors’ claims on debtors).”

We Are Thrilled with the Fed’s Management and
Are Hopeful That There Will Be Excellent
Management at the Treasury
“While the Fed sowed the seeds of this crisis by
allowing credit growth to be fast enough to
cause rapid deteriorations in Americans’
balance sheets (at first under Greenspan and
then under Bernanke), and the Treasury allowed
the deleveraging crisis to move beyond that
which was manageable, the Fed behaved
superbly once the deleveraging crisis became
apparent to it, thereby mitigating the implosion
in credit. It has quietly, imaginatively and
aggressively redefined the optimal way that
central banks should behave in depressions by
essentially replacing, rather than relying on,
impaired financial institutions to provide credit
to key entities.”

While the financial contagion may have been slowed by the Treasury and the
Fed’s actions so far, it became clearer in the last couple months of 2008
that the economy was falling at a far faster pace than even the most
pessimistic observers feared, and that we were heading for the worst
downturn since the Great Depression and into the great unknown.
To us the economy was now in the classic early days of a deleveraging/
depression, when monetary policy could not work normally. Interest rates
could no longer be lowered and innumerable avenues of credit had dried up.
Most of the important economic stats released in November were worse than the
already very poor expectations. Consumer spending fell at an extraordinary rate;
retail sales fell by over 8 percent and auto sales were down 30 percent year over
year. Businesses across industries reacted to poor results with historic layoffs.
The unemployment rate moved up past 6.8 percent, the highest level since 1994,
and projections for layoffs and unemployment increased dramatically. December
saw the worst manufacturing reading since 1982. The economy was imploding.

Businesses across industries looked to the federal government for aid to shore up
their finances. The auto industry in particular remained in dire straits and
actively sought backstops from the federal government. However, the Treasury
department was reluctant to broaden the $700 billion TARP package to include
industrial companies and was thus unwilling to assist major automakers. In early
November, the Treasury turned down a request by General Motors for $10 billion
to help finance a possible merger with Chrysler. Without funding from the
federal government and with credit markets remaining nonfunctional, automakers turned to selling assets to raise cash. Both Ford and General Motors sold
their stakes in other automakers during the month.
162 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

On November 10, AIG reported a $25 billion quarterly loss (while securing an
additional $150 billion from the government to curtail financial contagion).
Fannie Mae posted a $29 billion loss and said it might need more than the
$100 billion the Treasury had already pledged to keep it afloat.
Paulson hadn’t said anything publicly about how his thinking was changing, as
he hadn’t wanted to influence the election.53 The market was expecting a
significant asset repurchase program. However, in a mid-November postelection
speech, Paulson announced his plans for modifying Treasury’s use of TARP.
He disclosed that Treasury no longer planned to buy illiquid assets because
the market for these securities was frozen. Funds would instead be channeled
to banks and nonbank financial companies (though not auto companies) as
equity-like capital to better free them up to resume normal lending.
Additionally, a new lending program was announced that was targeted at
consumer lending markets. This new program allowed the Treasury to put up
part of the funding for auto loans, credit cards, and student loans. The
markets, however, reacted negatively to the adjustment. Paulson noted after
the fact: “As I feared, the markets focused on the fact that there wouldn’t be a
program to purchase mortgage-related assets.”54 This rattled the markets and
the S&P dropped 5.2 percent.
Stocks reached a new low on November 20, down over 20 percent for the
month (and 52 percent from their highs). Oil collapsed (now below $50 a
barrel), and home prices continued to fall. However, this new low was met
with a relatively quick reversal on news that Obama would nominate Timothy
Geithner to be Treasury secretary and Larry Summers (former Treasury
secretary) to be director of the National Economic Council, as both were
justifiably considered highly capable. Summers came into this job having been
concerned about the possibility of a major debt crisis for a while (in a speech
in early March before Bear’s collapse, he had said, “I believe that we are
facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses
that the United States has faced in a generation—and possibly much longer
than that,”55 and he was an advocate of big policy moves in response to the
crisis. He would end up as a key decision-maker in the administration’s policy
toward auto companies. Bernanke would of course stay at the Fed, so there
was good continuity among the leaders of the economic team. These moves
helped assure policy continuity between administrations.
On November 25, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury announced $800
billion in lending and asset purchases aimed at pushing down mortgage rates
(to help the housing market). The central bank committed to purchases of
$600 billion in debt tied to home loans. This was their first Quantitative
Easing (QE) program. This was a classic and critical step in managing a
deleveraging. Central bankers in the midst of crises are forced to choose
between 1) “printing” more money (beyond what’s needed for bank liquidity)
to replace the decline in private credit, and 2) allowing a big tightening as
credit collapses. They inevitably choose to print, as they did in this case,
which is when things changed dramatically.
I hope you will read the next section, about the US debt crisis in the
1928–37 period (as well as look at the other cases) to see how true this is.
What was different in 2008 was the speed with which the policy makers
made this crucial step. The 1930–33 depression went on so long because
policy makers were so slow to react—not because their problems were

The Balance Sheet Problem
“The thaw in credit markets since the Fed
decided to inject equity into banks has been
insufficient in preventing the avalanche of credit
market selling. The freeze that continues in
credit markets is evidenced by the breakdown
of basic financing relationships in markets that
were taken for granted as arbitrages when
financing was available. The economy will be in
free fall until new credit is available at rates that
make sense given economic conditions, and
new credit is unlikely to be made available at
such rates while there are so many dislocations
to take advantage of first. Today, there is just
no willingness to use up balance sheet (create
credit) for even arbitrages, much less the
financing of new economic activity.”

(BDO) November 25: Why We Expect More Shock & Awe And What It
Will Mean
Though we can’t speak for them, we believe that the Fed and the new
Treasury folks understand the deleveraging/depression dynamic and the
seriousness of the one that we’re in. In fact, we believe that their understanding is now quite similar ours, so they are doing what we would do, and that
they will probably do about what we would do. Along these lines, we expect
shock and awe type moves from both the Fed and the Administration (i.e., the
Treasury and other departments).
Today’s Fed’s announced moves are just the latest steps down the path of continuing to broaden the securities bought and increase the amounts spent to bring
down credit spreads and add liquidity to the system. We expect more because we
expect that they will do “whatever it takes” that they can get away with.
Big policy announcements were also coming from other major countries as
they saw their own economies slide. For instance, the UK government

announced a $30 billion stimulus package (via a reduction in sales tax and
measures to help homeowners, pensioners, and small businesses); China cut
interest rates; and the EU outlined a $258 billion fiscal plan. Other central
banks also increased emergency lending measures (e.g., the Bank of Japan
implemented a new provision allowing commercial banks to borrow unlimited
funds from the central bank, collateralized). And in December, interest rates
were lowered across the developed world as the global economy slowed.

As for the US Federal Reserve, it cut its overnight rate to its lowest level ever
(between 0 percent and 0.25 percent), hitting the zero bound. Chairman
Bernanke noted: “the decision was historic.”56 Stocks rallied and the dollar fell
following the announcement, largely because it was clear that “printing
money,” buying debt, and providing big guarantees to do whatever was needed
to reverse this debt/liquidity crisis would occur.
The increased likelihood of a deal with the auto companies funded from TARP
also helped markets, not just because it helped those companies but because it
was emblematic of a more forceful approach to saving the system. TARP was
enacted to deal with financial institutions. Paulson repeatedly said that they
didn’t intend to use TARP funds for the autos, while the Bush Administration
made it clear that it didn’t want an auto bankruptcy and worked diligently with
Congress to prevent one by trying to get the legislative authority to use a
portion of the $25 billion that Congress had already appropriated to help the
autos meet fuel efficiency standards for emergency loans for restructuring.
There was real progress in this regard, with a bill passing in the House, but the
legislation stalled in the Senate in mid-December. On December 19, just before
leaving office, President Bush officially announced plans to extend $13.4 billion
in emergency loans to Chrysler and General Motors. By the end of the month,
the government expanded this bailout package unexpectedly, delivering
additional support to the auto industry (which buoyed stocks). Because TARP
money could only be given to financial institutions, the funds had to be
directed through the auto companies’ financing arm. Additionally, the financing affiliate of General Motors (GMAC) was approved to reorganize as a bank
(to receive federal aid), which allowed GMAC to start making new loans to less
credit-worthy borrowers. After that, they then helped the auto companies by
recapitalizing and rescuing their finance companies just before leaving office.
The market was also optimistic about the fiscal stimulus being pledged by
president-elect Obama. The transition exemplified the very best of political
behavior on the part of both transitioning presidents. Also, the continuity of
Bernanke and Geithner on the economic leadership team helped.

While all these moves were big, there was of course good reason to question whether the damage already done
was too great for a full recovery to occur. While stocks rallied on the hope of stimulus and progress with the
automakers, December ended with volatility (uncertainty) priced to remain high.

Having the template explained in Part 1 and understanding the dynamics of the Great Depression in the 1930s as
well as we did (and so many other deleveragings) helped us a lot. The chart below shows interest rates and
money supply (M0) since 1925 to encompass both periods. In both cases they hit virtually 0 percent and in both
cases “money printing” followed. Note that these were the only times since 1900 that these things happened, and
that, in both cases, immediately following this “money printing”/QE the markets and the economy bottomed.
Quantitative easing is like a giant shot of adrenalin to save a patient that is having a massive heart attack. The
only question I had in late 2008 was if this overdue and great move would work or if it had come too late.

Transition from an “Ugly” to a “Beautiful”
Deleveraging: 2009
It’s worth briefly recapping where the US economy was at this point. Virtually
every economic indicator looked to be falling extremely quickly. As an
illustration, in a single day in January, reports of employment cuts across
companies totaled 62,000. In addition to weak economic growth, there were
still at least five major financial institutions at risk of failure: Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America; each of these was bigger
than Lehman. And a new, untested administration was about to be handed the
reins. This note conveys our picture of the economy at the time:
(BDO) January 9: The US Economy Remains in Freefall…
The US economy remains in free-fall with the impact of the credit contraction
now hitting where it hurts most, employment. Initially the financial sector
suffered, then demand and now employment. The transition from demand to
employment was sealed when business revenues fell faster than costs in the
fourth quarter, compressing margins and driving earnings down (not yet
reported, but almost certainly occurred). Businesses were then motivated to
cut their biggest expense item, labor. The extreme pace of payroll reductions,
over 500 thousand per month in November and December, reflects business’s
attempt to sustain their operating earnings.
This is even more important than in most economic contractions given the
lack of credit. The lack of credit means that businesses must generate cash
flow internally; they cannot rely on a loan to get them through a cash bind.
This magnifies the pressure to lay off workers.
When President Obama took office on January 20, the markets began to focus
on the administration’s economic policies. Secretary Geithner’s announcement
of his financial stability plan on February 10 was seen as a major bellwether
for administration financial policies. He outlined57 broadly how he was going
to “clean up and strengthen the nation’s banks.” He explained that the
approach would stress test the nation’s major banks to determine which
institutions needed additional capital and that the administration would shore
up their capital with a combination of public and private funds. Investors were
uncertain about the details of Geithner’s plan: Would there be nationalizations; would losses be imposed on shareholders or taxpayers? Investors were
provided only with the broad strokes, leaving them to expect the worst. The
S&P fell 3 percent as Geithner spoke and ended the day down 4.9 percent.
Rumors that the Obama administration was considering nationalization
continued to circulate, so the Treasury, FDIC, OCC, OTS, and the Federal
Reserve released a joint statement to assure58 the public that nationalization
was a last resort outcome, stating: “Because our economy functions better
when financial institutions are well managed in the private sector, the strong
presumption of the Capital Assistance Program is that banks should remain in
private hands.” The “strong presumption” wasn’t enough—the S&P fell 3.5
percent on the day.

8.9 percent unemployment, and a 22 percent fall in housing prices. If they lacked
the capital to withstand the stress test, banks would turn to private markets first
and then public funds to fill the gap. Of course Geithner couldn’t yet provide the
funds until the Fed finished their assessment on how exactly the shortfall would
be filled. For about 18 months, we had regularly run our own estimates of bank
losses by analyzing their holdings, marking them to market, and then doing
scenario analysis. We were pretty confident that our estimates were good. So we
were eager to see what the Fed’s stress tests would look like, mostly to see if they
would forthrightly show the numbers and then deal with them.
In addition to Geithner’s Financial Stability Plan, the Obama administration
announced a series of other fiscal policies aimed at jumpstarting the economy
and getting credit flowing again. We won’t go into depth on all of them here,
but will give some details about the two most meaningful announcements:
••

On February 17, President Obama signed into law the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The stimulus totaled $787 billion,
with $288 billion specifically set aside for tax reductions, $144 billion
for state and local governments, $105 billion for infrastructure, and
the rest for federal spending programs. Notably, the tax reduction
was funneled to taxpayers within days—a virtually instantaneous
stimulus. The infrastructure spending, on the other hand, would take
years to ramp up as projects needed to be scoped and planned for, so it
mattered less in the short term.

••

On February 18, the administration announced a plan worth up to
$275 billion to address the housing crisis. With the goal of helping
“as many as nine million American homeowners refinance their
mortgages or avert foreclosure,” the Homeowner Affordability and
Stability Plan offered $75 billion in direct spending to keep at-risk
homeowners in their homes. It also provided incentives to lenders
to alter the terms of their loans to troubled borrowers to make
them more affordable. And it gave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an
additional $200 billion in financing.

The Eve of Nationalization?
“While nationalization seems to us the best
option it is still extremely dangerous. The goal
of nationalization is to re-capitalize these
institutions in an acceptable way, while
sustaining the basic underlying infrastructure of
the financial system.”

Over the course of February, US policy makers also announced or expanded
other policies—including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility
(TALF). TALF was a Fed policy which helped stimulate various types of
consumer loans by lending up to $1 trillion on a non-recourse basis to holders
of AAA asset-backed securities. It was set to begin on March 5 as an extension
of a number of liquidity programs set to expire at the end of April. Despite all
this stimulation, markets continued to fall, as shown in the chart below.

Reports of ongoing weakness in the financial sector and economy continued
to pile up. On Sunday March 1, news broke that AIG planned to report a $62
billion 4th quarter loss (the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history), and
that the Treasury and Fed had agreed to provide AIG with an additional $30
billion in capital and loosen the terms of its earlier loan to the insurer.
Markets plunged on Monday as fear of knock-on effects were triggered and
the first economic stat releases from February showed the economy contracting at an accelerating rate. Monthly auto sales fell 5.8 percent to the weakest
level since the early 1980s and the economy shed 651,000 jobs.
The next week opened with more of the same. On Monday, March 9, the
World Bank came out with a very pessimistic report and Warren Buffett said
that the economy had “fallen off a cliff.” The stock market fell by 1 percent.
Investor sentiment was extremely bearish and selling was exhausted. That
was the day the bottom in the US stock market and the top in the dollar were
made, though it was impossible to know that at the time.
Stocks surged 6.4 percent on Tuesday, led by a 38 percent jump in Citigroup
shares, following a memo to employees from Citigroup’s CEO stating that the
bank was once again profitable, a well-received speech by Chairman Bernanke
on reforms to financial regulation, and reports that lawmakers were close to
re-instituting the uptick rule to slow short-selling of stocks.

Policy Makers Launch Coordinated Counterattack:
March–April 2009
Behind the scenes, policy makers at the Fed and the Treasury department were planning a coordinated set of “shock and awe” policies
designed to shore up the financial system and provide the money
needed to make up for contracting credit. These policies were much more
aggressive than earlier easings, and were released in a sequence of mega-announcements. How they were announced magnified the impact on markets.
The first of these announcements came on March 18 when, in a move that
surprised markets, the Fed announced that it was expanding its QE purchases
of Agency MBS by $750 billion and agency debt by $100 billion, and that it
would expand its purchases to US government bonds, making up to $300
billion in purchases over the next six months. In addition to increased QE, the
Fed expanded the collateral that was eligible for TALF to a wider set of
financial assets and stated its continuing expectations of “keeping rates
exceptionally low for an extended period.”
The market action around the $1 trillion plus announcement was huge. There
was an enormous Treasury rally (the 48 basis point fall in yields was the
biggest change in a couple of decades), stocks rallied, the dollar sold off, and
gold rallied. The intraday charts below show how big the moves following the
announcement were.

Then, on March 23, Secretary Geithner announced an expanded set of
policies that aimed to buy $500 billion to $1 trillion worth of troubled assets
from banks. At the heart of the program was the three-part Public-Private
Investment Partnership (PPIP), which incentivized private investment firms
to buy banks’ bad assets using their own capital. In effect, it allowed firms to
leverage their investments in troubled assets using money borrowed from the
Fed, with a guarantee that they would not lose more than their initial investment if the assets fell below their initial value. In another move coordinated
with the Fed, Geithner also announced a possible expansion of TALF, to
finance residential and commercial MBS, and said the agencies were considering making legacy securities eligible for the program.
On the day of the announcement, the S&P rose 7.1 percent led by an 18 percent
rally in financial shares.
On March 24, The Fed and the Treasury each announced plans to overhaul
financial regulations and expand government power in seizing “too big to fail”
banks, as well as insurers, investment banks, and other investment funds. Two
days later, Secretary Geithner outlined a wider overhaul of financial regulations, which greatly increased federal regulatory oversight of insurance
companies, hedge funds, and private equity funds, with expanded regulatory
powers over any company deemed “too big to fail.” While not a key part of the
stimulative counter-attack, the move was well-received by markets.

170 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

At the end of March, Summers and Geithner oversaw a team led by Steven
Rattner, a smart financier, to create the plan that would push GM and
Chrysler into what Larry Summers described as a “cushioned bankruptcy.”
Bankruptcy would force the trade unions and creditors to negotiate ways to
reduce debts, and ample US government support (including a large guarantee
of GM’s car warrantees) would ensure that GM could remain functioning
while the company was restructured. While the automobile companies felt
they couldn’t function in bankruptcy, Summers thought that, with sufficient
support, a bankrupt automobile company could function, and that there was
no reason that the debt needed to be paid in full.
And then on April 2 came two major announcements. In the first, the G20
reported that it had reached an agreement on a greater than what we expected
increase to IMF funding. Specifically, G20 countries agreed to immediately
provide $250 billion in additional IMF financing, with the aim of eventually
adding up to $500 billion in new lending capacity to the IMF’s roughly $250
billion of existing liquid resources. The combination of dramatically expanded
IMF lending capacity and more flexible lending terms was expected to dramatically reduce the immediate liquidity needs of a number of emerging-market
countries. Emerging currencies soared following the announcement.
The second announcement came from the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB), which had passed two proposals to ease mark-to-market
accounting rules. The changes, which had been expected to pass for a couple
of weeks, gave banks more discretion in reporting the value of mortgage
securities. While markets embraced the move, at the time we thought that
these changes would have relatively little impact on banks’ abilities to write
off losses over time, while relieving some (but not all) of the accounting
pressures on insurance companies.
The size of the coordinated government response to the credit crisis was
unprecedented. At the time, we characterized the moves as “an enormous
wave.” The first table below, which we shared with our clients at the time,
adds up all of the US government purchases and guarantees that had been
announced by April 2009. Remarkably, the US government was backstopping two-thirds of all debt, about $29 trillion dollars.

While President Bush took a more hands off approach, believing his team
knew best what to do and supporting them to do it, President Obama took a
hands on approach, digging into the facts and numbers and being actively
engaged in discussions about issues. He instituted a presidential daily
economic briefing, analogous to the daily national security briefing. Every
morning, the president met with his economic team, and for the first months,
every one of those meetings was about the ongoing crisis. According to Larry
Summers, the president read every word they sent him, and he was very much
into understanding what the approach was, why they recommended it, and
what alternatives were being turned down. It was a time when market and
economic developments were more important than anything else.
How investors fared in the bear market varied a lot. They generally fell into
three broad categories: 1) those who were clobbered and let their fears prompt
them to reduce their risks (sell “risky” assets) the more they got clobbered, 2)
those who were clobbered and had blind faith that in the end things would
work out, so they held on or even bought more risky assets, and 3) those who
had a pretty good understanding of what was happening and did a good job of
selling high and buying low. There were very few in the third group.
As for us, while we had done a good job up until that point, we didn’t want to
take on hardly any bets at this stage. Back in the 2007 bubble, the gap between
what was discounted in market pricing and what was likely appeared very
large to us. Now market pricing was discounting a terrible set of conditions
and the range of potential outcomes was enormous. While policy makers were
making the right moves, whether they would work and what else lay beneath
the surface in exposures remained unknown.

172 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

A little later in April, we wrote in reference to the degree of money printing
and stimulus spending: “Like pandemics, D-processes come along very
infrequently, so we don’t have many to look back on and, in those that we
have, this antidote was never administered in this dosage.”
In these crises there is no such thing as getting everything exactly
right, especially in the eyes of everyone. There was a public uproar over
the Treasury’s actions, especially about how “generous” its deal was for banks
that were recapitalized, and how bankers weren’t being punished. Reports
that AIG had paid large, previously-committed bonuses after it received a
bailout from the Treasury focused on how Secretary Geithner knew about the
bonuses and allowed them to be paid out. The reports infuriated a public
already upset with government bailouts of financial institutions and put the
Treasury’s plans for further action at risk.
Such reactions are classic. As economic pain increases, populist calls to
“punish the bankers that caused this mess” are the norm and they make
it difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are necessary to
save the financial system and the economy. At such times bankers can
want to stop “being bankers” by stopping investing or lending. Their doing so
in the midst of the crisis would make the crisis much worse.
While the financial crisis and how it was handled contributed somewhat to
the rise of populism in subsequent years, in the end saving the system is much
more important than striving for precision. Larry Summers makes the
comparison to battlefield medicine—it’s never perfect, you’re going to realize
you made mistakes, and you’re going to look bad, even if you do the best
possible job. I can’t say this enough: in my opinion, judging the policy makers
in this way is unfair. The fact that they do their job anyway, and that they help
as many people as they do, is what makes them heroes in my eyes.
In mid-March, at the peak of the controversy, members of Congress and the
media were publicly calling for Secretary Geithner’s resignation, even though
he had executed his job with great skill, wisdom, and care. Had they
succeeded in forcing a resignation or otherwise derailed the Treasury’s bold
and necessary plans to recapitalize the banking system, the bad economic
consequences would have been large.
Geithner wrote the following in his book, conveying the challenge of handling
public outrage:
“The public outrage was appropriate, and I understood why the
President wanted to embrace it, but I didn’t see how we could ever
satisfy it. We had no legal authority to confiscate the bonuses that had
been paid during the boom. We had no power to set compensation for
most private firms. We had more authority over firms receiving TARP
funds, but we couldn’t reduce bonuses to levels that the public might
find acceptable without unleashing an exodus of talent from those
banks, reducing their prospects of navigating their way to safety. In any
case, I thought the public’s rage on these issues was insatiable. I feared
the tougher we talked about the bonuses, the more we would own them,
fueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry.”59

A New Plan to Help Modify Second Mortgages
“The Obama administration sought to expand

the new plan, the Treasury Department will
offer cash incentives and subsidies to lenders
who agree to substantially reduce the
monthly payments on second mortgages or
forgive those loans entirely.”
–New York Times

The uproar ultimately faded after President Obama strongly stood behind
Tim. But after what was seen as Geithner’s lack of action, the House of
Representatives passed a bill on March 19 that put a 90 percent tax on bonuses
paid out by companies that received government bailouts worth $5 billion or
more. While the scope of the tax was limited mostly to the AIG bonuses, the
sense of distrust for government support among many executives in the
financial sector (who saw the tax as the government changing the rules after
the fact) would be a continuing source of tension.
Fortunately, the bottoms in the markets and the economy were being made,
because had things gotten any worse or gone on any longer our capitalist and
democratic system would’ve been at risk of breaking. All else being equal,
prices for goods, services, and investment assets go down when a rate of
buying lessens and go up when the rate of selling lessens. For that reason,
tops are typically made when the rate of buying is unsustainable (which
is also when people think prices will rise) and bottoms are made when
the rate of selling is at a pace that’s unsustainable (typically when most
people are bearish). In the weeks before and after the big announcements,
pressures eased, signs of an economic rebound emerged, and markets rallied.
A series of economic releases during the first week of April showed that while
the economy continued to contract during March, the pace of contraction was
slower than expected. And as the charts below show, while the major
economic stats continued contracting through March at the fastest pace in
decades, the contractions looked to be leveling off and maybe reversing.

The Bank Stress Test
One of the key questions for determining whether the US was headed for a
sustained recovery was the health of the banks. Despite recent drips of good
news, there wasn’t broad transparency on whether the banks were still
encumbered by toxic assets or a big need for capital. We had been running our
numbers for months and saw huge numbers that weren’t being brought to
light or being dealt with. But in February Tim Geithner said the Fed was going
to do those stress tests. I didn’t know if they would fudge the numbers to
make them look better than they were or if they’d tell it like it was so they
could deal with the problems appropriately.
On May 7 the Fed released its results. In response I wrote:
(BDO) May 7: We Agree!
The Stress Test numbers and ours are nearly the same!!! The regulators did an
excellent job of explaining exactly what they did for this stress test and
showing the numbers that produced the results. They did virtually exactly
what we did since we started putting out our loss estimates nearly two years
ago, and their numbers are essentially the same as ours. The differences
between our numbers and theirs are more a matter of terminology than of
substance. For example, the biggest difference between their estimates and
ours is due to the number of years they and we are counting—i.e., their loss
estimate is for the losses that will occur over the next two years and ours is
for the total amount of losses that will be taken on these assets over the lives
of these assets. As there will be losses in years 3, 4, etc., in addition to those in
the first two years, naturally the total losses (i.e., ours) will be greater than
the losses incurred over the next two years (i.e., theirs). We won’t conjecture
why they did it that way, though we do know from our projections that the
maximum capital needs (i.e., when earnings fall short relative to losses) is
probably at the end of two years. Anyway, that accounts for most of the
difference in our total loss estimates, and in addition we may also have a
slightly worse economic scenario than they do. Once these adjustments are
made, we see essentially the same picture. What a relief!!! For the first time in
the last two years we are confident that the regulators really do understand
the scale of the banking problem!
Tim Geithner, who read Bridgewater Daily Observations daily throughout the
crisis, took this one to President Obama. In his memoir, he described the
moment as follows:

June 4, 2009
Jobless Claims Decline Slightly, the First Time in
20 Weeks
“The number of people on the unemployment
insurance rolls fell slightly last week for the first
time in 20 weeks, and the tally of new jobless
claims also dipped, the government said
Thursday...The report provides a glimmer of
good news for job seekers, though both
declines were small and the figures remain
significantly above the levels associated with a
healthy economy.”
–New York Times

“The next morning, I walked into the Oval Office for the President’s daily
economics briefing with a report from Bridgewater Associates, the world’s
largest hedge fund firm. Many experts, including Larry, regarded
Bridgewater’s Daily Observations as among the smartest and most
credible sources of private-sector economic analysis—and among the
darkest about the banks. In front of the economic team and the President’s
political advisers, I handed that day’s Observations to the President...
I wasn’t dancing in the end zone, but that was a good day for the home
team.”60
We were in sync about what was and what needed to be done about it. What a
relief!

The Beginning of the Beautiful Deleveraging:
June–December 2009:
In the second half of 2009, the policies (i.e., providing liquidity via QE, capital
via fiscal policies, and other supports via macro-prudential policies) reduced
risks and increased the buying and prices of “riskier” assets, and the economy
began to recover. This shift was analogous to others that produced “beautiful
deleveragings” for reasons explained earlier.

While we won’t discuss all the improving news of this period in depth, we
will highlight two points. First, frequent concerns over inflation stemming
from the fast pace of central bank printing didn’t materialize, which fortunately laid to rest the incorrect belief that printing a lot of money would cause
inflation to accelerate. The Fed’s “printing money” would not cause an
acceleration of inflation if it was replacing contracting credit.

Reflations don’t necessarily cause inflation because they can
simply negate deflations, depending on how far they are taken
and what the money goes to.
It is overly simplistic to talk about “inflation” because “inflation” is an
average of many things that behave differently from one another. For
example, when an economy is depressed, during reflations (which is
normally the case, because otherwise there’s no need for reflations),
there is little or no inflation in labor costs and assets that are used for

passing of Dodd-Frank. The proposal included heightened regulation,
consolidation of existing regulatory bodies (with greater regulatory
authority given to the Fed), more consumer protections, more
regulation of credit rating agencies, and updated rules around
winding down banks, among many other components. The bill itself
wouldn’t be passed until 2010.

Changing laws in ways that would have made the crisis less bad are
typical at the end of big debt crises. Then, over long time frames (e.g., 25
years), as the hangover wears off and a new euphoria sets in, these laws are
increasingly flouted and new forms of leverage are produced by new forms of
entities, leading to a new debt crisis that evolves similarly.

Bridgewater Daily Observations (BDO)

As 2010 began, the financial markets were strong (up nearly 65 percent from
their March 2009 lows) because they were flush with liquidity thanks to the
Fed’s QE, and they were safer due to fiscal and regulatory changes. But the
economy labored because many borrowers were weaker and more cautious,
and lending standards had tightened.

Now, the markets started to discount a move to normalcy. The credit markets
priced in that the Fed would tighten two or three times within the year—
roughly the amount of tightening you’d expect in a standard business-cycle
recovery from a recession. That was odd given conditions. Unemployment
rates were still a hair away from post-war highs, wage growth was stuck,
homes prices were flat at well-below the prior peak (meaning many middleclass mortgage borrowers remained underwater), credit standards were
tightened, and borrowers who were still okay financially remained disinclined
to lever up, while those who were inclined to lever up were financially dead. It
was hard to imagine there would be a normal pickup.

Around this time, most of the world’s central banks and governments were
slowing their aggressive rates of stimulus. The Fed ended the first round of
quantitative easing in March after purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed
securities. The pace of fiscal stimulus from programs like the America Recovery
and Reinvestment Act were set to peak later in the year. Abroad, there were
pockets of tightening as countries like China increased interest rates.
Importantly, at this point it wasn’t clear to investors that merely slowing or
ending quantitative easing was equivalent to tightening—and not that
different from raising interest rates. Some thought it was enough to simply
pump a lot of money into the economy to stimulate it—and the Fed had certainly
done that, printing over $2 trillion. But the flow of money was more important
than the amount of money, as it was this flow of asset purchases that helped
sustain their increases in value and the growth of lending to buyers in the
economy, because credit growth remained slow. Yet the Fed’s amount of stimulation was then popularly believed to be too much and irresponsible. We had a
different view, doubting that developed economies would tighten as fast as what
others thought and had priced in. We laid it out in the Daily Observations of
February 17:

“While monetization policies are currently

viewed like a light switch that works in an
all-or-none sort of way; it should be viewed like
a spigot that regulates the flow in degrees. It
works similar to interest rate cuts or putting
your foot on the accelerator of a car. When
doing either, you judge the right amount
primarily by watching the reactions. When
things start to pick up, you start to let off.
When things start to slow down, you start to
press the pedal harder. The same is true for
monetizations. In our view, it is time for the Fed
to put its foot back down on the monetization
accelerator.”

(BDO) February 17: The Coming Tightening
It is now the established view among the electorate, central bankers, and
elected officials that central banks printing and buying of financial assets and
central governments budget deficits must be reined in because these actions
are financially irresponsible. We think that this universally accepted view is at
best premature and at worst dangerous….When we take a sharp pencil to these
plans and their implications, we conclude that it is too much restraint—unless
there is either major pickup in private debt growth or a major realignment of
developed and emerging country currencies, both of which appear unlikely to
happen in the amounts required.
At the same time, we did our pro forma financial projections in Europe and saw
a debt crisis brewing there due to a mismatch between: a) the amount of
borrowing debtors needed to rollover maturing debt and sustain what they were
doing, and b) the amount of lending that would be required to come from banks
that had already stretched their balance sheets. In February, several of Europe’s
more indebted countries—Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and especially
Greece—struggled to meet their debt obligations and were facing deteriorating
economic conditions. While the news flow associated with this led to some
day-to-day volatility in global markets, most assessed the issue to be contained
to Greece (and potentially Portugal) and that it would not pose larger problems
for the European monetary system or the global economy. In a note to clients in
early February, we calculated that the problem would probably be much worse:
(BDO) February 4: Tightening + Over-indebtedness = High Risk

But the European debt crisis is a different story. While I won’t go into it now,
it is noteworthy that the same sequence of events followed, in that policy
makers didn’t believe they would face a debt crisis until they had it. When it
came, they made the same rookie mistakes of leaning too heavily on deflationary levers like austerity and of not printing money and of not providing
protections against defaults for systemically important entities until the pain
became intolerable.
From May until July, the US equity market, which had rallied nearly 10 percent
from the start of the year through late April, fell over 15 percent, largely on
contagion worries about Europe and softness in the US economic numbers.

180 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

That weakness led to the realization that the Fed was likely to maintain its
course on its 0-percent-interest-rate policy. US bond yields fell over 100 basis
points over the next four months. The pace of improvement in the economy
slowed in the summer of 2010. Timely reads on labor market health showed
only modest improvement in unemployment claims, while the unemployment
rate was still near highs. There was still a lot of slack in the economy.
Weakness at this level of economic activity would have been terrible.

Bernanke addressed further QE in a speech in Jackson Hole, making it clear
that it was a key policy option if needed, saying, “a first option for providing
additional monetary accommodation, if necessary, is to expand the Federal
Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.”62 He also emphasized his belief
that QE had been effective and had “made an important contribution to the
economic stabilization and recovery.” As the chart below shows, the 10-year
break-even inflation rate had fallen by 50 basis points in the several months
leading up to Bernanke’s August speech, reflecting concerns of sustained very
low inflation or deflation. However, after he signaled that further QE was a
strong possibility, the markets rebounded strongly. The real economy response
naturally lagged the essentially instantaneous market response, but it wasn’t
long before growth picked up as well.

“We see overall growth rates decelerating, debt

against that backdrop that the ECB is
‘normalizing’ its balance sheet (both by letting
its longer-term lending facilities roll off and by
decreasing the pace of its asset purchases), and
as a result pushing up both short-term interest
rates and the euro. This de facto tightening of
monetary policy seems like a mistake to us, and
we suspect will cause conditions to deteriorate

eventually cause the ECB to reverse course

(BDO) October 6: The Next Shoe to Drop: More QE and Devaluations
What is happening is all very classic. Though they’re all different, in most
ways deleveragings are basically the same and transpire via a similar sequence
of events. As we have described them in the Daily Observations and in our
“Template for Understanding What’s Going On,” we won’t dwell on this
sequence, but will remind you of a few things that we think are especially
relevant now.
All deleveragings are due to declines in private sector credit growth that require
increases in both central bank money creation and central government deficits
in order to offset the effects of the decline in private sector credit. Though many
of us are financially conservative and feel that there is something unethical
about printing money to bail out debtors and creditors, it is important to
recognize that austerity to deal with debt-deleveraging problems has never
worked when these problems were big. When austerity has been tried, even in
persistent attempts to get out of debt, it has eventually been abandoned by all
governments because it didn’t work, and it was too painful. That is because the
decreased borrowing and spending (and consequences of these on employment
and many other pain points) make this type of deleveraging as self-reinforcing
on the downside as the increased debts and spending that cause bubbles is on
the upside. As a result, all of the deleveragings that we have studied (which is
most of those that occurred over the last couple of hundred years) eventually led
to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits and currency devaluations
(against gold, commodities, and stocks).
The QE broadly worked in providing additional needed stimulus. Despite
continued debt problems in Europe, the US economy and markets finished
2010 on a high note. Growth picked up after a brief lull between QE1 and QE2,
the S&P 500 had 13 percent total returns for 2010, and inflation expectations
had been re-anchored by the Fed’s proven determination to continue stimulating as long as necessary. On March 15 of 2011, this is how we saw domestic
conditions as they developed:
(BDO) March 15: Transitioning Beyond the “Sweet Spot”
As previously mentioned, it is pretty clear that the US economy is going
through a post-contraction growth spurt that is being supported by monetary
policy, fiscal policy and an improvement in credit growth. As this recovery is
occurring with both a) considerable slack domestically (and in Europe and
Japan) and b) overheating demand in emerging countries, we see limited
inflation pressures, with those pressures that exist largely coming via the
prices of items that are being demanded by emerging countries. Said differently, 2010/2011 in a cyclical context appears quite like the “sweet spot”
part of the cycle that typically occurs during the first two years of a
recovery, when there remains adequate slack and low inflation
pressures. However, this recovery from a contraction is taking place during a
deleveraging and therefore has been more dependent on the Fed’s printing of
money and the central government’s fiscal stimulus.

182 Part 2: US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

By this point, it was clear that the governments different programs to support
the financial system broadly worked. Compared to other countries, the US
financial system experienced:
••

A relatively fast speed at which the financial system was recapitalized
(and that TARP capital was repaid)

••

A relatively fast speed at which they unwound emergency credit
programs

••

Good overall financial returns on the rescue across the various
programs.

We will end this case study here, because in the second quarter of 2011 real
GDP returned to its pre-crisis levels. This wasn’t the end of the recovery by
any means. There was still plenty of slack in the economy and a self-reinforcing upward cycle. The charts below show the unemployment rate, GDP
growth, the GDP gap (showing the estimated amount of slack in the economy’s capacity to produce), and the S&P 500 stock market index from 2006
until the writing of this on the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Lehman debt
crisis. The shaded bars show where they were in 2Q 2011. The second set of
charts show existing and projected debt-to-GDP ratios from 1920 until 10
years from now. These numbers do not include non-debt obligations such as
those for pensions and health care, which are considerably larger than debts.
But that’s another issue to be explained at another time.

News &
Bridgewater Daily Observations (BDO)
March 10, 2011
Increasing Global Divergences
“As you know, we divide the world into debtors
and creditors, and we divide each of these
groups into those with independent monetary
policies and those with linked monetary
policies. We believe that debtors with linked
monetary policies (i.e., who can’t print money)
will experience many years of hardship and
economic weakness, and that creditors who
can’t stop printing money because they have
linked exchange rates will go through an
extended period of overheating. We also
believe that these pressures will intensify over
the next 18 months, leading to cracks and
seismic shifts in these linkages. These views
influence our market positioning in credit
spreads, yield curves, currencies, commodities
and equities.”

Glossary of Key Economic Terms
Below we explain some of the economic concepts used in Part 3 (and other parts of the books as well). These
explanations are simplified for brevity.
balance of payments: The balance of all of the transactions (i.e., purchases of goods, services, financial assets,
and other payments) between people/organizations in a particular country/currency and the rest of the world.
Think of the transaction balance for a particular type of good—e.g., when someone in a country buys oil, they
give up some form of capital to get the oil. When the balance of payments worsens, it’s like when a family’s
financial condition worsens because inflows (the revenue and lending it gets) goes down relative to its
expenditures, and when the balance of payments improves, the reverse is true.
balance-of-payments crisis: A type of economic crisis in which there is a worsening of the balance of payments
so that a country’s entities lack adequate buying power in world markets to meet its needs. The country has
essentially run out of cash and credit.
bubble: A stage of the debt cycle that typically sees self-reinforcing and unsustainable rises in debt, asset prices,
and growth. The key word here is “unsustainable,” so that the temporary boom conditions will be followed by a
bust. Imagine borrowing a lot of money to live an expensive life style; it can continue for the near term but is
unsustainable and will result in bad times when the adjustment happens.
capital inflows/outflows: The movement of money and credit across borders to buy capital/investment assets
(like bonds, currency, equities, a factory, etc.). Foreigners buying/selling a country’s assets are ‘inflows’ and
domestic players buying/selling foreign assets are ‘outflows.’
core inflation: Inflation that excludes the prices of especially volatile goods, such as commodities.
currency peg: An exchange rate policy in which a country tries to keep its currency at a fixed value to another
currency, a mix of currencies, or an asset such as gold.
current account balance: Exports minus imports plus net income receipts. Think of it as essentially being net
income (income minus expenses). If a country has a current account deficit, its expenses are more than its
income, so it has to make up the difference with capital transactions (like borrowing or selling equity) that are
accounted for in the capital account balance.
debt service: The cost of maintaining debts over a given period, including interest and principal payments.
deleveraging: The process of reducing debt burdens.
deleveraging attribution: Bridgewater analysis of what led to increases or decreases in debt burdens. The black
dot represents the annualized change in debt as a percentage of GDP over the period. (A positive percentage
means a country’s debt levels have increased, and vice versa.) We then show what caused this change: above 0
represents something that increased debt burdens, and below 0 represents something that decreased debt
burdens. We show factors that increase or decrease GDP (e.g., inflation and real growth), and factors that
increase or decrease debt (e.g., a country borrowing to cover interest payments or other new borrowing). Note
that the attribution methodology differs between countries, mostly depending on data availability.
depression: A severe economic downturn at the stage of a debt crisis that typically involves self-reinforcing
declines in asset prices and growth. This most classically occurs when central banks are limited in their abilities
to ease monetary policy to relieve the economic downturn.
easing: Central bank monetary policy moves that have the effect of making money and credit more available,
usually either by lowering interest rates, printing money, changing regulations, or central government fiscal
policy moves of changing spending, taxation, or regulations.

fiscal balance: Whether a government is spending more than it earns in tax revenue. A government running a
deficit is spending more than it earns (and must either be borrowing or spending down savings), while a
government running a surplus is earning more than it spends.
foreign FX returns: The returns an investor experiences by investing in a foreign currency. Incorporates both
the change in the exchange rate and the interest that the investor earns above or below what he or she would
earn at home.
FX: Foreign exchange rate.
FX debt: Debt denominated in a currency other than that of an investor’s home country.
GDP: Gross domestic product; this represents the total value (i.e., price times quantity) of all final goods and
services produced in a country. GDP is the most commonly used means of representing the size of an economy.
Often, we’ll express other economic concepts as a percentage of GDP (e.g., debt), to give a sense of whether those
are large or small in the context of a particular economy.
GDP gap: An imprecise measure of whether an economy is operating at a high rate of capacity or a low rate of
capacity. It is based on the difference between what an economy is producing today versus the level of production
it is estimated to be able to sustain over a longer period of time without negative consequences (known as an
economy’s “potential”). If an economy has a negative GDP gap, it is producing at a level that has slack (e.g.,
factories aren’t running at full capacity). If an economy has a positive GDP gap, it is producing at a level in which
there is very little slack. This is often referred to as an “output gap” or “slack.”
liquidity: A measure of whether money and credit are relatively scarce or readily available. When liquidity is low,
money and credit are scarce and, in order to borrow, even very creditworthy borrowers have to pay a higher interest
rate. When liquidity is high, creditworthy borrowers have no trouble borrowing and pay lower interest rates.
long rate: Interest rates on longer term debt. The nominal long rate we show for this is typically the 10-year
government bond yield.
money 0: A measure of the total amount of money that has been printed in a certain currency, usually based on
the amount of physical currency in circulation plus reserves held at a central bank. Also referred to as M0.
nominal growth: The change in the value (i.e., price times quantity) of what a country produces (e.g., its GDP).
“Nominal” refers to the fact that this includes cases where prices rise from inflation, as opposed to real growth
(see below).
potential: An imprecise measure of the level of production an economy is estimated to be able to sustain when
operating near capacity. GDP gap represents whether an economy’s current level of production is higher or lower
than potential.
real: Economic terms that include the word “real” are adjusted to remove the impact of inflation. See the next
few items in the glossary for some examples. Importantly, there is often no precision to these measures (e.g., a
country’s precise real FX is unknowable).
real FX: An imprecise measure of whether the currency is cheap or expensive based on looking at the relative
currency levels and relative price levels of countries today relative to what they were in the past. A positive real FX
represents a currency that is more expensive and a negative one means it’s cheaper using this measure. Usually
measured versus a country’s trade partners (i.e. a trade-weighted index or TWI).
real GDP: An imprecise measure of the quantity of goods and services produced in a country (as opposed to the
total value of goods and services produced, which is influenced by inflation).
real growth: An imprecise measure of the change in the quantity of goods and services produced in a country
(as opposed to nominal growth, which is influenced by inflation).

Part 3: Glossary of Key Economic Terms

real interest rates: Interest rates that have been adjusted to take out the effects of inflation. If the real interest
rate is negative, inflation is running higher than the amount of interest being earned, meaning that lenders are
losing buying power over time.
reflation: Instances when monetary policy is easy/stimulative and helps produce an economic recovery.
reserves: A country’s holding of foreign currency and/or gold savings—essentially the government’s savings in
foreign currency that can be drawn upon to make purchases and used to affect the supply, demand, and price of
its own currency.
short rate: Interest rates on lending for very short periods of time, usually 3 months or less.
stimulation: See “easing.”
tightening: Policy moves that reduce the availability of money and credit, which has the effect of slowing
economic growth, usually by increasing interest rates, allowing money supplies to shrink, cutting government
spending, or changing rules to restrict bank lending.
yield curve: The difference between shorter-term interest rates and longer-term interest rates. If short rates are
above longer-term rates, the yield curve is said to be inverted, meaning short-term interest rates are priced to
fall. If short rates are below longer-term rates, short-term interest rates are priced to rise.

48 Debt Crises
This section goes through each of the 48 debt crises we examined, so that you can live through them on your own.
This case list was generated by us systematically screening for periods of deleveraging across major countries over
the last century—focusing on those cases with a real GDP decline of more than 3%—as well as triangulating that
list against the work of others like the IMF and prominent academics. This by no means encapsulates all the debt
crises that have occurred over the past century, but it provides a good sample of debt crises and deleveragings that
highlight the key similarities (as discussed in Part 1) as well as the differences.
Each case includes a simple computer-generated text analysis of what happened along with a bunch of charts
showing the basic stats. These “auto-text” comments are observations of the basic stats and they present a very
simplified version of our algorithmic analysis. I am providing you with these to show you how, by viewing cases
through a simplified lens (based on the even more simplified template explained in Part 1), the important things
pop. Note how the perspective you gain by seeing these situations in a simple way contrasts with the perspective
you get when viewing the more complete blizzard of details described in Part 2. I hope seeing the cases at this
level helps you more easily see the principle-level commonalities and differences explained in the “Archetypal Big
Debt Crisis” template.

United States 1926–1936 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the United States
experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle
between 1926 and 1936.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1926 and 1929, the United States experienced a
bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising
debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. By the
bubble’s end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 125% of
GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United States’s
domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically,
too. Aided by that rising debt, growth was strong (at 3%),
while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap
peaked at 13%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities
averaged 31% annualized returns over the bubble period)
encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth.
During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate
tightening (with short rates rising around 250 bps). Taken
together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening
money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1929 to
1933. High debt levels left the United States vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of the 1929 stock market
crash. The United States suffered from self-reinforcing
declines in GDP (falling by 26%), in stock prices (falling by
84%) and in home prices (falling by 24%). Unemployment
rates increased by 23%. The United States’s financial
institutions also came under considerable pressure. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the
United States needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP
went up by 98% (26% annualized), driven by a mix of falling
real incomes, deflation, and interest payments financed with
new debt.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy
makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the
deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of
reflation, which began in 1933. In terms of monetary policy,
the government broke the peg to gold, M0 increased by 6% of
GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and
real FX averaged -5% during the stimulative phase. Over the
cycle, the United States was very aggressive in managing its
financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 8 out of 9 classic
policy levers. In particular, it provided liquidity and directly
purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring
nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with
growth averaging 8% during this period and sovereign long
rates falling to 3%). During this phase, unemployment rates
declined by 14% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 70% (21%
annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right.
Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios was driven primarily by rising real
incomes and to a lesser extent by inflation. It took 7 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in
USD terms recovered within 25 years.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of the United
States, as it helped set the stage for FDR, whom many people
consider a populist leader, to take power.

United Kingdom 1927–1936 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom
experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle
between 1927 and 1936.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, the United Kingdom didn’t
experience a broad-based bubble in the years before the
crisis, but it was tied to other countries, economies, and
financial markets that were experiencing bubble-like
conditions. And it did build up a substantial debt stock, with
debts reaching 210% of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case,
the debt was in the United Kingdom’s domestic currency,
and the majority was owned domestically, too.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1929 to
1931. High debt levels left the United Kingdom vulnerable to
a shock—which came in the form of ripples from a stock
crash in the US and the early Great Depression. The United
Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 10%), and in stock prices (falling by 61%).
Unemployment rates increased by 7%. As shown in the
attribution chart to the right, even though the United
Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went
up by 13% (6% annualized), driven primarily by interest
payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by
falling real incomes. This was partially offset by paying
down existing debt.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

As shown in the charts to the right, France experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1926 and 1938.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1926 and 1929, France experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth and
strong equity returns. Debts actually declined by 13% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis level of 205% of GDP.
In this case, the debt was in France’s domestic currency,
and the majority was owned domestically, too. Growth was
strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high
(the GDP gap peaked at 9%). Furthermore, strong asset
returns (equities averaged 45% annualized returns over the
bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to
stimulate growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures,
combined with tightening money and credit and the
weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1929 to
1936. High debt levels left France vulnerable to a shock—
which came in the form of ripples from a stock crash in the
US and the early Great Depression. France suffered from
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 17%), and in
stock prices (falling by 57%). France’s financial institutions
also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the
attribution chart to the right, even though France needed a
deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was roughly flat through
this period.

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began
in 1936. In terms of monetary policy, the government broke
the peg to gold, interest rates were ultimately pushed down
to 2%, and real FX averaged -4% during the stimulative
phase. Importantly, policy makers allowed inflation to run
high (averaging 10% during this period), which boosted
nominal growth and helped reduce the domestic debt
burden. Over the cycle, France was somewhat aggressive in
managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 3
out of 9 classic policy levers. This stimulation helped bring
nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with
growth averaging 15% during this period and sovereign long
rates falling to 4%). During this phase, debt as a % of GDP
fell by 37% (15% annualized), as shown in the attribution
chart to the right. Throughout this “beautiful” period, the
reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from
income rising, driven primarily by higher inflation. It took
21 years before real GDP reached its prior peak.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of France, as
it helped set the stage for Leon Blum, whom many people
consider a populist leader, to take power in 1936.

United Kingdom 1941–1967 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom
experienced a classic wartime deflationary deleveraging
cycle between 1941 and 1967. As is typical for winners of big
wars, the United Kingdom experienced a brief postwar
recession as the economy transitioned away from war
production, and a more orderly deleveraging.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The War Phase
Unlike the typical case that entails a bubble, this debt crisis
had its roots in WW2. During the war, the United Kingdom
borrowed a lot of money to finance its big fiscal deficit,
shifted much of its economy to war production, and shifted
much of its workforce to the armed services and war
production. For these reasons, the economic stats are not
reflective of typical economic linkages. Through the war,
debts rose sharply. In this case, the debt was in the United
Kingdom’s domestic currency, and the majority was owned
domestically, too. Aided by wartime spending, growth was
strong through this period (at 6%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 10%). Meanwhile,
strong asset returns (equities averaged 16% annualized
returns over the war period) helped to stimulate growth.

The Post-War Phase
As the war neared an end, the United Kingdom entered a
postwar recession, which ran from 1943 to 1947. Since the
United Kingdom won the war, its post-war slump was less
bad than it was for the losers. Nevertheless, the United
Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 15%). As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though the United Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 102% (25% annualized)
as incomes declined and as the government continued to
shoulder war-related costs (with a peak fiscal deficit of 31%
of GDP during the ugly period).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy
makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the
deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of
reflation, which began in 1947. In terms of monetary policy,
the government devalued the currency versus gold by 30%,
M0 actually decreased by 8% of GDP, interest rates were

the domestic debt burden. This and other stimulative
measures helped bring nominal growth well above nominal
interest rates (with growth averaging 7% during this period
and sovereign long rates falling to 2%). During this phase,
unemployment rates were flat and debt as a % of GDP fell by
139% (7% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to
the right. Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction
in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising,
driven primarily by higher inflation. It took 10 years before

As shown in the charts to the right, the United States
experienced a classic wartime deflationary deleveraging
cycle between 1943 and 1951. As is typical for winners of big

The Post-War Phase
When the fighting ended, the United States entered a
postwar recession, which ran from 1945 to 1950. Since the
United States won the war, its post-war slump was less bad

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began
in 1950. In terms of monetary policy, M0 actually decreased
by 0.9% of GDP and interest rates were ultimately pushed
down to 1% during the stimulative phase. The central bank’s
choice to stay easy even as activity picked up sharply helped
bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates
(with growth averaging 11% during this period and
sovereign long rates averaging 2%). During this phase,
unemployment rates declined by 2% and debt as a % of GDP
fell by 22% (14% annualized), as shown in the attribution

reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from
income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It

Norway 1984–1996 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Norway experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1984 and 1996.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1984 and 1987, Norway experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth,
strong equity returns, and strong housing returns. By the
bubble’s end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 211% of
GDP. In this case, the debt was in Norway’s domestic
currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too.
During the bubble phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 4% of GDP, which helped to
finance a current account deficit of 2% of GDP. Aided by
that capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (housing prices averaged
19% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged
more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During
this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening
(with short rates rising around 700 bps). Taken together,
these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money
and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1987 to
1992. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 58% of
GDP, making Norway vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of ripples from commodity price declines. Norway
suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by
4%) and in home prices (falling by 38%). Norway’s financial
institutions also came under considerable pressure. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though
Norway needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was
roughly flat through this period.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Norway 1984–1996 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began
in 1992. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 2% of
GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 4%, and
real FX averaged 3% during the stimulative phase. Over the
cycle, Norway was aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic policy
levers. In particular, it nationalized banks and provided
liquidity. It also enacted structural reforms designed to
increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped
bring nominal growth close to nominal interest rates (with
growth averaging 6.1% during this period and sovereign
long rates falling to 5.5%). During this phase, unemployment
rates declined by 4% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 35% (7%
annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right.
Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising,
driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 5 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak.

Finland 1987–2001 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Finland experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987 and
2001.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1987 and 1989, Finland experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth and
strong equity returns. By the bubble’s end, debts had
reached a pre-crisis peak of 272% of GDP. In this case, the
debt was in Finland’s domestic currency, though a high
share was owned by foreigners, which left Finland with
some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were low but positive,
averaging around 3% of GDP, while Finland maintained a
current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that capital,
growth was strong (at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset
returns (equities averaged 18% annualized returns over the
bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to
stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers
initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around
700 bps). Competitiveness became an issue, as Finland’s
real FX peaked at +24%. Taken together, these bubble
pressures and Finland’s dependence on foreign financing,
combined with tightening money and credit, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1989 to
1993. High debt levels left Finland vulnerable to a shock—
which came in the form of asset price declines hitting bank
solvency. Finland suffered from self-reinforcing declines in
GDP (falling by 12%), in stock prices (falling by 36%) and in
home prices (falling by 32%). Unemployment rates increased
by 13%. Finland’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to
the right, even though Finland needed a deleveraging, its
debt as a % GDP went up by 32% (9% annualized) as
incomes declined.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy
makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the
deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of
reflation, which began in 1993. In terms of monetary policy,
M0 increased by 7% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately
pushed down to 3%, and real FX averaged -10% during the
stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Finland was very
aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad
debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it
nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly
purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring
nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with
growth averaging 6% during this period and sovereign long
rates falling to 4%). During this phase, unemployment rates
declined by 6% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 72% (8%
annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right.
Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising,
driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 7 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in
USD terms recovered within 5 years.

Sweden 1987–2000 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Sweden experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987 and 2000.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1987 and 1990, Sweden experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
growth, and strong housing returns. Debts rose by 15% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 239% of GDP.
In this case, the debt was in Sweden’s domestic currency,
and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were low but positive,
averaging around 2% of GDP, while Sweden maintained a
current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising
debt and capital, growth was moderate (at 2%), while levels
of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%).
During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large
tightening (with short rates rising around 500 bps).
Competitiveness became an issue, as Sweden’s real FX
peaked at +15%. Taken together, these bubble pressures,
combined with tightening money and credit, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1990 to
1993. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 65% of
GDP, making Sweden vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of housing price declines hitting bank solvency.
Sweden suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 6%), in stock prices (falling by 34%) and in home
prices (falling by 7%). Unemployment rates increased by 9%.
Sweden’s financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
even though Sweden needed a deleveraging, its debt as a %
GDP went up by 40% (12% annualized) as incomes declined
and as the government had to borrow more in response to
the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 10% of GDP during
the ugly period).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively short bust phase, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in
1993. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 5% of
GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 3%, and
real FX averaged -5% during the stimulative phase. Over the
cycle, Sweden was very aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy
levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity,
and directly purchased troubled assets. It also enacted
structural reforms designed to increase labor market
flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth
above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 5%
during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 4%).
During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 1% and
debt as a % of GDP fell by 28% (4% annualized), as shown in
the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this “beautiful”
period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly
from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It
took 3 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and
equity prices in USD terms recovered within 4 years.

Japan 1987–2017 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Japan experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1987 and 1989, Japan experienced a bubble that was
driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 24% of GDP
during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 307% of GDP. In this
case, the debt was in Japan’s domestic currency, the majority
was owned domestically, and Japan was a net creditor
(which helped keep the exchange rate strong even through
shocks, due to capital repatriations). During the bubble
phase, investment inflows were low, averaging around 1% of
GDP. Aided by that rising debt, growth was strong (at 5%),
while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap
peaked at 4%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities
averaged 28% annualized returns over the bubble period)
encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth.
During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large
tightening (with short rates rising around 450 bps). Taken
together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening
money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 1989 to
2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 78% of
GDP, making Japan vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of real estate and stock market busts. Japan
suffered from self-reinforcing declines in stock prices
(falling by 67%) and in home prices (falling by 43%).
Unemployment rates increased by 3%. Japan’s financial
institutions also came under considerable pressure. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though
Japan needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up
by 59% (3% annualized), driven primarily by interest
payments financed with new debt.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Japan 1987–2017 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
In this case, the resolution of the debt problems was very
slow, as monetary policy was not sufficiently easy to push
nominal GDP growth above nominal interest rates for quite
some time. Eventually, however, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began
in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 58%
of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%,
and real FX averaged -10% during the stimulative phase.
Over the cycle, Japan was very aggressive in managing its

enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor
market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal
growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth
averaging 2% during this period and sovereign long rates
falling to 0%). During this phase, unemployment rates were
flat and debt as a % of GDP fell by 43% (9% annualized), as
shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this
“beautiful” period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios
was driven primarily by monetization and to a lesser extent
by rising real incomes.

United States 2004–2014 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the United States
experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle
between 2004 and 2014.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2004 and 2007, the United States experienced a
bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising
debt, strong growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by
38% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 349% of
GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United States’s
domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically,
too. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were
moderately strong, averaging around 8% of GDP, which
helped to finance a current account deficit of 6% of GDP.
Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at
3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap
peaked at 3%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities
averaged 14% annualized returns over the bubble period)
encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth.
During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large
tightening (with short rates rising around 400 bps). Taken
together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening
money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2007 to
2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 68% of
GDP, making the United States vulnerable to a shock—which
came in the form of a housing bust. The United States
suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by
4%), in stock prices (falling by 50%) and in home prices
(falling by 28%). Unemployment rates increased by 5%. The
United States’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to
the right, even though the United States needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 23% (15% annualized),
driven primarily by interest payments financed with new
debt and to a lesser extent by falling real incomes.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

United States 2004–2014 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
After a slightly shorter than average bust phase, policy
makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the
deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of
reflation, which began in 2009. In terms of monetary policy,
M0 increased by 16% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately
pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -10% during the
stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United States was
very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and
bad debts, pulling 6 out of 9 classic policy levers. In
particular, it recapitalized banks, provided liquidity, and
directly purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped
bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates
(with growth averaging 3% during this period and sovereign
long rates falling to 2%). During this phase, unemployment
rates declined by 3% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 59%
(11% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the
right. Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real
incomes, inflation, and paying down existing debt. This was
partially offset by interest payments financed with new
debt. It took 4 years before real GDP reached its prior peak
and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 5 years.

As shown in the charts to the right, Austria experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Austria experienced a bubble that
was most characterized by strong equity returns. Debts rose
by 19% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of
279% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which,
while technically Austria’s domestic currency, is not a
currency that Austria had control over. In addition, a high
share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Austria
with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Aided
by that capital, growth was strong (at 3%). Furthermore,
strong asset returns (equities averaged 20% annualized
returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing
and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period,
policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short
rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these bubble
pressures and Austria’s dependence on foreign financing,
combined with tightening money and credit and the
weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 69% of
GDP, making Austria vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Austria suffered
from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%), and in
stock prices (falling by 66%). Austria’s financial institutions
also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the

As shown in the charts to the right, Germany experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2006 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Germany didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was
tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets
that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did
build up a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 261%
of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case, the debt was in
Euros, which, while technically Germany’s domestic
currency, is not a currency that Germany had control over.
Most of the debt was owned domestically.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 51% of
GDP, making Germany vulnerable to a shock—which came
in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Germany
suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by
7%), and in stock prices (falling by 53%). Germany’s
financial institutions also came under considerable pressure.

meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Greece experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 40% of GDP
during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 206% of GDP. In
this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically
Greece’s domestic currency, is not a currency that Greece
had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was
owned by foreigners, which left Greece with some exposure
to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were strong, averaging around 22% of
GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of
13% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth
was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were

The Reflation Phase
So far, Greece hasn’t transitioned into much of a “beautiful”
phase, as the nominal growth rate was never pushed above

As shown in the charts to the right, Hungary experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Hungary experienced a bubble
that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt,
strong equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 45%
of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 214% of
GDP. In this case, the debt was in Hungary’s domestic
currency, though a high share was owned by foreigners,
which left Hungary with some exposure to a pullback in
foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows
were moderately strong, averaging around 6% of GDP, which
helped to finance a current account deficit of 8% of GDP.
Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at
3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP
gap peaked at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset returns
(equities averaged 14% annualized returns over the bubble
period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate
growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Hungary’s dependence on foreign financing, combined with
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 31% of GDP,
making Hungary vulnerable to a shock—which came in the
form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Hungary suffered a
fall in foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 12%
of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short
rates by 5%)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines
in GDP (falling by 7%), in stock prices (falling by 73%) and in
home prices (falling by 16%). Unemployment rates increased
by 3%. Hungary’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to
the right, even though Hungary needed a deleveraging, its
debt as a % GDP went up by 37% (7% annualized) as
incomes declined and as the government had to borrow
more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of
5% of GDP during the ugly period).

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to
provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a
beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began
in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 4% of
GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and
real FX averaged -6% during the stimulative phase. Over the
cycle, Hungary was aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic policy
levers. It also benefited from an IMF assistance program.
This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above
nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 5% during
this period and sovereign long rates falling to 2%). During
this phase, unemployment rates declined by 7% and debt as
a % of GDP fell by 51% (12% annualized), as shown in the
attribution chart to the right. Throughout this “beautiful”
period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly
from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth.
It took 6 years before real GDP reached its prior peak, but
equity prices in USD terms haven’t yet fully recovered.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Hungary,
as it helped set the stage for Viktor Orban, whom many
people consider a populist leader, to take power.

Ireland 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Ireland experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Ireland experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
growth, and strong housing returns. Debts rose by 94% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 271% of GDP.
In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically
Ireland’s domestic currency, is not a currency that Ireland
had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was
owned by foreigners, which left Ireland with some exposure
to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were strong, averaging around 95% of
GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of
5% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth
was strong (at 5%), while levels of economic activity were
high (the GDP gap peaked at 8%). Furthermore, moderate
asset returns (equities averaged 5% annualized returns over
the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped
to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy
makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates
rising around 220 bps). Competitiveness became an issue, as
Ireland’s real FX peaked at +17%. Taken together, these
bubble pressures and Ireland’s dependence on foreign
financing, combined with tightening money and credit and
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 77% of
GDP, making Ireland vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of the European debt crisis. Ireland suffered from
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 9%), in stock
prices (falling by 73%) and in home prices (falling by 53%).
Unemployment rates increased by 9%. Ireland’s financial
institutions also came under considerable pressure. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though
Ireland needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up
by 35% (7% annualized), driven primarily by interest
payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by
deflation. This was partially offset by defaults.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, ECB policy makers were
able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging
into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which
began in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by
14% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to
0%, and real FX averaged -19% during the stimulative
phase. Over the cycle, Ireland was very aggressive in
managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 7
out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized
banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled
assets. It also benefited from an IMF assistance program
and enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor
market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal
growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth
averaging 6% during this period and sovereign long rates
falling to 0%). During this phase, unemployment rates
declined by 8% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 116% (25%
annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right.
Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real
incomes and paying down existing debt. It took 6 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak, but equity prices in
USD terms haven’t yet fully recovered.

As shown in the charts to the right, Italy experienced a classic
deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Italy experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt and
strong growth. Debts rose by 29% of GDP during the bubble
to a pre-crisis peak of 270% of GDP. In this case, the debt
was in Euros, which, while technically Italy’s domestic
currency, is not a currency that Italy had control over. In
addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners,
which left Italy with some exposure to a pullback in foreign
capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were
moderately strong, averaging around 7% of GDP, which
helped to finance a current account deficit of 1% of GDP.
Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was moderate
(at 2%), while levels of economic activity were high (the
GDP gap peaked at 4%). Furthermore, strong asset returns
(equities averaged 7% annualized returns over the bubble
period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate
growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a
moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 200
bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and Italy’s
dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening
money and credit and the weakened conditions of related
countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2015. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 58% of
GDP, making Italy vulnerable to a shock—which came in the
form of the European debt crisis. Italy suffered a fall in
foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 14% of
GDP)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 9%), in stock prices (falling by 67%) and in home
prices (falling by 15%). Unemployment rates increased by
6%. Italy’s financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
even though Italy needed a deleveraging, its debt as a %
GDP went up by 48% (7% annualized), driven primarily by
interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser
extent by falling real incomes.

The Reflation Phase
After a relatively long bust phase, ECB policy makers were
able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging
into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which
began in 2015. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by
16% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to
0%, and real FX averaged -1% during the stimulative phase.
Over the cycle, Italy was aggressive in managing its
financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic
policy levers. It also enacted structural reforms designed to
increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped
bring nominal growth above nominal interest rates (with
growth averaging 1.8% during this period and sovereign
long rates falling to 1.2%). During this phase, unemployment
rates declined by 1% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 36% (14%
annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right.
Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of monetization
and paying down existing debt. Real GDP has not yet
reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms
haven’t yet fully recovered.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Italy, as it
helped set the stage for Giuseppe Conte, whom many people
consider a populist leader, to take power in 2018.

Netherlands 2006–2017 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the Netherlands
experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle
between 2006 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2006 and 2008, the Netherlands experienced a
bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising
debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by
10% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 355% of
GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while
technically the Netherlands’s domestic currency, is not a
currency that the Netherlands had control over. In addition, a
high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left the
Netherlands with some exposure to a pullback in foreign
capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were
strong, averaging around 14% of GDP. Aided by that rising
debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 11%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more
borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble
period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with
short rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these
bubble pressures and the Netherlands’s dependence on foreign
financing, combined with tightening money and credit and
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2014. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 68% of
GDP, making the Netherlands vulnerable to a shock—which
came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. The
Netherlands suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP

Portugal 2007–2017 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Portugal experienced a
classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2007 and 2017.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2007 and 2008, Portugal experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 36% of GDP
during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 273% of GDP. In this
case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically
Portugal’s domestic currency, is not a currency that Portugal
had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned
by foreigners, which left Portugal with some exposure to a
pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were strong, averaging around 10% of
GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of
11% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth
was moderate (at 2%), while levels of economic activity were
high (the GDP gap peaked at 3%). Furthermore, strong asset
returns (equities averaged 16% annualized returns over the
bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to
stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers
initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising
around 220 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Portugal’s dependence on foreign financing, combined with
tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of
related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 48% of
GDP, making Portugal vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of the European debt crisis. Portugal suffered a fall
in foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 40% of
GDP)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 10%), in stock prices (falling by 65%) and in home
prices (falling by 18%). Unemployment rates increased by
9%. Portugal’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to
the right, even though Portugal needed a deleveraging, its
debt as a % GDP went up by 105% (21% annualized), driven
by a mix of falling real incomes, interest payments financed
with new debt, and net new borrowing. Those new debts
came in part because the government had to borrow more in
response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 8% of
GDP during the ugly period).

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Spain experienced a bubble that

As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom
experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle
between 2005 and 2015.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, the United Kingdom experienced a
bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising
debt and strong growth. Debts rose by 89% of GDP during
the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 437% of GDP. In this case,
the debt was in the United Kingdom’s domestic currency,
and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging
around 14% of GDP, which helped to finance a current
account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and
capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%). Furthermore,
strong asset returns (equities averaged 8% annualized
returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing
and helped to stimulate growth. Taken together, these
bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and
credit and the weakened conditions of related countries,
created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and an “ugly deleveraging,” which ran from 2008 to
2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 82% of
GDP, making the United Kingdom vulnerable to a shock—
which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The United Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines
in GDP (falling by 6%), in stock prices (falling by 52%) and
in home prices (falling by 19%). Unemployment rates
increased by 3%. The United Kingdom’s financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in
the attribution chart to the right, even though the United
Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went
up by 34% (24% annualized), driven primarily by interest
payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by
falling real incomes.

The Reflation Phase
After a slightly shorter than average bust phase, policy
makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the
deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of
reflation, which began in 2009. In terms of monetary policy,
M0 increased by 10% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately
pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -5% during the
stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United Kingdom was
very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and

rates declined by 2% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 73%
(12% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the
right. Throughout this “beautiful” period, the reduction in
debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real
incomes and inflation. This was partially offset by interest
payments financed with new debt. It took 5 years before

Germany 1918–1925 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Germany experienced a
classic wartime hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle
between 1918 and 1925. As is typical for losers of big wars,
Germany experienced a prolonged postwar depression
(given widespread damage to its industrial base), and a more
painful deleveraging.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The War Phase
Unlike the typical case that entails a bubble, this debt crisis
had its roots in WW1. During the war, Germany borrowed a
lot of money to finance its big fiscal deficit, shifted much of
its economy to war production, and shifted much of its
workforce to the armed services and war production. For
these reasons, the economic stats are not reflective of
typical economic linkages. Through the war, debts rose to
158% of GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (64% of GDP). Hampered by wartime
losses, growth was weak through this period (at -6%).

The Post-War Phase
When the fighting ended, Germany entered a postwar
depression and balance of payments crisis, which ran from
1918 to 1923. Since Germany lost the war and was saddled
with very large foreign currency debts, its post-war depression was far worse than it was for the winners. Germany
suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by
5%), and in stock prices (falling by 97%). Unemployment
rates increased by 16%. Germany’s financial institutions also
came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Germany needed a
deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 165% (31%
annualized) as incomes declined and as the government
continued to shoulder war-related costs (with a peak fiscal
deficit of 11% of GDP during the ugly period).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 99

Germany 1918–1925 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they allow a tightening of financial
conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary
to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money
leaving (which can be inflationary). In this case, the
tightening wasn’t enough to produce the needed adjustments before the country fell into a spiral of declining
exchange rates and hyperinflation. Inflation peaked at over
10,000%. That makes sense given that Germany had most of
the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation spirals (with
the biggest risk factor being their fiscal deficit). Germany
was aggressive in managing its financial institutions and
bad debts, pulling 5 out of 9 typical policy levers. But, as is
classic, stopping the inflationary spiral ultimately required
Germany to make more significant structural changes,
including abandoning the hyperinflated papiermark and
adopting the reichsmark in 1924. It took 15 years before real
GDP reached its prior peak.

Argentina 1977–1988 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Argentina experienced a
classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle between 1977
and 1988.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1977 and 1980, Argentina experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
equity returns, and strong growth. By the bubble’s end,
debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 39% of GDP. In this
case, a high share of the debt was in foreign currencies (15%
of GDP)—leaving Argentina with a large exposure to a
pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were low but positive, averaging around
2% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth
was moderate (at 2%), while levels of economic activity were
high (the GDP gap peaked at 8%). Furthermore, strong asset
returns (equities averaged 52% annualized returns over the
bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to
stimulate growth. Competitiveness became an issue, as
Argentina’s real FX peaked at +70%. Taken together, these
bubble pressures and Argentina’s dependence on foreign
financing, combined with the weakened conditions of
related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1980 to 1985. High debt levels left Argentina vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 1980s Latin
American Debt Crisis. Argentina suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 9% of GDP), leading
to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by more
than 250%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real
FX fell by 93%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing
declines in GDP (falling by 14%), and in stock prices (falling
by 91%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%, while
currency weakness contributed to very high and rising
inflation. Argentina’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 83%), though it eventually abandoned its
currency defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though Argentina needed a deleveraging, its debt
as a % GDP went up by 33% (7% annualized), in part
because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the
government had to borrow more in response to the crisis
(with a peak fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP).

the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Argentina 1977–1988 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they allow a tightening of financial
conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary
to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money
leaving (which can be inflationary). In this case, the
tightening wasn’t enough to produce the needed adjustments before the country fell into a spiral of declining
exchange rates and hyperinflation. Real FX bottomed at
-138% and inflation peaked at over 1,000%. That makes
sense given that Argentina had around half of the classic
“risk factors” for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest
risk factor being low real short rates). Argentina was
somewhat aggressive in managing its financial institutions
and bad debts, pulling 3 out of 9 typical policy levers. In
particular, it nationalized banks and provided liquidity. It
also benefited from an IMF assistance program. But, as is
classic, stopping the inflationary spiral ultimately required
Argentina to make more significant structural changes,
including abandoning the hyperinflated peso ley and
adopting the peso argentino in 1983. It took 7 years before
real GDP reached its prior peak.

Brazil 1977–1987 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Brazil experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1977 and 1987.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Brazil didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was
tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets
that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did
build up a substantial debt stock driven by unsustainably
strong capital inflows, with debts reaching 158% of GDP
prior to the crisis. In this case, a high share of the debt was
in foreign currencies (70% of GDP)—leaving Brazil with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Brazil also
became somewhat dependent on continuous foreign
financing, running a current account deficit of 5% of GDP
(with investment inflows averaging 6% of GDP in the years
before the crisis). Ultimately, these high debts and Brazil’s
dependence on foreign financing, combined with the
weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1980 to 1983. High debt levels left Brazil vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of the 1980s Latin American
Debt Crisis. Brazil suffered a fall in foreign funding (with
capital inflows falling by 5% of GDP), leading to a tightening
(policy makers hiked short rates by 234%) and a meaningful
decline in the currency (real FX fell by 20%)—which
coincided with self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by
6%), and in stock prices (falling by 51%). In addition,
currency weakness contributed to very high and rising
inflation, peaking at 124% during the depression phase,
which is high compared to other similar cases. That makes
sense given that Brazil had most of the classic “risk factors”
for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being
low real short rates). Brazil’s financial institutions also came
under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank
spent down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing
down reserves by 70%), though it eventually abandoned its
currency defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though Brazil needed a deleveraging, its debt as a
% GDP went up by 54% (18% annualized), in part because
the currency fell (which increased the burden of foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the government had to
borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal
deficit of 11% of GDP).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow
a tightening of financial conditions to flow through
(painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or
print money to make up for money leaving (which can be
inflationary). In this case, they abandoned the currency peg
and, after a slightly longer than average “ugly” phase,
policy makers allowed enough tightening to flow through
to reduce spending on imports (the current account balance
improved by 3% of GDP), and make the currency more
attractive to hold. Brazil was aggressive in managing its
financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9
classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks and
provided liquidity. It also benefited from an IMF assistance
program. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
debt as a % of GDP fell by 121% (27% annualized) over the
course of this adjustment period. The reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from nominal income
rising. Meanwhile, Brazil’s now lower currency (with real
FX bottoming at -33% during the beautiful period) set up
the country for renewed competitiveness. It took 4 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in
USD terms recovered within 1.9 years.

Chile 1978–1995 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Chile experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1978 and 1995.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1978 and 1981, Chile experienced a bubble that was
driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong
growth. Debts rose by 86% of GDP during the bubble to a
pre-crisis peak of 145% of GDP. In this case, a high share of
the debt was in foreign currencies (32% of GDP)—leaving
Chile with a large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital.
During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong,
averaging around 14% of GDP, which helped to finance a
current account deficit of 11% of GDP. Aided by that rising
debt and capital, growth was strong (at 7%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 11%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 36%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more
borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Competitiveness
became an issue, as Chile’s real FX peaked at +36%. Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Chile’s dependence on
foreign financing, combined with the weakened conditions of
related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1981 to 1985. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached
45% of GDP, making Chile vulnerable to a shock—which
came in the form of the 1980s Latin American Debt Crisis.
Chile suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital inflows
falling by 40% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy
makers hiked short rates by 31%) and a meaningful decline in
the currency (real FX fell by 50%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 14%), and in stock
prices (falling by 74%). In addition, currency weakness
contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking at 33%
during the depression phase, which is normal compared to
other similar cases. That’s true despite the fact that Chile
had most of the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation
spirals (with the biggest risk factor being a long history of
poorly-controlled inflation). Chile’s financial institutions also
came under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central
bank spent down its reserves to defend the currency
(drawing down reserves by 53%), though it eventually
abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the attribution
chart to the right, even though Chile needed a deleveraging,
its debt as a % GDP went up by 73% (19% annualized), in part
because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the
government had to borrow more in response to the crisis
(with a peak fiscal deficit of 4% of GDP).

Mexico 1979–1991 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Mexico experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1979 and 1991.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1979 and 1981, Mexico experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt and strong growth. By the
bubble’s end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 65% of
GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was in foreign
currencies (26% of GDP)—leaving Mexico with a large
exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble
phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 8%
of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of
6% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was
strong (at 9%), while levels of economic activity were high
(the GDP gap peaked at 9%). Competitiveness became an
issue, as Mexico’s real FX peaked at +30%. Taken together,
these bubble pressures and Mexico’s dependence on foreign
financing, combined with the weakened conditions of related
countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1981 to 1987. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached
31% of GDP, making Mexico vulnerable to a shock—which
came in the form of the 1980s Latin American Debt Crisis
and falling oil prices. Mexico suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 17% of GDP), leading
to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by 128%) and
a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell by
74%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 7%), and in stock prices (falling by 86%). In
addition, currency weakness contributed to very high and
rising inflation, peaking at 151% during the depression phase,
which is high compared to other similar cases. That makes
sense given that Mexico had most of the classic “risk factors”
for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being
their fiscal deficit). Mexico’s financial institutions also came

Peru 1980–1986 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Peru experienced a classic
inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1980 and 1986.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Peru didn’t experience a broadbased bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was tied to
other countries, economies, and financial markets that were
experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did build up a
substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 107% of GDP prior
to the crisis. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (106% of GDP)—leaving Peru with a large
exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Peru also became
somewhat dependent on continuous foreign financing,
running a current account deficit of 4%. Ultimately, these
high debts and Peru’s dependence on foreign financing,
combined with the weakened conditions of related countries,
created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1982 to 1985. High debt levels left Peru vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of the 1980s Latin American
Debt Crisis. Peru suffered from self-reinforcing declines in
GDP (falling by 13%), and in stock prices (falling by 56%).
Unemployment rates increased by 5%, while currency
weakness contributed to very high and rising inflation,
peaking at 190% during the depression phase, which is high
compared to other similar cases. That makes sense given
that Peru had most of the classic “risk factors” for bigger
inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being low real
short rates). Peru’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 44%), though by the end policy makers had
abandoned their currency defense and the currency had
fallen by 53%. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
even though Peru needed a deleveraging, its debt as a %
GDP went up by 163% (42% annualized), in part because the
currency fell (which increased the burden of foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the government had
to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal
deficit of 5% of GDP).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Philippines 1979–1992 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the Philippines experienced a transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between
1979 and 1992. This is also a classic example of a country
“letting its currency go” in the face of external pressures,
which produces some temporary inflation but ultimately
gives policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1979 and 1982, the Philippines experienced a
bubble that was most characterized by unsustainably strong
capital inflows and strong currency returns. Debts rose by
16% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 77% of
GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was in foreign
currencies (56% of GDP)—leaving the Philippines with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging
around 9% of GDP, which helped to finance a current
account deficit of 7% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and
capital, growth was strong (at 4%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 9%).
Competitiveness became an issue, as the Philippines’s real
FX peaked at +18%. Taken together, these bubble pressures
and the Philippines’s dependence on foreign financing
created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1982 to 1984. High debt levels left the Philippines
vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of rapidly
declining commodity prices and political violence. The
Philippines suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital
inflows falling by 9% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy
makers hiked short rates by 34%) and a meaningful decline
in the currency (real FX fell by 16%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 11%), and in stock
prices (falling by 71%). In addition, currency weakness
contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking at 58%
during the depression phase, which is normal compared to
other similar cases. That makes sense given that the

Meanwhile, the central bank spent down its reserves to
defend the currency (drawing down reserves by 100%),
though it eventually abandoned its currency defense. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the
Philippines needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was
roughly flat through this period.

Malaysia 1981–1990 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Malaysia experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1981 and
1990. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1981 and 1984, Malaysia experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably
strong capital inflows, rising debt and strong growth. Debts
rose by 40% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of
153% of GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (42% of GDP)—leaving Malaysia with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging
around 14% of GDP, which helped to finance a current
account deficit of 10% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and
capital, growth was strong (at 7%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 3%).
Competitiveness became an issue, as Malaysia’s real FX
peaked at +20%. Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Malaysia’s dependence on foreign financing, combined with
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1984 to 1987. High debt levels left Malaysia vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of commodity price
declines hitting exports. Malaysia suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 11% of GDP), leading
to a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell by
19%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in
stock prices (falling by 56%). Unemployment rates increased
by 2%. Malaysia’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down

currency defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though Malaysia needed a deleveraging, its debt
as a % GDP went up by 43% (17% annualized), in part
because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the
government had to borrow more in response to the crisis
(with a peak fiscal deficit of 10% of GDP).

The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow a
tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful
but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money
to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary). In
this case, they abandoned the currency peg and, after a
slightly shorter than average “ugly” phase, policy makers
allowed enough tightening to flow through to reduce
spending on imports (the current account balance improved
by 9% of GDP), and make the currency more attractive to
hold. Malaysia was aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 5 out of 9 classic policy
levers. In particular, it nationalized banks and provided
liquidity. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, debt
as a % of GDP fell by 74% (21% annualized) over the course of
this adjustment period. The reduction in debt-to-income
ratios came mostly from nominal income rising, driven
primarily by higher real growth. Meanwhile, Malaysia’s now
lower currency (with real FX bottoming at -12% during the
beautiful period) set up the country for renewed competitiveness. It took 1.8 years before real GDP reached its prior peak
and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 6 years.

Peru 1986–1995 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Peru experienced a
classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle between 1986
and 1995.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1986 and 1987, Peru experienced a bubble that was
driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 55% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 184% of GDP.
In this case, a high share of the debt was in foreign
currencies (182% of GDP)—leaving Peru with a large
exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Peru maintained a
current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising
debt, growth was strong (at 5%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 11%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 124%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged
more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Peru’s dependence on
foreign financing created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which
ran from 1987 to 1990. High debt levels left Peru vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of Peru’s leadership not
being willing to cooperate with international creditors.
Peru suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling
by 30%), and in stock prices (falling by 91%). Peru’s
financial institutions also came under considerable
pressure. Though it was caught in an ugly deleveraging,
Peru nevertheless managed to reduce its debt as a %GDP by
106% (30% annualized) through this period (as shown in
the attribution chart to the right). The reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising,
driven primarily by higher inflation.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

tightening wasn’t enough to produce the needed adjustments before the country fell into a spiral of declining
exchange rates and hyperinflation. Real FX bottomed at
-115% and inflation peaked at over 10,000%. That makes
sense given that Peru had most of the classic “risk factors”
for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being
low real short rates). Peru was somewhat aggressive in
managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 3
out of 9 typical policy levers. In particular, it nationalized
banks and provided liquidity. It also enacted structural
reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. But, as
is classic, stopping the inflationary spiral ultimately
required Peru to make more significant structural changes,
including abandoning the hyperinflated inti and adopting
the sol in 1991. It took 9 years before real GDP reached its
prior peak.

Argentina 1987–1993 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Argentina experienced a
classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987
and 1993.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Argentina didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was
tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets
that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did
build up a substantial debt stock, with debts rising by 15% of
GDP to a pre-crisis peak of 70% of GDP during a period of
leveraging up. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (39% of GDP)—leaving Argentina with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Ultimately,
these high debts, combined with structural weaknesses in
the economy, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1987 to 1990. High debt levels left Argentina vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of commodity price
declines hitting exports. Argentina suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 4% of GDP), leading
to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by more
than 250%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real
FX fell by 60%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing
declines in GDP (falling by 16%), and in stock prices (falling
by 33%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%, while
currency weakness contributed to very high and rising
inflation. Argentina’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 26%), though it eventually abandoned its
currency defense. Though it was caught in an ugly deleveraging, Argentina nevertheless managed to reduce its debt as
a %GDP by 30% (11% annualized) through this period (as
shown in the attribution chart to the right). The reduction
in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising,
driven primarily by higher inflation.

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of

including abandoning the hyperinflated austral and
adopting the current Argentine peso, which was initially
pegged to the US dollar. It took 4 years before real GDP
reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms
recovered within 2 years.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Argentina,
as it helped set the stage for Carlos Menem, whom many
people consider a populist leader, to take power.

Brazil 1987–1995 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Brazil experienced a
classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987
and 1995.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1987 and 1990, Brazil experienced a bubble that was
driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong equity
returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 69% of GDP
during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 177% of GDP. In this
case, a high share of the debt was in foreign currencies (26%
of GDP)—leaving Brazil with a large exposure to a pullback
in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment
inflows were low, averaging around -3% of GDP. Aided by
that rising debt, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 7%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 16%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more
borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Competitiveness
became an issue, as Brazil’s real FX peaked at +35%. Taken
together, these bubble pressures, combined with the
weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1990 to 1991. High debt levels left Brazil vulnerable to
a shock—which came in the form of a collapse of price
control regulations and an inflation shock. Brazil suffered
from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 7%), and in
stock prices (falling by 70%). Unemployment rates increased
by 4%, while currency weakness contributed to very high
inflation. Brazil’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 28%), though by the end policy makers had
abandoned their currency defense and the currency had
fallen by 19%. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
even though Brazil needed a deleveraging, its debt as a %
GDP went up by 40% (37% annualized), in part because the
currency fell (which increased the burden of foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the government had
to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal
deficit of 19% of GDP).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Turkey 1990–1995 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Turkey experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1990 and 1995.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Turkey didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it did
build up a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 41%
of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case, a high share of the
debt was in foreign currencies (26% of GDP)—leaving
Turkey with a large exposure to a pullback in foreign
capital. Turkey also became somewhat dependent on
continuous foreign financing, with investment inflows
averaging 2% in the years before the crisis. Ultimately,
these high debts and Turkey’s dependence on foreign
financing created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1993 to 1994. High debt levels left Turkey vulnerable to
a shock—which came in the form of moves by the government to undermine central bank independence. Turkey
suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital inflows
falling by 8% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers
hiked short rates by 203%) and a meaningful decline in the
currency (real FX fell by 26%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 12%), and in
stock prices (falling by 70%). In addition, currency weakness
contributed to very high and rising inflation, peaking at
117% during the depression phase, which is high compared
to other similar cases. That’s true despite the fact that
Turkey had only about a quarter of the classic “risk factors”
for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being
a long history of poorly-controlled inflation). Turkey’s
financial institutions also came under considerable pressure.
Meanwhile, the central bank spent down its reserves to
defend the currency (drawing down reserves by 99%),
though it eventually abandoned its currency defense. As
shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though
Turkey needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up
by 9% (17% annualized), in part because the currency fell
(which increased the burden of foreign-denominated debt).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

As shown in the charts to the right, Mexico experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1991 and 2005.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1991 and 1994, Mexico experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably
strong capital inflows, rising debt, strong equity returns,
and strong growth. Debts rose by 10% of GDP during the
bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 85% of GDP. In this case, a
high share of the debt was in foreign currencies (25% of
GDP)—leaving Mexico with a large exposure to a pullback in
foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows
were strong, averaging around 8% of GDP, which helped to
finance a current account deficit of 7% of GDP. Aided by
that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 4%),
while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap
peaked at 3%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities
averaged 25% annualized returns over the bubble period)
encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate
growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Mexico’s dependence on foreign financing created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1994 to 1995. High debt levels left Mexico vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of an outbreak of
political violence. Mexico suffered from self-reinforcing
declines in GDP (falling by 10%), and in stock prices (falling
by 66%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%, while
currency weakness contributed to high and rising inflation,
peaking at 43% during the depression phase, which is
normal compared to other similar cases. That makes sense
given that Mexico had around half of the classic “risk
factors” for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk
factor being a long history of poorly-controlled inflation).
Mexico’s financial institutions also came under considerable

roughly flat through this period.

and 2003.

over-indebted companies/banks. Bulgaria suffered a fall in
foreign funding (with capital inflows falling by 6% of GDP),
leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by
228%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX
fell by 96%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines

Thailand 1993–2004 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Thailand experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1993 and
2004. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1993 and 1996, Thailand experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong
growth. Debts rose by 44% of GDP during the bubble to a
pre-crisis peak of 183% of GDP. In this case, a high share of
the debt was in foreign currencies (51% of GDP)—leaving
Thailand with a large exposure to a pullback in foreign
capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were
strong, averaging around 15% of GDP, which helped to
finance a current account deficit of 9% of GDP. Aided by that
rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 8%), while
levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at
8%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged
12% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged
more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Thailand’s dependence
on foreign financing created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which
ran from 1996 to 1998. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service
reached 49% of GDP, making Thailand vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of a wave of losses from
over-indebted companies/banks. Thailand suffered a fall in
foreign funding (with capital inflows falling by 34% of
GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short
rates by 11%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real
FX fell by 19%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing
declines in GDP (falling by 14%), and in stock prices (falling
by 87%). In addition, currency weakness contributed to
moderate and rising inflation, peaking at 8% during the
depression phase, which is low compared to other similar
cases. That makes sense given that Thailand had only about
a quarter of the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation
spirals (with the biggest risk factor being their current
account deficit). Thailand’s financial institutions also came
under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank
spent down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing
down reserves by 100%), though it eventually abandoned its
currency defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though Thailand needed a deleveraging, its debt
as a % GDP went up by 36% (18% annualized), in part
because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debt).
*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

slightly shorter than average “ugly” phase, policy makers
allowed enough tightening to flow through to reduce
spending on imports (the current account balance improved
by 21% of GDP), and make the currency more attractive to
hold. Thailand was very aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 8 out of 9 classic policy
levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided
liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. It also
benefited from an IMF assistance program. As shown in the
attribution chart to the right, debt as a % of GDP fell by 88%
(15% annualized) over the course of this adjustment period.
The reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from
nominal income rising, driven primarily by higher real
growth. Meanwhile, Thailand’s now lower currency (with
real FX bottoming at -16% during the beautiful period) set
up the country for renewed competitiveness. It took 5 years
before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in
USD terms recovered within 23 years.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Thailand, as
it helped set the stage for Thaksin Shinawatra, whom many
people consider a populist leader, to take power in 2001.

Indonesia 1994–2012 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Indonesia experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1994 and
2012. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1994 and 1997, Indonesia experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong
growth. By the bubble’s end, debts had reached a pre-crisis
peak of 104% of GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was
in foreign currencies (51% of GDP)—leaving Indonesia with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the
bubble phase, investment inflows were low but positive,
averaging around 5% of GDP, while Indonesia maintained a
current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt
and capital, growth was strong (at 7%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 13%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 12%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more
borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Competitiveness
became an issue, as Indonesia’s real FX peaked at +19%. Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Indonesia’s dependence
on foreign financing, combined with the weakened conditions
of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1997 to 1998. High debt levels left Indonesia vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of the 1997 Asian financial
crisis. Indonesia suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital
inflows falling by 13% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy
makers hiked short rates by 43%) and a meaningful decline in
the currency (real FX fell by 110%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 14%), and in stock
prices (falling by 89%). In addition, currency weakness
contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking at 59% during
the depression phase, which is normal compared to other
similar cases. That’s true despite the fact that Indonesia had
only about a quarter of the classic “risk factors” for bigger
inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being high
foreign-denominated debts). Indonesia’s financial institutions
also came under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the
central bank spent down its reserves to defend the currency
(drawing down reserves by 23%), though it eventually
abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the attribution
chart to the right, even though Indonesia needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 132% (132% annualized),
in part because the currency fell (which increased the burden
of foreign-denominated debt).

the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow a
tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful
but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money
to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary). In
this case, they abandoned the currency peg and, after a
relatively short “ugly” phase, policy makers allowed enough
tightening to flow through to reduce spending on imports
(the current account balance improved by 4% of GDP), and
make the currency more attractive to hold. Indonesia was
very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and
bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly
purchased troubled assets. It also benefited from an IMF
assistance program. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, debt as a % of GDP fell by 178% (13% annualized) over
the course of this adjustment period. The reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from nominal income
rising. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s now much lower currency
(with real FX bottoming at -90% during the beautiful period)
set up the country for renewed competitiveness. It took 5
years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity
prices in USD terms recovered within 13 years.

As shown in the charts to the right, Korea experienced a

produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives

The Bubble Phase
Between 1994 and 1997, Korea experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably
strong capital inflows, rising debt and strong growth. Debts
rose by 23% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of
163% of GDP. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (27% of GDP)—leaving Korea with a large
exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble
phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 8% of GDP, which helped to finance a current
account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and
capital, growth was strong (at 8%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%). Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Korea’s dependence on
foreign financing, combined with the weakened conditions
of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1997 to 1998. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service
reached 42% of GDP, making Korea vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of the 1997 Asian financial
crisis. Korea suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital
inflows falling by 9% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy
makers hiked short rates by 14%) and a meaningful decline
in the currency (real FX fell to -50%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 8%), in stock
prices (falling by 75%) and in home prices (falling by 13%).
Unemployment rates increased by 6%, while currency
weakness contributed to moderate inflation, peaking at 7%
during the depression phase, which is low compared to
other similar cases. That makes sense given that Korea had
only about a quarter of the classic “risk factors” for bigger
inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being low
central bank reserves). Korea’s financial institutions also
came under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central
bank spent down its reserves to defend the currency

Philippines 1994–2008 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, the Philippines experienced a transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between
1994 and 2008. This is also a classic example of a country
“letting its currency go” in the face of external pressures,
which produces some temporary inflation but ultimately
gives policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1994 and 1997, the Philippines experienced a bubble
that was most characterized by unsustainably strong capital
inflows and strong currency returns. Debts rose by 12% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 95% of GDP. In
this case, a high share of the debt was in foreign currencies
(51% of GDP)—leaving the Philippines with a large exposure
to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were strong, averaging around 12% of
GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 5%
of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was
strong (at 5%), while levels of economic activity were
moderate (the GDP gap peaked at 2%). Furthermore, strong

Russia 1996–2006 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Russia experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1996 and
2006. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Russia didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was
tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets
that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did
build up a substantial debt stock driven by unsustainably
strong capital inflows, with debts reaching 112% of GDP
prior to the crisis. In this case, a high share of the debt was
in foreign currencies (38% of GDP)—leaving Russia with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Russia also
became somewhat dependent on continuous foreign
financing, with investment inflows averaging 5% in the
years before the crisis. Ultimately, these high debts and
Russia’s dependence on foreign financing, combined with
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust
and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran from
1997 to 1998. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 90%
of GDP, making Russia vulnerable to a shock—which came in
the form of ripples from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and
falling oil prices. Russia suffered a fall in foreign funding
(with capital inflows falling by 5% of GDP), leading to a
tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by more than
250%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell
by 72%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in
GDP (falling by 10%), and in stock prices (falling by 85%). In
addition, currency weakness contributed to high and rising
inflation, peaking at 91% during the depression phase, which
is high compared to other similar cases. That makes sense
given that Russia had around half of the classic “risk factors”
for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being a
long history of poorly-controlled inflation). Russia’s financial
institutions also came under considerable pressure.
Meanwhile, the central bank spent down its reserves to
defend the currency (drawing down reserves by 55%), though
it eventually abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the
attribution chart to the right, even though Russia needed a
deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 63% (58%
annualized), in part because the currency fell (which
increased the burden of foreign-denominated debts) and in
part because the government had to borrow more in response
to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Colombia 1995–2008 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Colombia experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1995 and
2008. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1995 and 1998, Colombia experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt, strong growth, and strong housing
returns. Debts rose by 11% of GDP during the bubble to a
pre-crisis peak of 58% of GDP. In this case, a high share of the
debt was in foreign currencies (30% of GDP)—leaving
Colombia with a large exposure to a pullback in foreign
capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were
moderately strong, averaging around 8% of GDP, which helped
to finance a current account deficit of 5% of GDP. Aided by
that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while
levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at
5%). Competitiveness became an issue, as Colombia’s real FX
peaked at +16%. Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Colombia’s dependence on foreign financing, combined with
the weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1998 to 2003. High debt levels left Colombia vulnerable to
a shock—which came in the form of the effects of the 1997
Asian financial crisis. Colombia suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 8% of GDP), leading to
a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by 20%) and a
meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell by 45%)—
which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling
by 7%), and in stock prices (falling by 66%). Unemployment
rates increased by 6%, while currency weakness contributed to
moderate inflation, peaking at 20% during the depression
phase, which is low compared to other similar cases. That’s
true despite the fact that Colombia had around half of the
classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation spirals (with the
biggest risk factor being a long history of poorly-controlled
inflation). Colombia’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 37%), though it eventually abandoned its currency
defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even
though Colombia needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP
went up by 12% (2% annualized), in part because the currency
fell (which increased the burden of foreign-denominated debts)
and in part because the government had to borrow more in
response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP).
*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

course of this adjustment period. The reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from nominal income
rising. Meanwhile, Colombia’s now much lower currency
(with real FX bottoming at -29% during the beautiful
period) set up the country for renewed competitiveness. It
took 4 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and
equity prices in USD terms recovered within 7 years.

Ecuador 1995–2009 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Ecuador experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1995 and 2009.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Unlike many other cases, Ecuador didn’t experience a
broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was
tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets that
were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did build up
a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 85% of GDP
prior to the crisis. In this case, a high share of the debt was in
foreign currencies (56% of GDP)—leaving Ecuador with a
large exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Ecuador also
became somewhat dependent on continuous foreign financing, running a current account deficit of 4% of GDP (with
investment inflows averaging 3% of GDP in the years before
the crisis). Ultimately, these high debts and Ecuador’s
dependence on foreign financing, combined with the
weakened conditions of related countries, created an
unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 1998 to 2000. High debt levels left Ecuador vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of contagion from the
1997 Asian financial crisis. Ecuador suffered a fall in foreign
funding (with capital inflows falling by 11% of GDP), leading
to a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell by
60%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in
GDP (falling by 6%), and in stock prices (falling by 62%).
Unemployment rates increased by 2%, while currency
weakness contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking
at 76% during the depression phase, which is high compared
to other similar cases. That makes sense given that Ecuador
had most of the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation
spirals (with the biggest risk factor being low real short
rates). Ecuador’s financial institutions also came under
considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent
down its reserves to defend the currency (drawing down
reserves by 61%), though it eventually abandoned its
currency defense. As shown in the attribution chart to the
right, even though Ecuador needed a deleveraging, its debt
as a % GDP went up by 46% (42% annualized), in part
because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debt).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Ecuador 1995–2009 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)
The Reflation Phase
A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency
crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse
capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow
a tightening of financial conditions to flow through
(painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or
print money to make up for money leaving (which can be
inflationary). In this case, they abandoned the currency peg
and, after a relatively short “ugly” phase, policy makers
allowed enough tightening to flow through to reduce
spending on imports (the current account balance improved
by 11% of GDP), and make the currency more attractive to
hold. Ecuador was very aggressive in managing its financial
institutions and bad debts, pulling 9 out of 9 classic policy
levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided
liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. It also
benefited from an IMF assistance program and enacted
structural reforms designed to increase labor market
flexibility. As shown in the attribution chart to the right,
debt as a % of GDP fell by 79% (8% annualized) over the
course of this adjustment period. The reduction in
debt-to-income ratios came mostly from nominal income
rising. Meanwhile, Ecuador’s now much lower currency
(with real FX bottoming at -55% during the beautiful
period) set up the country for renewed competitiveness. It
took 1.8 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and
equity prices in USD terms recovered within 5 years.
The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Ecuador,
as it helped set the stage for Lucio Gutierrez, whom many
people consider a populist leader, to take power in 2003.

Turkey 1997–2003 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Turkey experienced a
classic inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1997 and 2003.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1997 and 2000, Turkey experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong
equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 17% of
GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 60% of GDP.
In this case, a high share of the debt was in foreign
currencies (46% of GDP)—leaving Turkey with a large
exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble
phase, investment inflows were low but positive, averaging
around 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital,
growth was moderate (at 2%), while levels of economic
activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 9%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 22%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged
more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken
together, these bubble pressures and Turkey’s dependence
on foreign financing created an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 2000 to 2001. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service
reached 30% of GDP, making Turkey vulnerable to a
shock—which came in the form of political turmoil and
violence. Turkey suffered a fall in foreign funding (with
capital inflows falling by 10% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by 157%) and a
meaningful decline in the currency (real FX fell by 12%)—
which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in GDP
(falling by 10%), and in stock prices (falling by 78%).
Unemployment rates increased by 3%, while currency
weakness contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking
at 62% during the depression phase, which is high compared
to other similar cases. That makes sense given that Turkey
had most of the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation
spirals (with the biggest risk factor being a long history of
poorly-controlled inflation). Turkey’s financial institutions
also came under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the
central bank spent down its reserves to defend the currency
(drawing down reserves by 100%), though it eventually
abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the attribution
chart to the right, even though Turkey needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 9% (6% annualized), in
part because the currency fell (which increased the burden
of foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the
government had to borrow more in response to the crisis
(with a peak fiscal deficit of 11% of GDP).

*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of
the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.

Argentina 1998–2012 Case Auto-Summary
As shown in the charts to the right, Argentina experienced a
transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle between 1998 and
2012. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its
currency go” in the face of external pressures, which
produces some temporary inflation but ultimately gives
policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates.

The gauges below are composed from a compendium of
stats shown in the chart deck that follows. Note these are
meant to be rough measures.

The Bubble Phase
Between 1998 and 2001, Argentina experienced a bubble
that was most characterized by unsustainably strong capital
inflows and strong currency returns. By the bubble’s end,
debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 78% of GDP. In this
case, a high share of the debt was in foreign currencies (47%
of GDP)—leaving Argentina with a large exposure to a
pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase,
investment inflows were strong, averaging around 11% of
GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of
5% of GDP. Growth was weak (at 0%), while levels of
economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 9%).
Competitiveness became an issue, as Argentina’s real FX
peaked at +39%. Taken together, these bubble pressures and
Argentina’s dependence on foreign financing, combined
with the weakened conditions of related countries, created
an unsustainable situation.

The Depression Phase
Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing
bust and a balance of payments/currency crisis, which ran
from 2001 to 2002. High debt levels left Argentina vulnerable
to a shock—which came in the form of ripples from the late
1990s crises in other EM countries. Argentina suffered a fall
in foreign funding (with capital inflows falling by 10% of
GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates
by 173%) and a meaningful decline in the currency (real FX
fell by 77%)—which coincided with self-reinforcing declines in
GDP (falling by 15%), and in stock prices (falling by 82%).
Unemployment rates increased by 3%, while currency
weakness contributed to high and rising inflation, peaking at
32% during the depression phase, which is normal compared
to other similar cases. That makes sense given that Argentina
had around half of the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation
spirals (with the biggest risk factor being a long history of
poorly-controlled inflation). Argentina’s financial institutions
also came under considerable pressure. Meanwhile, the
central bank spent down its reserves to defend the currency
(drawing down reserves by 66%), though it eventually
abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the attribution
chart to the right, even though Argentina needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 118% (62% annualized), in
part because the currency fell (which increased the burden of
foreign-denominated debts) and in part because the government had to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a
peak fiscal deficit of 4% of GDP).

2016. This is also a classic example of a country “letting its

The Bubble Phase
Between 2005 and 2008, Iceland experienced a bubble that
was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of unsustainably strong
capital inflows, rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong
housing returns. Debts rose by 565% of GDP during the
bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 1173% of GDP. In this case, a
high share of the debt was in foreign currencies (691% of
GDP)—leaving Iceland with a large exposure to a pullback in
foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows
were strong, averaging around 37% of GDP, which helped to
finance a current account deficit of 18% of GDP. Aided by that
rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 7%).
Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 12%
annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more
borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken together,
these bubble pressures and Iceland’s dependence on foreign

the currency (real FX fell by 29%)—which coincided with
self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 11%), in stock prices
(falling by 96%) and in home prices (falling by 15%).
Unemployment rates increased by 5%, while currency weakness
contributed to moderate inflation, peaking at 18% during the
depression phase, which is low compared to other similar cases.
That makes sense given that Iceland had only about a quarter of
the classic “risk factors” for bigger inflation spirals (with the
biggest risk factor being high foreign-denominated debts).
Iceland’s financial institutions also came under considerable
pressure. Meanwhile, the central bank spent down its reserves
to defend the currency (drawing down reserves by 18%), though
it eventually abandoned its currency defense. As shown in the
attribution chart to the right, even though Iceland needed a

(with a peak fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP).

Appendix: Macroprudential Policies
While the central bank is generally meant to provide one monetary policy for all (making money and credit
broadly available through banks without deciding who gets it) and those who run fiscal policy are meant to
apportion it well, macroprudential policies are tools for directing credit one way or another through the central
bank’s regulatory authorities. The need for macroprudential monetary policy is created by differentiation as
credit grows: There can be a bubble in one area, and a starvation of credit in another area. If policy makers want
to slow down credit where bubbles are emerging, and redirect credit to other areas, macroprudential policies can
shift credit in that way. For instance, a classic countercyclical macroprudential policy is to make it easier to buy a
house in a housing bust (say, by forcing credit standards lower or allowing lower down payments) or to make it
harder to buy a house in a housing bubble (by doing the opposite).
By directing credit through regulatory authorities, macroprudential policies can resemble fiscal policies in that
they can benefit some at the expense of others. While this is generally avoided, the challenges of managing an
economy through a deleveraging make macroprudential policies a really useful tool to complement monetary
policy. For instance, QE often fuels pockets of frothiness in the economy, particularly in asset markets, even as
the broader economy is still in recovery. In the Great Depression and during World War II, central bankers used
macroprudential measures to reduce the pockets of frothiness, while keeping overall monetary policy sufficiently
easy for the broader economy.
Macroprudential policies are not a new tool for monetary policy. In fact, they were a bread-and-butter tool of
central banks and regulators for almost the entire period of modern monetary policy. As an illustration, the
Federal Reserve has changed margin requirements for equity holdings 23 times since it was formed, typically
tightening the requirement during big rallies/periods of excess in stock market credit, and easing in bear
markets/depressed volumes of credit.1 While macroprudential measures became rarer from the early 1990s to
mid-2000s,2 that period is the historical exception. Recently, global central banks and regulators have returned to
a world where macroprudential tools are thought of as a key part of managing an economy.
The typical case (drawing on the history of macroprudential tools being used in the US)…
Occurred when shifting interest rates was losing effectiveness as a monetary policy tool.
••

The economy needs further stimulation, but with interest rates at zero, further easing is limited.

••

 ightening in one or more areas is needed when it’s not appropriate for the overall economy. Raising
T
interest rates is undesirable because of the drag on growth it would cause.

Occurred when it was desirable to direct credit both to credit-starved sectors, and away from frothy assets/
lending.
Involved policy makers using a combination of different types of policies at once.

Changing the cost of loans through interest rate subsidies/tax policy/other regulations.

And measures aimed at changing the supply of credit:
––

Changing capital/reserve requirements for certain types of lending.

––

Interest/lending rate ceilings and other limitations.

Saw coordination between the Federal Reserve, Congress, the executive branch, and regulatory bodies.
••

During the most successful cases, different parts of the government coordinated their actions. Often,
lawmakers and the executive branch armed different government bodies, including the Federal Reserve,
with the tools and the leeway to manage policy.

••

New institutions were set up to implement the regulations and monitor their progress.

Saw mixed success for different policies—some were more effective, while others had bad second-order consequences. The most successful cases involved significant amounts of experimentation and flexibility.
••

In successful cases, effective policies were frequently used for long periods of time, or expanded, and
unsuccessful policies were ended, often within a matter of months.

••

But policy makers have a mixed track record of quickly ending ones with distortionary second-order
consequences. A few were allowed to continue for years (Regulation Q, for instance).

••

As the financial system has evolved, policy makers have relied on a changing set of tools as the cost/
benefit trade-off of using different tools has evolved.

••

When financial innovations made it easier to circumvent certain policies (e.g., new ways for investors to
leverage up, new financial institutions springing up), certain policies were adapted or abandoned.

Questions to Consider Pertaining to Macroprudential Policy
As we observe the different cases, we see different issues and questions that policy makers grapple with in
implementing macroprudential policy. Below we go through these questions and then give some examples of
historical debates.
Where are bubbles emerging in the economy? How confident are you that they are bubbles?
••

At different points in history, policy makers have taken various approaches to dealing with bubbles.
––

I n a repeat of the late 1920s, US policy was tightening in 1935–36 in part in response to rapid stock
price appreciation that caused fears of a bubble. That tightening ended up being too much for the
deleveraging economy to bear. The economy went back into severe recession and stocks fell 60
percent between 1937 and 1938.

––

 ver the past several decades US monetary policy makers took a “mopping up” approach, with
O
the notion that they should not be involved with pricking bubbles but rather should deal with the
implications of a bubble popping on the economy.3 A key reason was the difficulty in knowing when the
market is mispricing an asset. So, for example, despite some concerns in the housing market, regulators
didn’t aggressively target slowing the increase of frothy mortgage lending in 2006 and earlier.

Which sectors are starved for credit? Is there a need for differentiated credit policy?
••

Policy makers in the 1950s grappled with this question by trying to formalize a framework to assess when
differentiated policy is necessary.4 They developed four basic tests:
––

How effective is general monetary policy in balancing the provision of credit to the economy?

––

How potentially destabilizing is the growth of the credit in the specific sector?

210 Part 3: Appendix

––

How important is credit to the growth of the specific sector?

––

How effective would it be to administer selective credit controls?

How comfortable are you picking winners and losers as part of directing credit? What are the political costs?
What policy tools will you choose to re-direct credit? Will you target demand for credit, or supply of credit, or both?
How will you measure effectiveness of the policy?
 hat will be the second- and third-order consequences of the policy? How will you handle them? Often, these
W
can come years later.
••

Regulation Q, which put caps on interest rates for deposits, was implemented during the Great Depression
to give smaller banks a leg up. By the 1950s, it started to create substantial distortions, driving deposits
into shadow banking systems.5

••

Savings & Loan Associates (S&L, a small type of bank) were deregulated in the early 1980s, in part to help
those institutions cope with tight monetary policy, contributed to the S&L crisis that began in the mid-1980s.6

 ow will you ensure policy coordination between legislators, the executive branch, and the central bank? How
H
will you empower regulators to make changes?
••

The most successful US cases represented broad coordination between different government agencies.
The Second World War effort was a good example—Congress revised several laws to give the Federal
Reserve the authority it needed, Roosevelt used executive orders to supplement the Fed’s efforts, etc.7

••

In the most successful cases (Volcker’s time at the Fed, for instance), policy makers were given the ability
to shift policy nimbly as circumstances changed. Some of the biggest issues came from low flexibility—
interest rates caps were not flexibly adapted and negative second-order consequences emerged.

••

Today, this remains a key question and there are differences in how different governments have vested
powers. In the UK for example, much of the power for regulation and macroprudential policy has been
vested in the BoE, and the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) within it. In the US, it has been vested in a
number of agencies and a coordinating committee setup after the financial crisis, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council (FSOC).8

Some Historical Cases of US Macroprudential Policies
In the next few pages, we go through historical cases of US macroprudential policies from the last century. It’s a long
list, so we organized them into seven categories according to the type of policy, and we go through each category
chronologically. We relied on the excellent and authoritative paper, “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential Policy
in the United States” by Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert, for the below framework and historical details.

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Demand for Credit: Margin Requirements
The margin requirement is the amount of collateral—often cash—that investors need to provide in order to buy
an investment using credit. Increasing the requirement puts downward pressure on the amount of credit used to
purchase financial assets.
After attaining the ability to set margin requirements from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Fed used
this ability counter-cyclically.9 In practice, the Fed would increase the margin requirement when asset prices
were booming and the use of credit for asset purchases was rising, and decrease it in the opposite situation.
••

 pecifically, Regulation T set margin requirements for brokers and Regulation U set the margin
S
requirement for banks.

••

All of the Fed’s changes to the margin requirements are shown in the chart below.

••

 ince 1974, the Federal Reserve mostly stopped using this lever, as the development of other ways of
S
buying assets on credit (e.g., derivatives) made it easy for investors to side-step this requirement.

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Demand for Credit: Underwriting Standards
Great Depression
Congress created the Federal Home Loan Bank System in 1932.10 It was designed to act as a quasi-central bank
for S&Ls, with the ability to provide liquidity through advances or collateralized lending. The FHLB System was
also in charge of setting underwriting standards and collateral restrictions.
In 1934, Congress formed the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure home loans.11 This resulted in
easier underwriting standards (80 percent loan-to-value and 20-year maturity) for loans eligible for insurance.
••

 he Electric Home and Farm Authority, established in 1934, was meant to provide cheap loans for home
T
electric appliances. These loans had <10 percent interest rate and only a 5 percent down payment, for up
to 36 months. This program ended in 1942.12

••

In 1935 Congress lowered the loan-to-value regulations (from 50 percent to 60 percent) and maturity
restrictions (from up to 5 years to 10 years) for national banks.13

••

The FHA insured up to 20 percent of loans (up to 5-year maturity) for improving residential properties
from 1934–1937.14

••

The FHA, in 1938, lowered standards for insurance on home loans. Mortgages with up to 90 percent loanto-value and 25-year maturity were now eligible.15

World War II
•• In 1941, President Roosevelt ordered the Federal Reserve Board to limit the use of installment credit
to purchase consumer durable goods. Roosevelt wanted to direct production toward national defense
rather than domestic consumption. In an executive order, he said: “liberal terms for such credit tend to
stimulate demand for consumers’ durable goods, the production of which requires the materials, skills,
and equipment needed for national defense.”16
––

 he Federal Reserve responded by enforcing tighter underwriting on all types of consumer
T
installment loans (known as Regulation W).17

Post-War Period
•• In October 1950, the Federal Reserve Board, worried about the rise in mortgage debt, aimed to tighten
housing credit. Their response was Regulation X.18

212 Part 3: Appendix

••

••

••

••

––

 egulation X was a set of loan-to-value and maturity caps on residential real estate loans that became
R
more restrictive as loan size grew.

––

The Fed set the target of reducing housing production in 1951 by one-third of the 1950 levels.

In response to President Truman’s requests, in 1950, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and
Veterans Administration (VA) raised the down payment requirement by 5 percent, decreased the
maximum FHA loan on single-family homes from $16,000 down to $14,000, and instituted a maximum
maturity of 25 years. These were the FHA’s and VA’s first restrictive actions in their nearly 20 years of
existence.19
––

 esponding to a recession beginning in mid-1953 and political pressures, these measures were
R
removed.

––

I n August 1954, Congress reversed the FHA’s and VA’s actions—reducing maximum down payment
requirements on FHA loans and raised the maximum FHA loan.

By late-1954, the housing market looked increasingly frothy. However, the Fed did not want to tighten,
because the economy was just recovering from a recession. Therefore the government pursued a number
of macroprudential policies instead20 (listed below):
––

 irst: the FHA and VA raised down payment requirements and reduced maximum maturities on
F
loans, from 30 to 25 years (these were tweaked and eventually reversed in subsequent years)

––

 econd: field offices were instructed to “intensify their surveys of local housing markets, and to take
S
coordinated steps to restrain federal underwriting of mortgages in localities where housing surpluses
were found to exist.”

––

 hird: the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) asked Federal Home Loan banks to curb
T
extension of loan commitments to thrifts. In September 1954, they also implemented official
restraints on lending by savings and loans banks.

––

 inally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved to restrain mortgage warehouse lending.
F
Mortgage warehouse lending is when commercial banks extend interim loans to finance the
origination of mortgages by nonbank lenders. This had more than doubled between August 1954 and
August 1955.

The Credit Control Act, passed in 1969, gave the Federal Reserve the ability to use credit controls to target
certain sectors. By targeting certain sectors, the Fed could keep overall monetary policy easy, but tighten
sectors experiencing inflation.21
––

 he Fed’s levers included: prescribing a “maximum rate of interest, maximum maturity, minimum
T
periodic payment, maximum period between payments, and other specification or limitation of the
terms and conditions of any extension of credit.”

––

The Credit Control Act was not used until the Volcker era.

In 1982, Congress abolished restrictions on loan-to-value ratios and maturities for national banks.22

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Supply of Credit: Voluntary Guidelines Aimed at Reducing
Speculative/Non-Productive Lending
In the following examples, policy makers imposed voluntary restraints or guidelines on the banks, in order to
curb lending for speculative or non-productive ends.
••

Congress, in 1947, encouraged banks to “restrict voluntarily their lending and investing programs.”23 This
guideline was put in place after the Fed’s limits on consumer installment loans expired.

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 213

••

During the Korean War, Congress enacted the Defense Production Act of 1950. This gave the Federal
Reserve the authority to establish “voluntary” credit restraints.24
––

••

 he Federal Reserve asked lenders to “screen loan applications on the basis of their [loan’s] purpose,
T
in addition to the usual tests of credit worthiness.” The program was in place for about a year.

In 1965, the cabinet-level Committee on the Balance of Payments recommended “voluntary” lending
restraints, to be monitored by the Federal Reserve.25
––

This policy sought to reduce net capital outflows by over 15 percent from the previous year.

––

 he program called for an initial 5 percent ceiling on foreign loan growth, the first time such a
T
quantitative credit target was put in place.

––

I n 1968, President Johnson passed an Executive Order which allowed the Federal Reserve to make
the program mandatory. However, the Fed chose not to, citing the high voluntary participation. The
programs continued until 1974.

••

In 1966, the Fed prompted banks to slow business loans. At the time, business credit creation was high
and inflation was rising. For banks that did not cooperate, the Fed limited their ability to borrow at the
discount window. After the economy slowed, the policy was ended.26

••

From March to July 1980, President Carter established the “voluntary” Special Credit Restraint Program.
Under the program, banks, bank holding companies, finance companies, and foreign bank branches were
asked to limit loan growth to 6-9%.27

••

––

 rom a high level, the program was designed to restrain certain types of speculative or inflationary
F
lending, while maintaining availability of funds to small businesses, farmers, and home buyers. Banks
were encouraged to “maintain availability of funds to small business, farmers, home buyers and others
without access to other forms of financing” and ensure that “credit for automobiles, home mortgage
and home improvement loans should be treated normally in the light of general market conditions.”

––

 onversely, banks were encouraged to restrain credit card lending and to limit other unsecured consumer
C
loans. The program also asked banks to limit credit used to support “essentially speculative uses of
funds, including voluntary buildup of inventories by businesses beyond operating needs, or to finance
transactions such as takeovers or mergers that can be reasonably postponed, that do not contribute to
economic efficiency or productivity, or may be financed from other sources of funds.” Speculative lending
also covered “financing of purely speculative holdings of commodities or precious metals.”

––

The Special Credit Restraint Program called for periodic reports on lending activities.

 imilar tools were used in Europe. National credit councils in France and Italy would announce which
S
sectors they thought needed more credit or were already over-burdened, especially in the post-war period.28

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Supply of Credit: Reserve Requirements
••

State governments instituted the first reserve requirements in the 1800s, to ensure that state-chartered
banks had enough reserves (typically gold or other specie) to meet their obligations (in the form of
circulating bank notes) and to meet deposit withdrawals. The National Bank Act, passed in 1863,
introduced the first nationwide reserve requirements for banks.29

••

Congress eased reserve requirements in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.30 This is because, with the
Federal Reserve now serving as a lender of last resort for national banks, Congress viewed reserve
requirements as less critical.

••

In the 1930s and afterwards, reserve requirements were again seen as a more useful counter-cyclical
policy tool. In 1935, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the ability to set the reserve requirement.31 In
conjunction with Roosevelt’s economic recovery program in the spring of 1938, the central bank lowered

214 Part 3: Appendix

reserve requirements. In the 1940s, the Federal Reserve made a series of adjustments to the reserve
requirements: in 1942, reserve requirements were eased three times. During the war, the Federal Reserve
held requirements steady, and following the war (in 1948) the requirements were tightened three times—
back to the statutory caps. Between 1949 and 1951, the reserve requirements were adjusted nine times; the
Federal Reserve eased them in 1949 and tightened them in 1951.
••

During periods of tightening interest rates, the Federal Reserve also raised the reserve requirements in
1966–69, 1973, and 1979–80.32

••

Eventually, new funding instruments were invented to continue lending and bypass the reserve
requirement. These included commercial paper, eurodollars, repurchase agreements, and largedenomination certificates of deposits.33

••

In 1969, the Federal Reserve attempted to address the loopholes that were enabling banks to skirt the
reserve requirements. New bank borrowing from overseas branches was capped at 10%; this was done to
stop banks from borrowing eurodollars through their overseas branches (which were not subject to reserve
requirements). Additionally, the Fed set a 10 percent limit on assets sales by banks to their overseas branches.34
––

I n 1970, the limits on both borrowing from and selling assets to overseas branches were increased to
20 percent. However, in 1973, these requirements were both lowered down to 8 percent. This was the
same requirement as was in place for large-denomination certificates of deposits.35

••

In the late 1960s, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) used reserve requirements to affect
mortgage lending. The FHLBB reduced requirements when savings declined, thereby increasing liquidity
in mortgage lending, and raised requirements when lending was high, or liquidity already abundant.36

••

As part of Paul Volcker’s effort to rein in inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates and
reserve requirements in October 1979. Reserve requirements on wholesale liabilities rose to 8 percent
(wholesale liabilities included large time deposits, eurodollar borrowings, repos with government or
agency collateral backing, and federal funds borrowings).37
––

I n March 1980, the reserve requirements were increased to 10%. One month later, the central bank
lowered the requirements to 5 percent and eventually eliminated them entirely in July.

••

The FHLBB eased the reserve requirements in 1968–69 and 1973–74, when liquidity for mortgage lending
was squeezed. It had “at most a limited, positive impact on mortgage lending.”38

••

In 1980, the Fed imposed unprecedented asset-based reserve requirements to reduce inflation. This fell
under their control due to the 1969 Credit Control Act.39 The exact requirements were as follows:
––

 ll lenders were required to hold a special deposit of 15 percent on specific types of consumer credit.
A
Money-market funds were subject to the same reserve requirements. Both were later lowered to 7.5
percent.

––

Money-market funds were also required to file monthly reports.

––

 y August, the Fed removed all of the restrictions completely, and by the end of 1980, Congress
B
terminated the Credit Control Act.

••

The Federal Reserve lowered reserve requirements in 1990 and 1992 to promote credit availability.40

••

To briefly provide some perspective from Europe, liquidity ratios and reserve requirements there have
also been used as macroprudential tools. France and Italy would particularly use different reserve
requirements to help direct credit—for instance, giving public banks more lenient requirements, or
excluding long-term or export loans.41

••

Regulators more often used some types of caps on the amount of loans, or the ability of banks to access
central bank financing for lending—tools which had similar net effects of putting downward pressure
on the supply of credit. For instance, until 1972 France had a “rediscount ceiling,” a cap that limited how
much a financial institution could borrow from the central bank.42

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 215

••

The cap often differed by sector or by type of loan, designed to encourage or discourage certain types
of lending. For instance, overproduction in certain agricultural products led the Banque de France
to set lending quotas in those sectors.43 Sometimes, these caps were broader, targeting all lending to
corporations or households.44

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Supply of Credit: Interest Rate Ceilings
••

In the early 1900s, states limited the interest rates a bank could offer for deposit accounts. This was part
of state deposit insurance programs.45

••

Under the amended Federal Reserve Act of 1927, a cap was placed on interest paid by national banks to
state banks.46

••

After the passage of the Banking Act of 1933, the Federal Reserve was able to regulate maximum interest
rates paid on time and savings deposits.47
––

I n November 1933, the Fed imposed Regulation Q: a 3 percent ceiling on interest rates. After a decline
in market rates, the Fed lowered this to 2.5 percent, reducing the costs for the banks.

––

 egulation Q also allowed the Fed to set maximum rates the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
R
(FDIC) paid to non-member insured banks.

––

 he Fed did not want to limit bank balance sheets, so it later raised the maximum rate back to 3
T
percent (for all savings and time deposits with maturities of six months or more). This allowed banks
to attract more depositors with a higher interest rate.

––

As market rates rose again in 1960 and 1961, the Federal Reserve raised Regulation Q ceilings.

••

From 1934 to 1989, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) was responsible for supervising savings
and loans. The FHLBB set informal ceilings on dividends paid by savings and loans, which were generally
about 25-50 basis points above the Fed funds rate.48

••

Under the Interest Rate Regulation Act of 1966 the FDIC and FHLBB were able to set interest rate ceilings
on deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loans. This act also allowed the Federal Reserve to
set rates for specific classes of deposits.49
––

 he Fed used this authority to set a 5.5 percent limit on single-maturity CDs. It also lowered the
T
maximum interest rates paid on time deposits.

––

However, in 1973, this ceiling on CDs was removed.

••

In 1978, the Fed allowed banks to issue money-market certificates with floating interest rate ceilings
pegged to the six-month Treasury bill. The banks were now able to issue instruments competitive with
money-market funds. This was a relaxation of previous Regulation Q ceilings.50

••

The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in March, 1980, eliminated
Regulation Q. In the end, Regulation Q was considered unsuccessful because there were many ways to get
around it.51

••

By 1986, the ceilings were gradually phased out.52

Macroprudential Measures Aimed at Supply of Credit: Supervisory Guidance and “Direct Pressure”
Guidance to curtail lending in booms
•• After World War I, the Federal Reserve wanted to direct credit toward what it deemed as productive
rather than speculative uses. It used supervisors to exert “direct pressure” on the banks.53
••

By the middle of 1927, policy makers were nervous about stock market speculation. In the previous year,
stocks rose by almost 100 percent, and credit creation was booming. The central bank, in February of 1929,
issued a statement to denounce speculation; the Fed stated it would not lend to banks that were extending
credit for speculation. The Fed’s statement was largely ineffectual at stemming speculation.54

••

On November 24th, 1947, supervisors of lending standards issued a statement urging for bank caution.
They were concerned that there were both excessive credit creation in the economy and falling credit
standards. The statement said that banks “should curtail all loans either to individuals or business for
speculation in real estate, commodities or securities.”55

••

Supervisors again released several statements detailing a deterioration in lending standards in the 1990s
and 2000s.56
––

 pecifically, in 1995 the Fed warned that examiners should watch for excessive easing in credit
S
underwriting standards. The Fed was also concerned about the risks of a cyclical downturn in
regional real estate markets. This was due to previous experiences with the S&L crisis in the 1980s.

––

I n 1999, supervisors issued a statement that detailed the risks of subprime lending. They also
suggested raising the capital standards for those institutions engaged in the practice. This came after
several banks failed the year before, due to subprime lending losses.

––

 wo years later, the agencies quantified the new capital standards. The statement suggested that
T
banks hold between 1.5x–3x more capital against subprime loans, versus assets of a similar type.

––

I n the early and mid-2000s, Federal officials made several statements that expressed concern over
frothy credit growth.

––

 upervisors took further action in 2005, issuing guidance on home equity and commercial real estate
S
lending as well as on nontraditional mortgages.

––

I n 2013, the Fed and OCC tightened regulation of leveraged loans, adopting a 6x leverage limit,
threatening fines.

Credit availability during busts
•• In order to promote credit creation, President Roosevelt asked regulators in April, 1938 to “agree on a
more liberal bank examination policy.”57

Principles For Navigating Big Debt Crises 217

••

The Treasury, along with three federal supervisors, responded by issuing a joint statement that outlined
the unified treatment of loans and securities. The procedures described a move away from mark-tomarket accounting for securities. They also distinguished “investment” and “speculative” securities.
Investment securities were assigned one of the four highest grades from the rating agencies.

••

As the S&L crisis of the 1980s came to an end, the administration moved to ease the credit crunch.58
––

 irst: in May of 1990, the OCC, Fed, and FDIC leaders urged senior bank officials to extend loans to
F
borrowers.

––

 upervisors published a report to “clarify regulatory policies” in March 1991. The supervisors did
S
not ease supervisory standards, despite stating that “It is possible, however, that some depository
institutions may have become overly cautious in their lending practices.”

••

Shortly after his election, President Clinton pursued a new credit availability initiative. The supervisors
issued a concurrent joint statement, meant to encourage banks to lend.59

••

Clinton’s initiatives attempted to make small business lending easier by reducing the “appraisal burden”
and enhancing the appeals by bankers of examiners’ decisions.

••

Supervisors, from 2007–2009, encouraged banks to lend and to work with distressed borrowers, without
weakening the standards of examination.60

Productivity and Structural Reform:
Why Countries Succeed & Fail, and What Should Be
Done So Failing Countries Succeed
by Ray Dalio
In this report the drivers of productivity are shown and are used to create an economic health index. That index
shows how 20 major countries are doing as measured by 19 economic health gauges made up of 81 indicators,
and it shows what these gauges portend for real GDP growth in each of these countries over the next 10 years.
As you will see, past predictions based on this process have been highly reliable. For this reason this economic
health index provides both a reliable prognosis for each of these country’s growth rates over the next 10 years
and a reliable formula for success. By looking at these cause-effect relationships in much the same way as a
doctor looks at one’s genetics, blood tests and regimes for exercise and diet, we can both see each country’s
health prospects and know what changes each can make so that these countries can become economically
healthier.
We are making this research available in the hope that it will facilitate the very important discussions about
structural reforms that are now going on and will help both the public and policy makers to look past their
ideological differences to see the economy as a machine in much the same way as doctors see bodies as a
machine and look at the relationships of cholesterol and heart attacks analytically rather than ideologically.

The Template
This study is presented in three parts:
•

In Part 1, “The Formula For Economic Success,” we show how indicators of countries’ productivity and
indebtedness would have predicted their subsequent 10-year growth rates going back 70 years, and
how these economic health indicators can be used to both predict and shape the long-term economic
health of countries. By knowing the linkages between a) indicators of productivity such as the costs of
educated people, the amount of bureaucracy in the government, the amount of corruption in the system,
how much people value working relative to enjoying life, etc., and b) the subsequent 10-year economic
outcomes, policy makers can decide how to change these determinants to affect long-term outcomes.

•

In Part 2, “Economic Health Indices by Country, and the Prognoses That They Imply,” we show each of
the 20 countries’ economic health indices by component and aggregated, and how these lead to the
projected growth over the next 10 years. In this section you can see a synthesis for each country based
on an objective review of each of the indicators and their relative importance. Because our
understanding has been completely systematized, there is no qualitative judgment used in describing
these estimates. In fact, the texts have been computer generated.

•

In Part 3, “The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years,” we look at how different
countries’ shares of the world economy have changed over the last 500 years and why these changes
have occurred.

Part 1: The Formula for Economic Success
What determines which countries prosper and which countries don’t? What determines different countries’
future growth rates? For our investment purposes we look at relationships between causes and effects that we
hope will be useful to others in answering these questions.
While many people have provided opinions about why countries succeed and fail economically, they have not
shown linkages between causes and effects. As a result, their opinions can be misleading. Often, even commonly
agreed-upon indicators of what is good for an economy have not been properly analyzed and correlated with
subsequent results. For example, everyone knows that having a more educated population is better than having
a less educated population, so naturally we hear that improving education is important to improving
productivity. However, indicators of the cost-effectiveness of education are lacking and correlations of the
factors with subsequent growth don’t exist, at least to my knowledge. That is dangerous. For example, if policy
makers simply educate people without considering the costs and paybacks of that education, they will waste
resources and make their economies less productive even though we will become more educated people. To
make matters worse, the views of those who influence policies typically reflect their ideological inclinations (e.g.,
being politically left or right), which divides people. For this reason, I believe that objective good indicators that
are correlated with subsequent results are needed so that the facts speak for themselves and help people reach
agreement about what should be done. That is what I believe I provide here. The economic health indicators that
I will show would have predicted the subsequent 10-year real growth of the 20 countries shown over the last 70
years within 2% of the realized growth about 85% of the time and within 1% two-thirds of the time, with the
average miss of less than 1%.
While I believe that the body of evidence I will show you is compelling, I certainly don’t claim to have all the
answers or expect people to blindly follow what is presented here without poking at it. On the contrary, I am
putting these cause-effect relationships on the table to help foster the debate to bring about progress. I hope
that people of divergent views will explore and debate how the economic machine works by looking at both the
logic and the evidence presented here, then see what it portends for the future, and then explore what can be
done to make the future better. Having said that, we are confident enough in these estimates to bet on their
accuracy, which we do in our investments.

The Determinants of Economic Health Are Timeless and Universal
As with human bodies, I believe that the economies of different countries have worked in essentially the same
ways for as far back as you can see so that the most important cause-effect relationships are timeless and
universal. In this section I review these cause-effect relationships and look at many countries in different
timeframes to show how they worked. I will lay these out for you to consider. I don’t believe that it’s good
enough to just show the correlations between changes in these factors and their outcomes. I believe that it’s
necessary to be so clear on the fundamental cause-effect relationships that it seems obvious that they must be
so; otherwise you can’t be confident that a relationship is timeless and that you aren’t missing something. I will
first present the concepts and then take you into the indicators to show how they worked in the past and what
they portend for the future.

What Are the Keys to Success?
I Will Start with a Top-Down Perspective: As with health, many factors (reflected in many statistics) produce
good and bad outcomes. You can approach them by looking down on the forest or building up from the trees. In
presenting them I wrestled with whether to start at the top and work our way down through all the pieces or start
with all the pieces and work ourselves up to the big picture. I chose to approach this from the top down as that’s
the perspective that I’m more comfortable with. I prefer to simplify and then flesh out the picture. Receiving

information presented this way will require you to be patient with the sweeping generalizations I make until I get
down to the particulars that make them up, which will show both the norms and the exceptions.
Productivity Influences on Growth Are Intertwined with Debt Influences: While my objective is to look at
productivity in this section, in doing so I wanted to tie that into looking at the drivers of growth over the next 10
years, which is affected by debt as well as the drivers of productivity. In other words, productivity influences on
growth and debt influences on growth are unavoidably entangled. As explained in “How the Economic Machine
Works,” while productivity growth is ultimately what matters for long-term prosperity, and the effects of debt
cycles cancel out over time, the swings around that productivity long-term trend arising from debt cycles cancel
out over such long amounts of time (upwards of 100 years because of long-term debt cycles) that it is impossible
to look at growth periods without debt cycles playing a role in driving the outcomes. Of course, when one
lengthens the observed timeframe, the shorter-term volatility that is due to debt swings diminishes in
importance. We chose to look at rolling 10-year periods of 20 countries which gave us a sample size of 150
observations (where we measure every 5 years).
The Big Picture: Stepping away from the wiggles of any given day, and looking from the top down, one can see
that the big shifts in economic growth are about two-thirds driven by productivity and one-third driven by
indebtedness. “Luck” (e.g., having a lot of resources when the resources are valuable) and “conflict” (especially
wars) are also drivers.

Productivity
A country’s production (GDP) will equal its number of workers times the output per worker (productivity). One
can increase one’s productivity either by working harder or by working smarter. Productivity is driven by how
cost-effectively one can produce, so, relative productivity—i.e., competitiveness—will have a big effect on
relative growth. In a global economy those producers who are more competitive will both 1) sell more in their
own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they can produce more costeffectively. Likewise, investors will follow these opportunities.
Competitiveness (i.e., relative productivity levels) is driven by what you get relative to what you pay in one
country versus another. Countries are just the aggregates of the people and the companies that make them up.
As you know with the individuals you hire and from the products you buy, those that offer the most value for
money are the most competitive and do better than those that don't.
Specific Indicators: Since people are the largest cost of production, it follows that those countries that offer the
best “value” (i.e., the most productive workers per dollar of cost) will, all else being equal, experience the most
demand for their people. That is why the per-hour-worked cost differences of educated people (i.e., their income
after adjusting for hours worked each year) is one of the best indicators of productivity. Other obvious and
important factors that influence productivity include cost of uneducated people, levels of bureaucracy, attitudes
about work, raw material costs, lending, and capital market efficiencies—i.e., everything that affects the value of
what is produced relative to the cost of making it. In other words, there is a world market for productive
resources that increases the demand, and hence the growth rates, for the countries that are most competitive
because of “the cost of production arbitrage.” That cost of production arbitrage has been a big driver of
growth—in fact overwhelmingly the largest. To reiterate, the magnitude of this competitiveness arbitrage is
driven more by the cost of the workers relative to how hard they work, their education, and investment levels,
than by anything else. These variables characterize the value of hiring a worker in a given country and doing
business there (i.e., what you pay for what you get).
Of course, barriers to the flow of trade and capital (like China’s closed door policies until the early 1980s,
geographic isolation, etc.) can stand in the way of people, companies, and countries being allowed to compete.
As these barriers break down (e.g., transportation becomes cheaper and quicker, telecommunications reduce

26

impediments to intellectual competition, etc.) or increase (e.g., trade barriers are put up), the ability to arbitrage
the costs of production, and in turn the relative growth rates, is affected.
While countries that operate efficiently will grow at faster paces than countries that operate inefficiently, the
countries that will grow the fastest are those that have big inefficiencies that are disposed of. As an example,
in the 1970s and 1980s, China had a well-educated, intelligent labor force that could work for cheap, but faced a
closed-door policy. Opening the door unleashed China’s great potential. Looking forward, while the United
States is relatively efficient, it would not grow as fast as Russia (i.e., which has competitively priced educated
people with low debt) if Russia could significantly reduce its barriers to productivity (e.g., corruption, lack of
development of its debt/capital markets, lack of investment, lack of innovation, bad work attitudes, lack of
adequate private property laws, etc.). That is why I am most optimistic about inefficient countries that are
undertaking the sort of reforms that are described in this section.
Culture is one of the biggest drivers of productivity. It’s intuitive that what a country’s people value and how
they operate together matters for a country’s competitive position. Culture influences the decisions people make
about factors such as savings rates or how many hours they work each week. Culture can also help explain why
a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform, or vice versa. For
example, in Russia, which has a lot of untapped potential, the culture that affects lifestyles (e.g., alcoholism, the
low drive to succeed, etc.) causes it to substantially under-live its potential, while in Singapore, where high
income levels make their labor relatively uncompetitive, their lifestyles and values (e.g., around working, saving,
and investing) allow them to realize a higher percentage of their potential. While lots of elements of culture can
matter, the ones that I find matter most are: 1) the extent to which individuals enjoy the rewards and suffer the
penalties of their productivity (i.e., the degrees of their self-sufficiency), 2) how much the people value savoring
life versus achieving, 3) the extent to which innovation and commercialism are valued, 4) the degree of
bureaucracy, 5) the extent of corruption, and 6) the extent to which there is rule of law. Basically, countries that
have people who earn their keep, strive to achieve and innovate, and facilitate an efficient market-based
economy will grow faster than countries that prioritize savoring life, undermine market forces through highly
redistributive systems, and have inefficient institutions. To be clear, I am not making any value judgments. It
would be illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are making a mistake relative to people
who love working. It is, however, not illogical for me to say that people who savor non-work activities are likely
to be less productive than those who love working.

Indebtedness
At the risk of repeating myself too many times, I will review the way I look at debt cycles because I carry that
perspective into my calculations in explaining 10-year growth rates.
As explained, short-term volatility is more due to debt cycles than productivity, but this volatility cancels out over
time because credit allows people to consume more than they produce when they acquire it, and it forces people
to consume less than they produce when they pay it back. Undulations around long-term productivity are driven
by debt cycles. Remember, in an economy without credit, the only way to increase your spending is to produce
more, but in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. That creates cycles.
When debt levels are low relative to income levels and are rising, the upward cycle is self-reinforcing on the
upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worth, which raise borrowers’ capacity to
borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can’t rise faster than money and
income forever, there are limits to debt growth.
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited
amount of it that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can’t live on it forever. In the case of debt, you can
take it out before you put it in (i.e., if you don’t have any debt, you can take it out), but you are expected to return
what you took out. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the
appearance of being prosperous. At such times, you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as

being creditworthy and not pay enough attention to what paying back will look like. When debts can no longer
be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse.
You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being a
support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the
attractiveness of taking on new debt. For these reasons I expect countries that have a) low amounts of debt
relative to incomes, b) debt growth rates that are low in relation to income growth rates, and c) easier
monetary policies to grow faster over the next 10 years than countries with d) high amounts of debt relative to
incomes, e) debt growth rates that are high in relation to income growth rates, and f) tighter monetary
policies. That is true with one exception, which is when adequate financial intermediaries don’t exist.
Institutions and capital markets that facilitate these transactions have to be in place for the system to work. For
that reason, when forecasting long-term future growth rates, we have taken into consideration the levels of
development of countries’ financial intermediaries.
Luck and Wars: As mentioned, they can play a role. For example, the US having shale gas was lucky. Potential
conflicts should always be watched. While to some extent these can be anticipated, they are not part of our
formula and they don’t typically matter much—i.e., they are exceptional.

The Interaction of These Forces Is Driven by Human Nature
While productivity and indebtedness can be thought of as separate concepts, they are ultimately a function of
the choices people make and their psychology. I briefly touched on culture as an influence on these choices and
their outcomes. Also, I observe important shifts in attitudes from one generation to the next, which are due to
their different experiences. In Part 3, “The Rises and Declines of Economies Over the Last 500 Years,” I show
how psychology tends to shift as countries move through their economic life cycles. It is worth touching on this
influence here before I delve into an examination of what all the economic health indicators are pointing to for
the 20 major economies.
In addition to productivity and the debt cycles I spoke about, there tends to be a psychologically motivated cycle
that occurs as a function of one’s past level of prosperity and whether one experienced improving or worsening
economic conditions. When a country is poor and focused on survival, its people who have subsistence lifestyles
don’t waste money because they value it a lot and they don’t have any debt to speak of because savings are short
and nobody wants to lend to them. Even though the country’s labor is low-cost, it is not competitive, and the lack
of investment stymies future productivity gains. Some emerge from this stage and others don’t, with culture and
location being two of the biggest determinants. For those that do—either because a country removes a big
barrier like being closed to the world (as China did in 1980) or simply because a more gradual evolution makes
their labor attractive—a virtuous cycle can kick in. At this stage, the investments are not just inexpensive; the
stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of room to adopt existing
technologies that can radically improve the country’s potential. Leveraging up (increasing one’s indebtedness)
can feed back into higher productivity and competitiveness gains, which produce high returns that attract more
investment at a time when the capacity to leverage is high. The key is that this money and credit must be used to
produce investments that yield enough returns to pay for the debt service and finance further growth (so that
incomes rise as fast as or faster than debts). Yet as countries grow wealthier, more and more of the credit tends
to fuel consumption rather than investment. A process that was once virtuous can become self-destructive. The
decreased investment in quality projects means productivity growth slows, even as the borrowing and spending
makes incomes grow and labor more expensive. People feel rich and begin taking more leisure—after all, asset
prices are high—even though their balance sheets are starting to deteriorate. At this point, debt burdens start to
compound and incomes grow faster than productivity growth. In other words, the country tends to become
over-indebted and uncompetitive. The country is becoming poor even though it is still behaving as though it is
rich. Eventually the excess tends to lead to bubbles bursting, a period of slow decline and deleveraging. Suffice it
to say that when looking at a country’s potential to grow, it is critical to look at the country’s productivity and
indebtedness holistically, as part of its stage of development.

A Formula for Future Growth
As explained, my research team and I built the formula for future growth from the top down. We started with my
concepts of how productivity and indebtedness affect growth, then fleshed these forces out with specific
indicators, and then saw how the formula created this way worked. I followed this approach because I believe
that one should be able to describe the cause-effect relationships and the logic behind them without looking at
the data and that only after doing that should one look at the data to see how well the descriptions square with
what happened because otherwise one would be inclined to be blinded by data and not force oneself to
objectively test one’s understanding of the cause-effect relationships.
As mentioned, from what I can tell, about two-thirds of a country’s 10-year growth rates will be due to
productivity and about one-third will be due to indebtedness. The visual below conveys these two forces. Our
productivity indicators aim to measure how steep the productivity growth line will be over time, and our
indebtedness measures aim to measure how debt cycles will influence growth over the medium term.

Below is a list of what I have come to learn about these things along with the names of the indices my research
team and I created to reflect them. Based on the reasons outlined there, we created a simple logic-weighted
index of productivity and a simple logic-weighted index of indebtedness. We used the same set of factors
weighed the same way for each gauge across all the countries and across all timeframes. That way, there was no
fitting the data and our measures for productivity and indebtedness are timeless and universal. We put twothirds of the weight on productivity and a third on indebtedness.380 After creating these indices, we observed
how each predicted the subsequent 10 years’ growth rates for each country (which we measure every 5 years).
In other words, we observed rather than fit the data. The table below shows the concepts, their weights, and
their correlations with the next 10 years’ per capita growth rates for our universe of 20 countries. Together these
indicators were 86% correlated with the countries’ subsequent growth rates. Below we show how well these
measures related to future growth across countries and time.381

As mentioned, our gauges of productivity and indebtedness are constructed using simple logic-based weights. Within productivity, we put
two-thirds weight on what you pay versus what you get and one-third on culture. Within each of these gauges we put equal weight on the
different sub-pieces. Within our indebtedness gauge, we put half the weight on debt cycle dynamics and half on monetary policy.
381
My approach to research is to first think through what makes sense to me and then to look at the data to stress test my thinking. This is a
very different approach compared to optimization methods (or data mining) which typically go to the data first, and fish for relationships and
conclusions. Because I was asked how much better the results would be if we let the computer fit the equations, we ran the data-fitting
exercise and observed that if we do that, the correlations with future growth don't change much (they’re likewise in the range of 80-90%
correlated with future growth depending on the process used).

These measures of productivity and indebtedness can be used to predict each country’s absolute and relative
growth rates over the next 10 years, or longer periods. They also can be used by policy makers to indicate what
levers they can move to influence future growth. To reiterate, my goal is to get the big picture right—i.e., to
reliably be approximately right by focusing on the most important drivers rather than to try to be precise by
focusing on the details.
Before looking at the picture we will show you how our aggregate indicator would have predicted growth versus
what actually occurred. While staring at the observations helps us ground ourselves in reality and test our logic,
we know there is no precision in the specific numbers and what matters most to us is whether our logic is strong.
Our examination covers 150 separate observations across 20 different countries over the last 70 years, which
provides a wide range of different environments to test our indicator. Along with the correlation of our
predictions and what growth actually materialized (shown below), another test is how reliably we predicted
something reasonably close to what happened. In our set, our aggregate predictions for a country’s average
growth over the next decade were within 1% of the actual growth two-thirds of the time, and within 2% about
85% of the time.

Below we show the same perspective for each of our productivity and indebtedness gauges, comparing what
they implied individually for a country’s growth versus what happened. As you can see our measure of
productivity is more strongly correlated with each country’s growth than our indebtedness measure is (71%
versus 49%), which makes sense given it is the more important driver over the timeframes tested. Still, each has
a fairly good relationship on its own.

Because these are timeless and universal drivers, we expect them to be just as important in developed countries
as they are in emerging ones. The type of investment or education that matters may shift, but ultimately whether
a country sees productivity growth is still going to be largely a function of the basic building blocks of
productivity-----whether its workers offer value, whether it is investing and creating a culture of success-----as well
as how its indebtedness is evolving. Across the countries we have examined, our aggregate indicator is about as
correlated with future growth for developed and emerging countries (72% correlated with the growth in income
per worker in developed countries and 84% correlated in emerging countries). Of course, which countries are
‘‘developed’’ or ‘‘emerging’’ changes over very long periods as discussed in ‘‘The Rises and Declines of Economies
over the Last 500 Years.’’ So in the tests shown below, we adjust for that, for example excluding Japan in the
1960s when it was much more like an emerging country.

To reiterate, I believe getting to this fundamental level is critical to understanding and predicting the growth of
countries. Naïve measures of a country’s future growth—for example just income on its own or a country’s
trailing growth—won’t get you much because they won’t help you get at the drivers. They also tend to be much
worse predictors than the formula I have described here (about 25% as good by traditional statistical measures).
Looking at the economy as a machine and granularly measuring the cause-effect relationships makes all the
difference.

Projections
I will start with our projections and then explain how they were derived.
As discussed, by looking at the elements that drive productivity and indebtedness you can arrive at a view of how
fast a country will grow its output per worker. Since economic growth is mechanically just a function of growth in
its a) output per worker and b) number of workers, it’s then a simple step for us to estimate economic growth. In
the following section we quickly scan what our projections show. We go into greater depth on the reasons
behind them in Appendix A.
The following chart shows our estimate in aggregate for real GDP growth over 10 years in these major countries.
We provide two estimates: one that is based on the exact same formula for all countries and one that is that
estimate corrected for the average past error. This additional step notes whether we were systematically overoptimistic or pessimistic in our predictions for a given country, and adjusted for that, to account for the fact that
we may be missing a factor specific to that country.382 We simply found how much the universal formula was off
in the past on average (i.e., 1%) and assumed that it would be off by that amount over the next ten years. That
adjustment is meant to account for unexplained factors. These two estimates typically don’t yield meaningful
differences and don’t affect the order of the countries’ rankings much.

Note: In studying our misses, we realized that sometimes for a given country we were systematically over-optimistic about its growth or
pessimistic. Overall these biases are pretty small but they also raise the question of whether we are missing a specific factor that is
particularly important for that country (we know we can’t capture everything). The correlation shown above of 86% includes our adjustment
for these country-specific misses (for lack of a better term our ‘error adjustment’). It’s not a big deal—if we don’t make this adjustment the
correlation is 79% (i.e., a 79% correlation between our prediction for a country’s growth in income per worker over the next decade and the
growth in income per worker that materialized, across our sample of 20 countries and 150 datapoints). This allows us to show a type of
range in our estimates for countries, which highlights what we have gotten wrong in the past and its magnitude.

On the basis of productivity and indebtedness alone, the countries which have the elements to grow incomes per
worker fastest today are India, China, Mexico, Argentina, and Thailand. Based on these elements, peripheral
European countries and Canada are expected to grow slowest. We expect India to grow strongly (7% or so),
primarily because of India’s low indebtedness and significant cost advantage relative to the rest of the world even
accounting for its poor education (its income per capita is just $1,500, four times less than China’s). While
incomes have grown very fast in China and there has been a material leveraging, we still expect fairly strong
growth of a little over 4% due to China’s strong competitive position. The Chinese labor force remains highly
attractive as a result of their work ethic and how educated they are relative to the cost, and they continue to save
at a high rate, providing capital that is invested in projects that will improve productivity in the future. China’s
culture of self-sufficiency and achievement also provides a material support. Of course the policies of these
countries can shift these growth rates.
This formula projects productivity growth in the US to be around 1.6%-1.9%, in the middle of the pack globally,
and near the top of the list for other rich nations. The US has fallen a bit behind other competitive world
economies; in the last few years, rising incomes and falling innovation have primarily acted as a downward
pressure on US growth, in addition to a well-educated but expensive workforce, and a shifting preference among
American workers for leisure and very low savings rates. While it is managing its deleveraging beautifully, it
remains relatively highly indebted. We expect growth in Germany to be a bit lower than in the US. Germany is
expensive relative to the US, though central bank (ECB) stimulation is more stimulative at this point, and this
combined with its relatively low levels of debt should act as a tailwind for growth. Healthy household savings
rates, a culture of innovation and commercialism, and good governance are all also positive supports for
Germany's growth. On the lowest end we see the southern European countries, all of which are globally
uncompetitive and highly indebted, and have a history of experiencing monetary policy that is tight relative to
conditions, though this has been shifting in recent years with aggressive easing by the ECB. The growth
prospects of Italy and Spain, along with France and a number of Latin American countries are also hindered by a
culture that values savoring life over achievement or self-sufficiency.

How We Came to Our Estimates
Because GDP is just output per worker times the number of workers, that estimate includes two major pieces:
demographic trends (or, more specifically, the expected change in workers), and an estimate of future growth
per worker. We show the chart of the expected change in workers below. On this measure, you can see that
Europe, Russia, and Japan’s challenges are compounded by an aging and shrinking workforce, while countries like
Mexico and India will enjoy a growth in workers supporting their potential growth.

Our future growth per worker estimate includes two major components: a productivity estimate, and an
indebtedness estimate. We show both of these estimates below. They highlight the general attractiveness of the
labor arbitrage between most emerging countries relative to the developed world. There is also much more
room for these countries to leverage up whereas much of the developed world has reached its long-term debt
top and is deleveraging, which means there is more limited room for spending and income growth to come from
credit expansion.

and culture. For a detailed review of all of our underlying indicators, see Appendix A.

Productivity and Competiveness Measures
A country’s competitiveness is driven by the value of all that it offers relative to the value of what others offer
—most importantly the value of its people relative to their cost. In a global economy, countries that are more
productive will not only produce better value products, but they will also attract investment and new businesses,
and they will compel the means of production to move. We expect the producers who are more competitive to
both 1) sell more in their own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they
can produce more cost-effectively.
As explained, the most important way countries differentiate themselves is through their labor: whether it is
more attractive for a company to hire their workers than to hire workers in a different country. This is not just a
function of whether the workers are more productive today. It’s a function of the attributes that make them more
attractive to hire and invest in over the long term. Since ultimately the only way one can become more
productive is through working harder or working smarter, it makes intuitive sense to us that education and work
ethic are the most important attributes that matter. Those countries that offer these most cost-competitively
tend to do the best. A country may also be more attractive because it’s a cheap place to build a factory or
because the returns of building new capital and technologies are higher. Additionally, countries that save and
invest more tend to grow faster by creating new innovations, capital equipment, and infrastructure that help
improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited investment rates.
These are the most important ingredients for the productivity growth of a country. But that’s not all there is to it.
Partly, culture drives the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work
each week. But culture can also help explain why a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth
but consistently underperform.
Culture matters a lot. Ultimately how a country develops is a function of human behavior and the decisions its
people make. Many of those decisions are captured in the attributes that go into a country’s relative productivity
(like how much people save or how hard they work). But you can learn a lot about the psychology of the different
players in the economy and their motivations by staring at different cultural elements. Over very long stretches
of time a country’s cultural evolution is at the core of its long-term cycles (from being poor and believing it’s poor
to becoming rich). Over any decade, the way we think about culture is that it can help explain why a country can
appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform or outperform. For us it makes
intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve are more likely to
succeed by creating a meritocratic environment where incentives are based largely on market forces. Countries
can also outperform if they are more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and more
commercially minded in harvesting them. On the other hand, countries can underperform if they are corrupt or
bureaucratic, or if the rule of law is unsound. To be clear, we are not assessing whether one culture is good or
bad; our focus is on the cultural elements that are most important for economic prosperity.

Our Productivity Gauge
For these reasons, when we look at gauging the productivity of a country we create a measure of 1) the relative
value it offers and 2) its culture. We weigh the relative value of a country the most since it is the most important
determinant.
Our productivity gauge is just based on the logic we have described. It is mostly a function of the relative value
of a country’s workers (the labor arbitrage aspect): how educated they are relative to their cost and how hard the
people work relative to their cost. These measures give us a sense of whether a country’s workers have the
ingredients to grow their productivity by working harder or smarter. To triangulate the cost of an educated
worker we look at two measures, one that adjusts for the quality of education and one that looks at their
observed productivity today. Moving beyond a country’s human capital, we also look at investment relative to
the cost, which gives us a lens into whether a country is investing to grow its productivity in the future and
whether the returns are likely to be attractive (i.e., another perspective on the “cost of production arbitrage”).
To measure culture, we create a gauge for each of the concepts we have outlined: 1) whether a country values
self-sufficiency, 2) whether it values savoring the fruits of life or achieving, 3) whether it is innovative and
commercially oriented, 4) its degree of bureaucracy, 5) corruption, and 6) rule of law. Self-sufficiency
encourages productivity by tying the ability to spend to the need to produce. The concept of savoring life versus
achieving captures how much the people in a country are focused on enjoying the things they have versus trying
to increase their success and achieve, earn, and create more. Innovation and commercialism capture whether a
society is oriented toward seeking profit or generating new insights. The last three get at the basic questions of
how difficult it is to get business done in a country—i.e., whether a given country is one where businesses could
get off the ground and operate smoothly, where business can be conducted fairly (without corruption), and
whether investors and businesses can be confident that contracts and laws will be well enforced.
Together our indicators of productivity were 71% related to countries’ subsequent growth rates. To repeat, these
estimates were made by applying the exact same factors to all countries in all time periods to determine their
subsequent growth.

The chart below gives a picture of how we would rate countries today on productivity based on the same logic
described above. Our ratings are represented in terms of what a given country’s productivity would imply for
that country’s future growth in income per worker over the next 10 years.
According to our measures, India is best placed to see productivity growth at this point—driven by a very cheap
and achievement-oriented labor force, even accounting for poor education, chronic corruption, etc. Together
these factors imply India has the ingredients to grow income per worker around 9% annually over the next
decade. It also has sizable potential to boost its growth rate if it can reduce its inefficiencies through reforms.
China is also highly competitive by our measures, with a growth rate implied by its competitiveness/productivity
of about 6%. Its workforce is inexpensive and fairly well educated relative to its cost, works hard, and provides
huge savings for investments. Moreover, as a country that is becoming rich and starting to realize it, China has a
huge amount of potential to realize by adopting existing technologies, and investing in businesses to serve a
massive population that is quickly accumulating spending power. Nearly all developed world countries are
measured to be relatively uncompetitive, with Italy, Greece, France, and Spain uniquely uncompetitive (we
explain our reasoning in detail in Appendix A). Most importantly, these countries’ labor is expensive, they don’t
work that hard, and they invest less than most other countries. This is compounded by a social system that
prioritizes savoring life over achieving and insulates workers from market forces with rigid labor markets and
substantial government safety nets, low levels of innovation, and high levels of bureaucracy. It should be noted
that we have seen some structural reforms to improve productivity and competitiveness, especially in Spain, and
that such reforms have the potential to considerably boost growth because the barriers that reforms would bring
down are drags on growth. Japan is the most competitive of the major developed countries we measure,
especially after recent declines in Japan’s exchange rate.

The following two charts give you a summary of where each country stands on our assessment of value (i.e.,
what you pay for what you get) and whether its culture is a support to or drag on income growth. Overall, the
strong value proposition of Asia’s workers—especially how hard they work and their level of investment relative
to their expense—is supported by cultural attitudes around achievement. In contrast, Europe, once on the
frontier of productivity, now invests little and takes more leisure than any other region. And after years of
incomes rising faster than underlying productivity, its workers are some of the most expensive in the world and
the vibrancy of its labor market is undermined by a system of protections. Japan and Singapore are in the middle
of the pack when you look at their high cost of labor and low levels of investment, but we expect them to be
helped by cultural factors (e.g., their orientation toward innovation and commercialism and rule of law). In
contrast, cultural factors—like corruption, a desire for leisure over achievement—act as a drag for otherwise
competitive workforces in Russia and Argentina.

Part 2: Economic Health Indices by Country,
and the Prognoses That They Imply
While in Part 1 I explained how the economic health index worked, in this part I break it down country by country.
By turning to the countries that you are interested in, you will be able to see all of the influences and what they
imply for economic growth over the next 10 years for each of those countries in one simple table. They are shown
in the order of projected economic growth rates and can be found by looking at the table of contents on the next
page.
The projected economic growth rates for each country are shown and attributed to a) the average annual growth
rate of the working population and b) the projected average annual change in the output per worker. The
projected change in the average annual output per worker is determined two-thirds by that country's projected
productivity growth and one-third by the size of its debt burdens. The determinants of each country's
productivity growth are shown in several gauges that reflect each of the drivers (e.g., cost competitiveness, work
attitudes, etc.). These are conveyed in tables that show: 1) the deviation of that country's determinant from the
world average (shown in standard deviation terms), and 2) the ranking of that country (among the 20 countries
shown) for that indicator. In other words, this one simple table will provide you virtually all that you need to
know to gauge each country's economic health and its prospects for the next 10 years. By scanning the table and
reading the accompanying text, you will be able to see a country’s biggest strengths and biggest weaknesses.
The projections do not take into consideration exogenous factors such as the discoveries of natural resources
and wars which will influence growth rates and are beyond my ability to forecast.
The table will not provide the thinking or the individual statistics that are behind each of these gauges. Should
you wish to see a deeper explanation of the thinking behind each indicator, please see Appendix A. If you just
want to see the individual statistics behind these gauges, you can find them in Appendix B. Unfortunately, we are
not able to share the statistics underlying our indebtedness measures, which are proprietary.
To be clear, these health indicators show where the current conditions will lead, not what is inevitable. If
countries change the influences on their health, like individuals who stop smoking and start exercising, they can
improve their prognoses. In fact, while we expect the countries that are more efficient (as measured by our
gauges) to do better than those that are less efficient, we expect those that remove their impediments to have
the biggest improvements to growth – just as China’s strong growth over the last couple decades resulted from it
ending its closed-door policy.
It should be noted that there was no subjective judgment used in coming up with these numbers, or even in
coming up with the text that explains these indicators. Both the numbers and the text were computer generated.
As explained in Part 1 my process of converting indicators into health gauge measures and in turn into
projections for growth is very straightforward. To help it to be better understood and to provide each person
with their own abilities to vary the processes in the ways they prefer, I am willing to make these statistics and
processes open to those who are interested so that they can assess the relationships and change the weights in
the ways they think are best.

India's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that India's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 7.2% to 9.2%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 1 out of 20 major economies,
and 1 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In India’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a
5.9% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 1.3% which
will boost growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and indebtedness. Over
the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an important driver in the
short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our productivity measures about twothirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no precision here). Over the next 10
years, we expect India’s productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a growth rate of
9.3% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other countries (implying a growth rate of 5.1%
on its own). As shown below, India’s biggest relative strengths are the value its workers provide relative to
education levels and its levels of investment, and its biggest relative problems are its level of bureaucracy
(though compared to other countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on this measure). The various gauges and
weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and
listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences that are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a
composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

India offers much better than average value, ranked 1 among the countries we measure. Its workers are very
inexpensive, even taking into consideration India's low levels of education and very poor quality of education.
Further, people in India work very hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average male of working age works
36 hours per week (2 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are very favorable. Levels of
saving and investing are high given India's very low per capita income levels, with investment at about 14% of
GDP (15 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

India's culture looks to be a significant support to growth in coming years, ranked 2 out of 20 countries in this
culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare India to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, India is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers
have a somewhat strong work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 27%
of GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. India also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring—
again, its work ethic is somewhat strong, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very strong in India relative to income. We see the
country investing very heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions
and earnings, are very high. Finally, relative to its income, India has somewhat high bureaucracy and red tape,
very low corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law, according to the international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than
is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. India's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 1 out of the 20 countries we
look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 133% of GDP,
compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor
depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally a bit stimulative.

China's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that China's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 4.0% to 4.2%. This growth rate is well above the global average, ranked 2 out of 20 major economies,
and 2 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In China’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a
4.4% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of -0.2%
which will moderately weigh on growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity
and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an
important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our productivity
measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no precision here).
Over the next 10 years, we expect China’s productivity to be much better than most major countries (implying a
growth rate of 5.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly worse than other countries (implying
a growth rate of 1.2% on its own). As shown below, China’s biggest relative strengths are its levels of investment
and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and
debt service levels and its reliance on credit flows for growth. The various gauges and weights are shown below.
The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and listed in the appendix of

Starting with self-sufficiency, China is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a roughly
average work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at 29% of GDP), and its
labor markets are very flexible. China also seems to value savoring about the same as it values achieving—again,
its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement.
Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very strong in China relative to income. We see the country
investing very heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions and
earnings, are about average. Finally, relative to its income, China has somewhat low bureaucracy and red tape,

Mexico's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Mexico's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in

economies, and 3 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like

Argentina's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Argentina's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in

4 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In Argentina’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a
2.6% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 1.0%
which will boost growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and
indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an
important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our productivity
measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no precision here).
Over the next 10 years, we expect Argentina’s productivity to be about average compared to most major
countries (implying a growth rate of 1.9% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than other
countries (implying a growth rate of 3.8% on its own). As shown below, Argentina’s biggest relative strengths

Thailand
Thailand's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Thailand's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 3.5% to 4.4%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 5 out of 20 major
economies, and 5 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Thailand’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 3.9% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth
rate of -0.4% which will moderately weigh on growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Thailand’s productivity to be much better than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of 5.6% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better than
other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.3% on its own). As shown below, Thailand’s biggest relative
strengths are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its levels of investment, and its
biggest relative problems are its reliance on credit flows for growth and its monetary policy (though compared to
other countries it doesn't rate especially poorly on these measures). The various gauges and weights are shown
below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and listed in the
appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences that are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a
composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Thailand offers much better than average value, ranked 3 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
somewhat inexpensive, even taking into consideration Thailand's somewhat low levels of education and very
poor quality of education. Further, people in Thailand work hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average
male of working age works 36 hours per week (1 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are
about average. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat high given Thailand's low per capita income levels,
with investment at about 19% of GDP (6 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Thailand's culture looks to be a support to growth in coming years, ranked 3 out of 20 countries in this culture
gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Thailand to countries of similar levels of economic development.
Starting with self-sufficiency, Thailand is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a
somewhat strong work ethic, its level of government support is low (with government outlays at 22% of GDP),
and its labor markets are very flexible. Thailand also seems to value savoring about the same as it values
achieving—again, its work ethic is somewhat strong, though surveys suggest that its people don't especially
value accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in
Thailand relative to income. We see the country investing very heavily in research and innovation, though its
outputs from innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, relative to its income, Thailand has
very low bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and very strong rule of law, according to the
international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than
is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Thailand's indebtedness position is slightly better than other countries, ranked 5 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has a bit of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
192% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither
supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally neutral.

Singapore's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Singapore's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 3.2% to 3.6%. This growth rate is somewhat above the global average, ranked 6 out of 20 major
economies, and 1 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Singapore’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 3.0% growth rate per worker, which is well above the global average, and a labor force growth
rate of 0.1% which will moderately boost growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Singapore’s productivity to be somewhat better than most
major countries (implying a growth rate of 4.0% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly better
than other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.6% on its own). As shown below, Singapore’s biggest relative
strengths are its rule of law and its level of bureaucracy, and its biggest relative problems are how hard its people
work and its debt and debt service levels. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual
indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and listed in the appendix of this section.

Further, people in Singapore don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average male of
working age works 34 hours per week (5 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are very
unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat high given Singapore's very high per capita income

Singapore's culture looks to be a significant support to growth in coming years, ranked 1 out of 20 countries in
this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Singapore to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Singapore is rated very well on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a strong work ethic, its level of government support is very low (with government outlays at 16% of
GDP), and its labor markets are very flexible. Singapore also seems to value achieving a bit more than savoring—
again, its work ethic is strong, and surveys suggest that its people value accomplishment and achievement.
Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Singapore relative to income. We see the
country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including
inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, relative to its income, Singapore has very low bureaucracy and red tape,
somewhat low corruption, and very strong rule of law, according to the international measures we are using.

Brazil's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Brazil's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the

economies, and 6 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like

growth rate of 0.6% which will boost growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness

works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Korea's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 14 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
253% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither
supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally neutral.

Russia
Russia's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Russia's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 1.6% to 1.7%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 9 out of 20 major
economies, and 8 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Russia’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 2.7% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat above the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of -0.9% which will weigh on growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Russia’s productivity to be somewhat better than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of 3.0% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be slightly worse than
other countries (implying a growth rate of 1.8% on its own). As shown below, Russia’s biggest relative strengths
are the value its workers provide relative to education levels and its debt and debt service levels, and its biggest
relative problems are how hard its people work and its reliance on credit flows for growth. The various gauges
and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study,
and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences that are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a
composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Russia offers somewhat better than average value, ranked 5 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
somewhat inexpensive, taking into consideration Russia's high levels of education and about average quality of
education. Further, people in Russia don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average
male of working age works 26 hours per week (11 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce
are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Russia's low per capita income levels,
with investment at about 13% of GDP (19 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Russia's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years, ranked 15 out of 20 countries in this culture
gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Russia to countries of similar levels of economic development.
Starting with self-sufficiency, Russia is rated pretty well on this measure, weighing that its workers have a
somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 35% of GDP),
and its labor markets are very flexible. Russia also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving—again, its
work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Russia relative to income. We
see the country investing lightly in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions
and earnings, are very low. Finally, relative to its income, Russia has somewhat high bureaucracy and red tape,
somewhat high corruption, and average rule of law, according to the international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than
is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Russia's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 13 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has a moderate amount of room to lever up in the future, with a total debt
burden of around 108% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth
was supported by high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally neutral.

United Kingdom's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that UK's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 1.6% to 1.7%. This growth rate is roughly at the global average, ranked 10 out of 20 major economies,
and 2 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In UK’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a 1.4%
growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.2%
which will moderately boost growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by productivity and
indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness tend to be an
important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our productivity
measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no precision here).
Over the next 10 years, we expect UK’s productivity to be somewhat worse than most major countries (implying
a growth rate of 0.8% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average compared to other countries
(implying a growth rate of 2.3% on its own). As shown below, UK’s biggest relative strengths are its monetary
policy and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and debt
service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual
indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and listed in the appendix of this section.

United States Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that USA's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the

and 3 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity

and its labor markets are moderately rigid. Australia also seems to value savoring about the same as it values
achieving—again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value
accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Australia
relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, though its outputs from
innovation, including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, relative to its income, Australia has somewhat low
bureaucracy and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law, according to the
international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than
is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Australia's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 19 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
355% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by
high credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally neutral.

Hungary
Hungary's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Hungary's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 1.4%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 13 out of 20 major
economies, and 9 out of 9 emerging countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Hungary’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 2.2% growth rate per worker, which is roughly in line with the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of -0.8% which will weigh on growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Hungary’s productivity to be about average compared to
most major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.7% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be better than
other countries (implying a growth rate of 3.3% on its own). As shown below, Hungary’s biggest relative
strengths are its monetary policy and the value its workers provide relative to education levels, and its biggest
relative problems are its debt and debt service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and
weights are shown below. The individual indicators that are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and
listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this table to understand our comments.

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences that are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a
composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Hungary offers around average value, ranked 10 among the countries we measure. Its workers are somewhat
inexpensive, taking into consideration Hungary's about average levels of education and poor quality of education.
Further, people in Hungary don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average male of
working age works 20 hours per week (16 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce are
unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are roughly average given Hungary's about average per capita income
levels, with investment at about 15% of GDP (11 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Hungary's culture looks to be a headwind to growth in coming years, ranked 16 out of 20 countries in this culture
gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Hungary to countries of similar levels of economic development.
Starting with self-sufficiency, Hungary is rated pretty poorly on this measure, weighing that its workers have a
weak work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 50% of GDP), and its labor
markets are very flexible. Hungary also seems to value savoring much more than achieving—again, its work ethic
is weak, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value accomplishment and achievement.
Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are somewhat weak in Hungary relative to income. We see the
country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including
inventions and earnings, are very low. Finally, relative to its income, Hungary has average levels of bureaucracy
and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat weak rule of law, according to the international
measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than

a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Hungary's indebtedness position is better than other countries, ranked 4 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
216% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was depressed by
low credit creation, which is supportive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally simulative.

France
France's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that France's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 0.4% to 1.0%. This growth rate is somewhat below the global average, ranked 14 out of 20 major
economies, and 5 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In France’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 1.0% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force
growth rate of 0.0% which will modestly impact growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly
by productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect France’s productivity to be much worse than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of -0.5% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average
compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.0% on its own). As shown below, France’s biggest
relative strengths are its monetary policy and its low reliance on credit flows for growth, and its biggest relative
problems are its debt and debt service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are

productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our

many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Japan's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years, ranked 7 out of 20 countries in this culture gauge.
Note that our culture measures compare Japan to countries of similar levels of economic development. Starting
with self-sufficiency, Japan is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a roughly
average work ethic, its level of government support is high (with government outlays at 40% of GDP), and its
labor markets are moderately flexible. Japan also seems to value savoring about the same as it values
achieving—again, its work ethic is roughly average, and surveys suggest that its people don't especially value
accomplishment and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Japan
relative to income. We see the country investing heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from
innovation, including inventions and earnings, are about average. Finally, relative to its income, Japan has average
levels of bureaucracy and red tape, somewhat low corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law, according to the
international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it
that you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than
is sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment
to future growth. Japan's indebtedness position is slightly worse than other countries, ranked 15 out of the 20
countries we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around
395% of GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither
supported nor depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of
monetary policy is generally stimulative.

Canada's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Canada's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in
the vicinity of 0.8% to 1.0%. This growth rate is well below the global average, ranked 17 out of 20 major
economies, and 8 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our
computer-generated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like
commodity or political shocks, or wars). In Canada’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our
expectation of a 0.7% growth rate per worker, which is well below the global average, and a labor force growth
rate of 0.1% which will modestly impact growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Canada’s productivity to be somewhat worse than most
major countries (implying a growth rate of 1.2% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be worse than other
countries (implying a growth rate of 0.7% on its own). As shown below, Canada’s biggest relative strengths are
its rule of law and its level of bureaucracy, and its biggest relative problems are its debt and debt service levels
and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are shown below. The individual indicators that
are behind them are explained in Part 1 of this study, and listed in the appendix of this section. Please review this

More Detail
As mentioned, the descriptions below are based on influences that are conveyed in gauges that are made up of a
composite of indicators, shown both in Part 1 and in the appendix. So, if you want to see why we are saying what
we are saying, you can trace them through by looking at those statistics.

Productivity
I.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
A country's productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value it offers, especially for its labor. As
shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as "what you pay versus what you get"; it reflects a) the cost
and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Canada offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 13 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
neither expensive nor inexpensive, taking into consideration Canada's somewhat high levels of education and
very good quality of education. Further, people in Canada don't work hard relative to the cost of their labor—the
average male of working age works 24 hours per week (13 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the
workforce are very unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Canada's high per capita
income levels, with investment at about 18% of GDP (7 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Canada's culture looks to be neutral for growth in coming years, ranked 9 out of 20 countries in this culture
gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Canada to countries of similar levels of economic development.
Starting with self-sufficiency, Canada is rated about average on this measure, weighing that its workers have a
somewhat weak work ethic, its level of government support is neutral (with government outlays at 40% of GDP),
and its labor markets are very flexible. Canada also seems to value savoring a bit more than achieving—again, its
work ethic is somewhat weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment and
achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are about average in Canada relative to income. We
see the country investing neither lightly nor heavily in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation,
including inventions and earnings, are low. Finally, relative to its income, Canada has somewhat low bureaucracy
and red tape, average levels of corruption, and somewhat strong rule of law, according to the international
measures we are using.

Indebtedness

GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was supported by high
credit creation, which is restrictive for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is generally
neutral.

Spain's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Spain's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the
vicinity of 0.2% to 0.7%. This growth rate is well below the global average, ranked 18 out of 20 major economies,
and 9 out of 11 developed countries. As a reminder, this estimate (and this writing) is based on our computergenerated analysis of the statistics detailed in Part 1, and doesn't account for exogenous shocks (like commodity
or political shocks, or wars). In Spain’s case, our growth estimate comes from combining our expectation of a
1.0% growth rate per worker, which is somewhat below the global average, and a labor force growth rate of 0.3% which will moderately weigh on growth. The growth in output per worker is driven significantly by
productivity and indebtedness. Over the long term, productivity matters most, while swings in indebtedness
tend to be an important driver in the short term. Given that we are looking at a 10-year time frame, we weigh our
productivity measures about two-thirds and our indebtedness measure about one-third (though there is no
precision here). Over the next 10 years, we expect Spain’s productivity to be much worse than most major
countries (implying a growth rate of -0.3% on its own), and indebtedness conditions to be about average
compared to other countries (implying a growth rate of 2.2% on its own). As shown below, Spain’s biggest
relative strengths are its low reliance on credit flows for growth and its monetary policy, and its biggest relative
problems are its debt and debt service levels and how hard its people work. The various gauges and weights are

Italy's Future Growth
Based on our economic health index, we project that Italy's real growth rate over the next 10 years will be in the

and value of employees and b) the levels of investment. Countries that have well-educated workers who are relatively
inexpensive and that have higher investment rates grow faster than those that don't.

Greece offers somewhat worse than average value, ranked 12 among the countries we measure. Its workers are
somewhat inexpensive, taking into consideration Greece's somewhat high levels of education and poor quality of
education. Further, people in Greece don't work especially hard relative to the cost of their labor—the average
male of working age works 21 hours per week (15 out of 20 countries), and the demographics of the workforce
are unfavorable. Levels of saving and investing are somewhat low given Greece's about average per capita
income levels, with investment at about 9% of GDP (20 out of 20 countries).

II.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country's workers misses the role that the culture plays in determining how much
a country will grow. As I've discussed, culture influences the decisions people make about factors like savings rates or how
many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously shown indicators, but culture can also influence work
attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such influences on whether countries underperform or outperform.

Greece's culture looks to be a significant headwind to growth in coming years, ranked 19 out of 20 countries in
this culture gauge. Note that our culture measures compare Greece to countries of similar levels of economic
development. Starting with self-sufficiency, Greece is rated very poorly on this measure, weighing that its
workers have a weak work ethic, its level of government support is very high (with government outlays at 52% of
GDP), and its labor markets are neither rigid nor flexible. Greece also seems to value savoring a bit more than
achieving—again, its work ethic is weak, and surveys suggest that its people moderately value accomplishment
and achievement. Furthermore, innovation and commercialism are very weak in Greece relative to income. We
see the country investing lightly in research and innovation, and its outputs from innovation, including inventions
and earnings, are very low. Finally, relative to its income, Greece has somewhat high bureaucracy and red tape,
very high corruption, and very weak rule of law, according to the international measures we are using.

Indebtedness
Think of debt growth that is faster than income growth as being like air in a scuba bottle—there is a limited amount of it that
you can use to get an extra boost, but you can't live on it forever. When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is
sustainable, but when debts can no longer be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process
works in reverse. You can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being
a support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the attractiveness of
taking on new debt.

The other major piece of our economic health index looks at the likelihood of debt being a support or detriment to
future growth. Greece's indebtedness position is worse than other countries, ranked 20 out of the 20 countries
we look at. The country has very little room to lever up in the future, with a total debt burden of around 312% of
GDP, compared to the global average of 200-250%. In the past few years, its growth was neither supported nor
depressed by credit creation, which is neutral for growth going forward. Lastly, the stance of monetary policy is
generally neutral.

Value: What You Pay Versus What You Get
As previously discussed, a country’s productivity and competitiveness are mostly a function of the relative value
it offers, especially for its labor. As shorthand for this, we refer to our gauge of this relative value as “what you
pay versus what you get”; it reflects a) the cost and value of employees and b) the levels of
investment. Countries that have well-educated workers that are relatively inexpensive and that have higher
investment rates grow faster than those that don’t.
To construct this gauge we first looked at the average cost of an educated worker, adjusted for the average hours
worked (including the average workweek, vacation time, and holidays) and adjusted for the quality of education
(based on international tests). We also created a gauge of the productivity-adjusted cost of labor (a spot picture
of how much workers offer relative to what you pay). And we created a gauge of working hard, where we look at
the portion of the population working, and then how many hours each of those workers puts in (again adjusting
for things like vacation). In addition, this gauge considers demographic shifts that change according to how
much that society is of working age relative to those who are very young or old and dependent. We weighted
these equally. This gives us perspective on the cost and value of employees. We also added in a gauge of
savings and investment that was also weighted equally. As shown in the correlations, all of these measures were
individually highly effective predictors of future growth, as was the aggregate of them. On its own this gauge is
67% correlated to future growth. Most interesting are the individual country rankings by measure, which are
shown in the charts that follow. We suggest picking a few countries that you are most interested in and seeing
where they stand in these rankings. As we progress through the charts in this section, clear pictures will emerge.

India and China rank at the top of our measure of whether a country is cheap or expensive. India’s work ethic is
very strong, and they’re investing a lot in their economy. And while their education scores in absolute terms are
not very strong, their income levels are low enough to more than compensate. Before adjusting for cost, China
scores better than India along most measures of what a country offers, but Chinese incomes have grown
considerably over the last two decades and India’s workforce is cheaper. Japan scores at the top of the developed
countries thanks to a well-educated workforce that is fairly cheap compared to other developed countries. Spain
rates better in the cut below, which doesn’t weigh cultural elements like Spanish attitudes toward savoring life
versus achieving and self-sufficiency. With labor that is expensive compared to workers of similar education
levels elsewhere, Germany and France are at the bottom of the list.

A Simple Measure of Cost: Per Capita Income
To make any assessment of value we want to look at the attributes of a country relative to their costs. Absent
other indications of productivity or indications of what you get for workers, we’d expect relative income levels
alone to give you some indication of a country’s relative future growth, albeit a naïve one. Through time,
countries with cheap workers and low skills can leverage existing technology to increase their productive ability.
Similarly, the richest countries generally do not continue to outperform the rest of the world, as their competitive
advantages are eaten away by technology transfers to less competitive economies, and the normal behavior of
most economies is to increasingly savor the fruits of success by working and investing less.
Our measure of cost simply compares the nominal GDP per capita of a given country relative to the developed
world average in log terms, which we believe is more reflective of the impact of differences in income levels.
That’s based on our intuition that, from a competitiveness perspective, a $2,000 difference is more meaningful
between one country that makes $500 and one that makes $2,500 than between countries that make $40,000
and $42,000. Again, this measure of cost is one side of the picture. We combine it with our assessment of
various indications of what a country offers to understand its productivity and competitiveness (what it offers
relative to its cost).
Today, India is by far the lowest-cost country in our sample. Indian per capita GDP is about $1,500, which is
much lower than that of many of the major developing world countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, or
Thailand. Even with its significant increase in cost in recent years, China’s cost is still one of the lowest in the
world, with per capita income of about $8,000, modestly below Mexico. However, the differences in cost by
area are significant, so that growth in China will largely depend on how development will occur in areas and with
people that are inexpensive. While developed world countries in general have high incomes, it’s worth noting
some differentiation between those countries—for example, GDP per capita in the poorest European countries
like Spain and Italy is quite a bit lower than per capita incomes of the richest developed countries, like the US and
Japan. You’ll see below that based on how we look at cost, we don’t make much of the difference in cost
between the developed countries—all are pretty expensive—but we believe there is a big difference between the
cheapest emerging countries, like India and China, and the rest (including other countries like Argentina and
Brazil).

Education: Cost of a Quality-Adjusted Educated Worker
Our single best measure of productivity is the relative cost of a country’s educated workforce adjusted for the
quality of that education. To construct our measure we look at the relative cost of different cohorts of educated
and uneducated workers (e.g., college, high school, those without education), allowing us to get closer to the
individuals where the competition occurs. We can then look at the average cost of those workers per hour
worked (adjusting for differences like vacation). Further, we take into account the quality of education in one
country versus another (e.g., if a high school graduate in the US costs the same as one in France, we also want to
ask whether the quality of high school education is the same in both countries). For this adjustment, we use an
internationally accepted measure of education quality.383 That allows us to compare for a given cohort the
relative quality of workers’ education compared to the relative cost. To come up with an aggregate measure for a
country we weight proportionally how much of its population is in each group because if a country’s workforce is
highly educated, then most of the labor competition happens with other countries at those levels (e.g., between
drug researchers in the US and their peers in Germany). Of course we recognize there is some labor arbitrage
across cohorts, but this approach lets us capture the dynamic reasonably well.
While there is, if anything, a negative relationship between a country’s level of education and its level of future
growth (because more expensive countries tend to have more educated people who are more expensive), there
is a high correlation between the relative cheapness of a country’s educated people and that country’s
subsequent growth rate. To convey how important it is to consider whether these educated people are expensive
or cheap, consider that while there is a -17% correlation between the average level of a country’s education and
its future growth rate, there is a +66% correlation between cost-adjusted education levels and a country’s future
growth rate.
We show our aggregate measure below on the right, next to our measure of education quality384 on its own for
perspective. Overall, India looks to have the most attractively priced educated population, followed by Russia,
with China and Mexico not far behind. Looking across education levels, workers in India with similar levels of
education cost a fraction of what their peers in the US cost (around 1/20th). When we adjust for the quality of
education in India being about 50% worse on average, the cost of a quality-adjusted worker in India is still about
1/10th that of a worker in the US. This isn’t all that different from how China’s workers looked 20 years ago.
Remarkably, even as wages in China have risen substantially, so too have education levels and the quality of
education—today the quality-adjusted cost of a worker in China is still highly attractive, though they have slipped
slightly below Russia on a cost basis in the last few years. Within the developed world, the US looks to have
some of the most attractive educated workers, despite the quality of a US high school education now being
worse than in other developed countries. In contrast, Europe’s educated labor appears to be the most expensive
in the world by this measure, even accounting for its good quality of education.

383

Our measure of education quality is based on the education quality measures of the OECD’s Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA). PISA’s assessments are designed to test the ability to apply knowledge rather than mastery of a specific curriculum. Our
aggregate measure takes into account PISA’s measures of education quality across mathematics, science, and reading. While we would not
put too much weight on the specific placement/ranking of a country, where countries place across the range is indicative. Seventy-two
countries participated in the most recent PISA section in 2015. The PISA surveys are designed in coordination with participating countries
and reviewed to minimize cultural bias. In some cases, as in China, recent assessments have only been conducted in a few cities, which we
make an adjustment for.

Below we take a more granular look at our measure for each cohort of education level, which we use to build up
to the aggregate picture. This approach gives us a much richer picture. For example, in the US college-educated
workers adjusted for quality are more expensive than college-educated workers in Spain. But at the high school
level and below, workers in the US are much cheaper than those in Spain. And since that’s where the
competition occurs between most workers for these countries, overall the US comes out more attractive. We
show below some other points we find interesting.

Both India and
Russia’s workers cost
a fraction relative to
the US, and India’s
workers are 2/3 the
cost of Russia’s when
adjusting for quality.
India’s workers are
least costly at higher
levels of education
(especially tertiary).

Cost of labor in the emerging world is less than half
the cost of the developed world, and least expensive
at lower education levels.

Less educated
workers in the US
appear much lower
cost than in the rest of
the developed world
(though less so than
in the past). European
labor looks especially
expensive at these
levels.

Cost of a Productivity-Adjusted Educated Worker
To triangulate our picture of the cost of an educated worker, we also look at the cost adjusting for observed
differences in productivity (output per hour worked) rather than education quality. With this measure, we take
the same approach of looking at the cost of the different cohorts. By adjusting for differences in observed
productivity today we can get a better sense of the effective cost. Imagine you hire two workers of the same
cost: one has a better education, but the other is more productive from day one on the job. This measure helps
us weigh that second perspective, though it is somewhat less correlated with future incomes than our qualityadjusted measures—about 57%. Our measures are below. The overall picture isn’t all that different. India looks
even stronger on this measure since their observed productivity is quite strong. In contrast, Japan falls lower
down.

Working Hard
Just like hardworking individuals, hardworking countries will generally be more productive and find ways to
improve faster than those that are less hardworking. We believe a country’s work ethic impacts both the level of
its relative advantage today and the pace at which it learns and improves over time. Working hard doesn’t just
mean working a lot of hours; it means having a certain ethic, a determination to achieve quality outcomes, and to
improve. Demographics can also impact the work ethic of a society—when a society ages and the number of
dependents rises relative to those in the workforce, it can impact the overall work ethic of the society. Similarly,
when there is a boom of young professionals, it can improve the vibrancy, initiative, and determination of the
society. We expect a country with a hardworking society that is low-cost to be more competitive and grow faster
than a country with a population that prefers leisure and is expensive.
To construct a simple measure of working hard, we look at two pieces: 1) average weekly hours of actual work by
men in the labor force, adjusting for things like vacation time and holidays, and 2) shifts in the amount of the
population as a whole that is working. While the number of hours worked is just one measure of the effort a
country puts in, and doesn’t account for the determination and effort put in during those hours, it gives us a
decent starting point; we return to some other measures that triangulate our picture when we look at culture.
This gauge, when income-weighted, has a 64% correlation with subsequent 10-year growth.
We look at our aggregate measure below first, followed by components. Emerging Asian workers are generally
the hardest workers in the world, including China, India, and Thailand. Mexico also stands out as particularly
hardworking. Among the richer countries, Singapore is by far the hardest working (competitive with much poorer
countries), and Japanese workers are some of the most hardworking of developed countries, followed by the
English-speaking developed countries. Continental European workers are generally the least hardworking in the
world. Adjusting for cost largely keeps these divergences in place, though India’s relative cheapness makes it
look more attractive.

Working Hard Subcomponent: Average Hours Worked
When looking at whether a country works hard, we look at the portion of the population working, and then how
many hours each of those workers puts in. Regrettably, we must look at this measure for just men in the labor
force because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort the numbers, and
we must adjust for things like labor force participation, vacation time, and holidays where data is limited.
When we look at hours worked on its own, Thailand, India, and China are at the top, with Mexico not far behind
and Singapore by far the hardest working of the wealthier countries. The Europeans work the least. Japanese
workers, who used to be among the very hardest working in the world, still rank well on this metric but are now
toward the middle. When we look at this measure of working hard adjusted for cost, we see some countries
really stand out on either end—the dollar cost of effort, if you will, is particularly attractive in India, and especially
bad in Europe.

Working Hard Subcomponent: Demographics
There is a natural cycle to how hard a person works and what they contribute, and typically one’s working years
are the hardest working and most productive ones. So it follows that societies go through long ebbs and flows in
terms of how hard they work in aggregate, based on how much of that society is of working age versus very
young or old and dependent.
Demographic pressures are measured by the projected change in the dependency ratio over the next 10 years.
This represents the projected rise or decline in the proportion of a country’s population that is young or old
relative to those of working age. Our expectation is that a rise in the proportion of dependents (e.g., elderly
individuals) would be a negative for the overall work effort in society and thereby for growth, all else equal.
In general, most countries in the world today—and particularly developed countries—are likely to see a drag on
their future growth in income per worker from these demographic shifts, due to aging populations. This impact is
particularly acute for Canada but significant for the US, Europe, the UK, and Japan as well. The picture is more
mixed in the emerging world. Demographic pressures are a support in India and Mexico but a drag in China,
Russia, and Korea due to their aging populations. Adjusting for cost levels exacerbates the negative picture for
the developed world. In the emerging world, India and Mexico are the two countries that stand out as having a
positive pressure after adjusting for cost; the pressure looks more muted in most of the rest, including China.

Investing
Countries that save and invest in their future tend to grow faster by creating capital equipment and infrastructure
that helps improve the productivity of their workforce relative to other countries with more limited investment
rates. Further, high rates of savings provide the capital needed to invest in the most innovative companies. Of
course, there are always risks that this investment is unproductive. Typically, the investments that yield the most
productivity gains occur in emerging countries that are just becoming rich. At this stage, the investments are not
just inexpensive; the stock of infrastructure and other physical capital is also typically low and there is lots of
room to adopt existing technologies that can radically improve the country’s potential.
Investing is measured by looking at 1) the rate of total non-residential fixed investment in a given economy and
2) the household savings rate. Looking at investing on its own has historically had a 20% correlation with future
growth, but when combined with cost it has had a 58% correlation with future growth.
The rate of Chinese investment and savings is the highest in the world, though increasingly inefficient. The
development of modern infrastructure and increasing business investment have been important contributors to
the productivity growth of the Chinese workforce over the last few decades—though an increasing share of this
investment is going to less productive uses. The UK, Germany, and the US are on the lower end of investing
rates for the developed world once adjusted for income. Argentina, Hungary, and Russia have some of the
lowest investment rates in the emerging world (with investment in Argentina and Hungary particularly
depressed and much of the investment in Russia oriented toward resources and related infrastructure). When
you consider how inexpensive it is to make investments in many emerging countries, how limited their existing
stock of capital is, and how early they are in adopting existing technologies, not to mention building their own,
India and China really stand out. On the flip side, we become more concerned about the US and the UK
maintaining their technology advantage when we consider their expense and their lower levels of investment.
(The innovativeness of countries is a question we return to in culture, and on that dimension both countries look
more promising.)

Investing Subcomponent: Aggregate Fixed Investment Rates
The impact of investing on long-term prosperity takes time to flow through, so when we look at investment rates
in a country we want to see what the trend has been, not just what happened recently. And we want to pay
attention to the level of investment rates, not the wiggles. Moreover, not all types of investment produce income.
While it’s hard to assess that well, one thing we know is that real estate investments are generally not
productivity enhancing, so we want to exclude those as best we can.
For these reasons, we measure the rate of investment for a given country by looking at the average level of fixed
investment as a percentage of GDP in the economy over the last seven years, stripping out residential real estate.
As highlighted above, on this measure China is ranked at the top. The US and Germany are below the cut—
investment levels in those countries stagnated for some time. The impact of adjusting for cost puts India at the
top just above China, and Germany and the US move closer to the bottom, with Japan modestly above them.

Investing Subcomponent: Household Savings Rates
Savings provide financing for investments, so measuring savings provides another perspective into the resources
a country has to productively invest. When you look at a country that is saving a lot when it is still poor, that is
the period when its savings typically yield the highest productivity gains, for the reasons we have explained.
Patterns of savings also relate to countries moving through the process described previously—countries that are
fast becoming rich tend to save a lot, and richer countries past their peak tend to draw down their savings.
We measure the propensity for households to save by looking at average household savings as a percentage of
household income over the last seven years.
Once again, China and India rank at the top for household savings. Major European countries measure as having
fairly high household savings rates relative to other developed countries, while household savings rates in the UK
and Japan are notably lower. Adjusting for cost levels again widens the differences between the emerging and
developed world along this dimension, with the high level of Indian and Chinese savings standing out and savings
rates in the US and Japan quite low.

Culture
Just looking solely at the relative value of a country’s workers misses the role that the culture plays in
determining how much a country will grow. As I’ve discussed, culture influences the decisions people make
about factors like savings rates or how many hours they work each week, which we measure in the previously
shown indicators, but culture can also influence work attitudes, levels of efficiency, reliability, and other such
influences on whether countries underperform or outperform. While some people shy away from examining
culture because it is perceived as a sensitive subject and/or difficult to measure, I think those views are
mistaken. I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t look at culture objectively as we do any other element of an
economy; also, it can be well measured. I think that it’s unfortunate that this important influence on economic
well-being has not been well studied.
To be clear, I don’t mean to judge whether a culture is good or bad any more than I could judge whether working
hard is a better way to live one's life than savoring the pleasures of life. I am, however, confident that people who
prefer savoring life over working hard will work and produce differently in ways that we should understand.
Similarly, it makes intuitive sense that countries that emphasize individual self-reliance and striving to achieve
are more likely to succeed than countries that don't. Countries can also outperform if the people in them are
more innovative in producing new products and ideas of value and are more commercially minded in harvesting
them. On the other hand, it makes sense that countries will underperform if they are corrupt, bureaucratic, or if
the rule of law is unsound. In this section we will look at the relationships between measures of such factors and
future growth, and we will examine how different countries stack up against these measures and what that
implies for their future growth rates.
Some additional observations worth noting are as follows: people in poorer countries typically appear to value
achieving because they need to work hard to sustain themselves, but as countries get richer, people tend to put
more emphasis on enjoying their success. On an individual level, people spend more time relaxing; nationally,
you can see it in countries turning away from policies that maximize growth toward policies that try to make
society more equal or protect the environment. There is a strong correlation between the quality of a system’s
institutions (whether the system works) and a country’s level of income. Similarly, richer countries seem more
innovative because they can afford to invest more in conducting research or educating researchers, and
developed capital markets in rich countries make it easier to start businesses and reap the potential rewards.
Our goal with the culture indicator is to capture the essence of whether a country’s culture is conducive to
growth, regardless of the influence of its stage of development. So, for each dimension of our culture gauge, we
take out the effect of income on that dimension (using income as a proxy for the country’s development stage).
For the reasons we have described above, the culture gauge focused on the elements of culture we believe
matter most for a country’s future growth: 1) self-sufficiency, 2) savoring life versus achieving, 3) whether its
society fosters innovation and commercialism, 4) bureaucracy, 5) corruption, and 6) rule of law. For simplicity,
we put equal weight on each of our culture indicators, which balances measures related to the motivations of the
individual and how the system operates. Because we took out the effect of income, each of the pieces is
correlated to growth without being correlated at all to the income level of the country. The table below
summarizes our weighting of the various gauges. Overall this gauge is about 62% correlated with future growth.

Again, the way we think about culture is that a country’s competitiveness and productivity are mainly a function
of its value proposition, but culture can be a drag or additional boost. So we use our gauge of culture to adjust
our measure of a country’s productivity by shifting it up or down based on whether the country’s culture is likely
to be a pressure for the country to perform above or below its potential.
In the following paragraph, we look at our culture indicator’s current readings before diving into its individual
pieces and describing our logic behind them in more depth.
Culture shifts our predictions for future growth some. Based on this gauge, culture is the strongest support to
growth in Asia, particularly in Singapore, India, Thailand, China, and Korea. Singapore’s culture is strong across
all four of our measures. In contrast, China’s institutions aren’t nearly as effective (due to bureaucracy and
corruption), but China’s culture shows an extremely strong work ethic, desire to achieve, and self-sufficiency.
For Korea, its orientation toward innovation and work ethic offsets relatively weak institutions. The US stands
just behind Korea, with a highly innovative spirit and achievement orientation, but with a system that prioritizes
redistribution over maximizing growth. Culture is a more moderate support in Japan, more neutral in the rest of
the English-speaking developed world and Germany, and a drag in Latin America and most European countries,
especially the periphery. In Europe’s periphery, corruption, a focus on savoring life, relatively low self-sufficiency,
and stagnant commercial and scientific environments appear to be material drags on growth. Russia and
Argentina, two of the countries where our measures of what you pay versus what you get are attractive, also
score near the bottom of the list because of corruption in Russia and low self-sufficiency and a high value on
savoring life relative to achieving in Argentina.

Self-Sufficiency
It is both logical and consistent with the evidence to believe that self-sufficiency (i.e., the need and the ability to
independently support oneself) is an important ingredient for individuals and societies to be successful. It is not
controversial to say that people spend the money that they earn differently than the money that others give
them—i.e., that the connection between earning and spending is a healthy one. If people have to earn money to
spend it, they have to be more productive. Over the long run, living standards rise as a function of increases in
productivity. So, it is not a big leap to presume that countries with greater amounts of self-sufficiency do better
than those with less. Since self-sufficiency creates capability and independence in addition to fostering
increased production, it also produces self-esteem. For these reasons, it is logical to conclude that self-reliance
is rewarding, both economically and psychologically. The evidence clearly shows this to be true.
Below, we show how self-sufficiency varies by country and how it has been correlated with subsequent economic
growth. You will see that there are significant differences in self-sufficiency levels between countries and that
these differences occur for different reasons. For example, in some cases they are chosen (e.g., the amounts of
transfer payments developed economies have are largely chosen) while in other cases they are not (e.g., high
self-sufficiency in the poorest societies is primarily the result of necessity rather than choice). Nonetheless, the
evidence is clear. Societies in which individuals are more responsible for themselves grow more than those in
which they are less responsible for themselves.
To measure self-sufficiency, we weighted 50% on how hard a society works and 50% on the system of supports
and protections, which is a function of the magnitude of government supports and how rigid labor markets are
(e.g., how easy it is to hire and fire). While no one of these perfectly measures self-sufficiency, together they
paint a picture that is highly indicative. Once we used the process below to construct a score, we took out the
role income plays in encouraging self-sufficiency and used the resulting measure in our culture indicator. Overall
our indicator of self-sufficiency is about 42% correlated to growth once you strip out the effect income has on
self-sufficiency.

The charts below convey those countries that are most self-sufficient today. As shown, Singapore and Thailand
are measured as most self-sufficient, followed by other Asian countries and Mexico. The US is in the middle, and
European countries are the least self-sufficient. The chart below shows these ratings. Look at it to see if you are
surprised and note those surprises so that you can see what they are attributable to when we show you the
composition of our barometer. For example, you might find it notable that “communist” China has greater selfsufficiency than the capitalist US. This is the case in both outright terms and once you adjust for income.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic
Societies that are self-sufficient have a high percentage of their population working hard each day to be selfreliant. People who work hard both produce more in the near-term and generally find ways to improve faster
through time than those that care more for leisure. They also tend to exhibit a drive to earn what they consume,
which is an essential quality of being self-reliant and generally successful in a market-based system.
While we think average hours worked accomplished our basic goal within productivity of getting a gauge of how
hard people worked, here we wanted to capture a little more richness about the work ethic of each country, so
we also looked at measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country
typically take male labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked and
labor force measures for just men because different social norms across countries on female participation in the
workforce distort the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is
one of the measures we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country’s income level.
When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India, Thailand, and
Mexico. Overall, emerging Asia and Latin America come through as working the hardest. Among rich countries,
Singapore and then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hardworking among developed countries,
whereas workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these measures. Once we
take into account the tendency for wealthier countries to take more leisure time, Japan really stands out as
exceptionally hardworking (as do Korea and Singapore). Brazil moves down a bit. Still, the relative ordering of
most countries is fairly stable since the differences in how hard each country works are fairly extreme. Any way
you cut it, Mexico and India remain among the hardest-working countries and workers in Europe some of the
most leisure-taking.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic—Average Hours Worked
Hard work is a sign that someone is driven to be self-reliant, that he or she has grit. This determination is
essential to having a society where self-sufficiency is promoted and rewarded. A simple way to see it is just by
looking at how many hours those who have a job put in. This gives us a sense of how hardworking the employed
members of a society are (and, more loosely, the society in aggregate). Below we zoom in on the simple
measure: the average work week (we triangulate our picture with a broader set of measures next). On this
measure we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including China, India, and Mexico. Overall, emerging
Asia comes through as working the hardest, followed by Latin America. Among rich countries, Singapore and
then Japan have the hardest workers. The US is fairly hardworking among developed countries (though Australia
comes out reasonably ahead), whereas workers in Europe opt for leisure more than anyone else based on these
measures.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic—Labor Force Participation
Remember, what we are trying to get at with this concept is the work ethic of a society, not just how much it is
actually working. Labor force participation is one indication (albeit crude) of how much a society wants to work.
It gives you a rough sense of what proportion of the society is actively looking for a job (though it may miss some
who have the drive but are in the informal economy). Because of cultural differences across countries and data
limitations, here again we are unfortunately limited to looking at male labor force participation. By and large the
emerging world has much higher male labor force participation rates than the developed world, though there are
exceptions. Brazil, Thailand, Mexico, India, and China have some of the highest rates (all around 80%). There is
still a high participation of men in the workforce in Singapore (above 75%), despite its wealth. Japan has a high
male labor force participation rate among developed countries (above 70%, though its female participation is
low compared to other developed countries). This measure is a bit lower in the US and UK. Labor force
participation is lowest among men in Western Europe, particularly Italy, France, and Greece (60% to 65%),
though Germany and Spain are not far behind, along with parts of Eastern Europe, especially Hungary.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic—Actual Vacation Time
How much vacation a society takes each year is just another intuitive measure of how much it values leisure
versus hard work and its rewards. When we look at this measure, the picture isn’t all that different from what we
have seen so far. Mexico and China are at the top of the list, with the average vacation time taken and holidays
adding up to around four weeks per year. The norm in the US is about four to five weeks. French and Spanish
workers appear to take some of the most vacation, with Italian and Greek workers not far behind. On average,
Europeans take seven to eight weeks of time off work per year.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Work Ethic—Retirement Age
One dimension of how hard you work is how many days you put in each year, but another is how long you work
over the course of your lifetime. To capture this we want to look at when people tend to retire in a society
relative to their life span. We measured this by looking at the effective retirement age as a percentage of life
expectancy. Interestingly, this picture shows some notable differences from the earlier patterns we saw and
appears less related to a country’s income (a simple measure of its stage of economic development). While the
countries at the top are mostly emerging, Japan and the US are in the middle of the pack. Japanese and US
workers appear to work over 80% or more of their life expectancy before retiring. On the other hand, workers in
China retire much earlier, working closer to 70% of their life expectancy before retirement. Consistent with
other measures, Europeans fall in the bottom half of this measure.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports
A country’s government policy both tells you something about what it values and also shapes the incentives and
motivations of its citizens. In general, societies that value self-reliance highly will provide less public support.
And large government supports, directly through transfers that redistribute incomes or indirectly through
services, are the primary means of enabling individuals to consume more than they earn. These supports risk
undermining self-reliance, which is such a fundamental value in a market-based system (i.e., the drive to earn
your keep). To be clear, we aren’t arguing for or against such payments; we are just measuring self-sufficiency
and, since this is one of the biggest influences on it, it is a significant part of our gauge. For these reasons, we
would expect countries that have fewer transfers, smaller welfare systems, and more limited social services to
grow faster than those that place a higher priority on redistribution and government safety nets.
We measure the degree of government supports in a society in a few ways, looking at the magnitude of its
outlays (which often include indirect transfers in the way of services, for example) and the magnitude of its direct
transfers to households.
As countries develop and get richer, they tend to weigh considerations like
redistribution more heavily, so this is another measure where we expect and find a fairly strong relationship
between the country’s income and its level of government supports, which we control for to account for the stage
of development the country is in and get a sense of the underlying ethic.
In our current rankings, Asia holds the top four spots, with European countries ranking as the least self-sufficient
along this measure. Once you exclude the effect of income, this pattern basically holds, though the developed
English-speaking world moves up some. Singapore ranks at the top, largely because its limited amount of
government support is unusual given the wealth of the country. Greece and France end up looking particularly
bad on this measure.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports—Government Expenditures
Government outlays are a broad indication of the support a government provides to those in society. While not
direct (as, say, pure household income transfers), many of these outlays are redistributive, providing, for
example, higher-value services than what a number of recipients contributed in the form of taxes. These
measures can both reflect societal attitudes around self-reliance and impact these values. On this measure, we
see that many of the emerging Asian countries have very small governments relative to the size of their
economies. Singapore’s government spends a bit over 15% of GDP, while China’s government has increased its
outlay but is still relatively high on the list at spending a little bit under 30%. India is a bit higher up in the top
quartile, with government spending around 25% of GDP. There is some variation among Latin American
countries, with Mexico’s government outlays close to India, and Argentina’s and Brazil’s governments around the
middle of the pack. Japan and the US are also in the middle. France and Italy are on the other end of the
spectrum. Their governments spend between 50% and 60% of GDP.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Government Supports—Transfers to Households
Household transfers are a direct subsidy and have an especially high risk of undermining self-reliance. The policy
highlights the trade-off of enforcing a market-based system to maximize growth versus risking slower growth to
achieve a different goal, like ensuring a social safety net for ethical reasons or for social stability. On this
measure, we see that Thailand and India’s governments are the least redistributive, by our measures. In both
countries, transfers to households are less than 5% of GDP. Transfers in the US and Japan are about four times
larger, around 20% of GDP, but still much lower relative to the rest of the developed world. In Western Europe,
transfers range from around 25% to over 30% in France.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity
Support from the state to an individual can happen through either direct transfer payments and the provision of
government services (as we examined above), or by regulating companies to provide workers with supports, e.g.,
enforcing a minimum wage or making it difficult to fire individuals. Unions and collective bargaining contracts
can also work to protect certain workers. To the extent that these structural labor market supports limit
companies from engaging with employees in a free manner (making hiring and firing decisions), it limits the need
for individual self-reliance. And this approach limits the dynamism of corporations and individuals to respond to
conditions—which over time should make countries with high rates of labor market rigidity grow more slowly.
We measure labor market rigidity by looking at collective bargaining coverage across countries, minimum wages,
and limits to hiring and firing at will in a given economy. Unlike hard work or government supports, these
measures tend to be fairly unrelated to a country’s wealth and stage of development (which we proxy with
income levels).
On our aggregate measure of labor force rigidity, Singapore, the US, and Russia rank as having the least rigid
labor forces, followed by Mexico. Italy and France score especially poorly along this measure. Since labor force
rigidity isn’t particularly related to a county’s stage of development, excluding income’s effect has little impact on
the rankings.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity—Collective Bargaining
While collective bargaining rights and union membership can help give workers a stronger voice in negotiations
with their employers, they also work to protect members from the pressure of other competitors in the workforce
and can restrict overall labor force participation—all of which undermines self-reliance. As with other measures
of labor market rigidity, collective bargaining rates have little relationship with the income of a country. The
measure shows different choices within countries of similar income. Collective bargaining coverage is low in the
US, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore (close to 15% and below), while coverage is very high in France, Italy, and
Spain (75% and higher).

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity—Ease of Hiring and Firing
Government protections that make it harder to hire or fire someone both increase the rigidity in the labor market
and reduce the self-sufficiency of its workers. Looking at ease of hiring/firing, the US and Singapore rate as some
of the most self-sufficient developed countries, and among the most self-sufficient of any country on this
measure. China is not far behind; still in the top quartile. Protections against firing appear to be high in Europe
and Latin America—Argentina, Brazil, France, and Spain are all in the lower half of the table.

Self-Sufficiency Subcomponent: Labor Market Rigidity—Minimum Wage
The minimum wage of a country is another indication of its labor market rigidity and emphasis on supports
versus market-based incentives and self-reliance. As with collective bargaining rates, we again see quite a bit of
difference across countries, even within the same income group. Russia and Mexico top the list, with the US and
Brazil not far behind. On the other end we see both developed countries, like Italy, and lower-income ones, like
Thailand and Argentina, which have much higher minimum wages as a percentage of incomes.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving
It makes intuitive sense to us that those who value achievement over savoring the fruits of life will be more
successful in finding ways to work harder and smarter to become more prosperous. Of course achievement
means different things to different people. When I talk about a society that values achievement I imagine one
where its people prioritize professional success, creating thriving businesses and building economic security
versus other goals like enjoying leisure. What’s more, these societies tend to be ones where there is a faith that
competition is fair and hard work will be rewarded (otherwise it’s less likely for the people to be motivated).
To calculate our “savoring life versus achieving” gauge we put 50% weight on the measures of whether the
culture values working hard and 50% on the values expressed in an international values survey. For the first
component (the evidence we see of work ethic in things like hours worked or vacation days), we draw on the
broad measure of working hard that we discussed as part of self-sufficiency. For the latter component, the
expressed values of society, survey data is difficult to compare across countries, so we triangulated with several
different questions that were consistent with our goal of capturing the desire of people to savor what they have
or focus on achieving more. For example, we used answers to questions like, “what should the first priority be for
the future of the country,” or “economic growth is more important than the environment,” to get at how people
value further success or economic growth in relation to other values (like the environment, people having more
say in their communities, etc.). We also look at questions about whether having a good time is important relative
to accomplishing and whether the respondent thinks it’s important to be successful, which are somewhat more
direct. Lastly, questions like “competition is harmful” help us get a sense of people’s attitudes toward the type of
environment that encourages people to push to achieve. These were combined into our overall indicator of the
relative preference for savoring life versus achieving in a way that is indicated by the weights shown below. As
with self-sufficiency, there is a natural tendency for people in less developed countries to value becoming more
prosperous through hard work and achievement, compared to developed countries, which are more inclined
toward leisure. Once we take into account the level of a country’s income, our indicator of savoring life versus
achieving is 37% correlated to growth.

When we look at the picture of which countries prioritize achievement over savoring, we see the familiar
countries at the top and bottom—Asia and the European periphery, respectively. India and China score as being
most focused on achieving. The most achievement-oriented countries in the developed world are the US, Japan,
and Singapore by these measures. European countries focus more on savoring life than most countries in the
world, with France and Italy at the bottom. The positions change some once we take into account the effect of
income, though not all that much (the differences between the extremes are also smaller). Singapore moves up
to the top spot—when you take into account how wealthy the country is, it’s remarkable how hardworking and
achievement-oriented its people appear by our measures. India still ranks toward the top after taking into
account its income level, but its relative achievement orientation stands out as less exceptional.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponent: Observed Outcomes
One straightforward way to see whether a society values achieving over leisure is to observe the outcomes of its
choices: literally how much effort they put into work. A society whose people strive hard to achieve in a marketbased system will likely have a more vibrant, competitive business environment. These traits will make it more
likely to improve its potential than an economy which chooses to value the fruits of life instead. Often we will see
countries that have acquired great wealth and become rich begin to make this choice.
For the observed piece of the concept of savoring life versus achieving, we use our broad measure of how
hardworking a country is. (As discussed, this is the same broad measure we use as part of self-sufficiency, so if it
is fresh in your mind you can skip down to the expressed values of this indicator.) As a reminder, this measure
includes a broad set of indications of a country’s work ethic, including not just the average hours worked, but also
measures like the typical retirement age, how many vacation days people in each country typically take, and male
labor force participation on its own. Again, regrettably we must look at our hours worked and labor force
measures for just men because different social norms across countries around women in the workforce distort
the numbers. Since we expect richer countries to take more leisure than poorer ones, this is one of the measures
we expect to have a fairly strong relationship with a country’s income level.
When we scan across countries, we see emerging countries at the top of the list, including India and Mexico.
Overall, emerging Asia and Latin America come through as working the hardest. Among more developed
countries, Singapore and then Japan have the hardest working people. The US is fairly hardworking, whereas
workers in Europe appear to opt for leisure more than anyone else, based on these measures.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponent: Expressed Values
Observing the outcomes of people’s choices is one way to see whether they value achievement over savoring;
another, of course, is to ask them. A World Values Survey asks several questions related to this topic:
respondents across many countries are asked whether they agree with statements, which help reveal their
attitudes towards hard work, competition, economic growth, etc. (listed in the table below). Naturally, there are
challenges comparing survey data across countries, but we believe that this data combined with the observed
outcomes above gives a pretty good picture of these differences in culture.
In fact, the rankings for the expressed component show a similar picture as those we observe in measures of
work effort. India and China top this gauge for the emerging world, and Latin America is further down the list. Of
the developed world, the US values achieving most, while Italy and France place the most emphasis on savoring
life. When you exclude the effect of income, the US moves to the top of achievement-oriented countries, with
India just behind.

The table below shows more specific information, which we triangulated to get a sense of the expressed values
toward achievement versus savoring in a given society. It’s interesting how the reasons for these cultural
attitudes differ across countries. For example, in Russia people express a lack of faith that hard work leads to
success, even though they express a desire for the country to grow, while in Canada people express a high value
on political input or environmental protection over economic growth. That said, we don’t want to make too much
of any one of these indications, since what we are trying to capture is the overall essence of whether a country is
achievement-oriented.

Innovation and Commercialism
An innovative and commercial spirit is the lifeblood of a thriving economy. The drive to tinker and invent, to
discover, to improve from prior failures—this is how people learn and find new and better ways of creating things
of value. In a market-based system, the most powerful way to drive innovation is to bring new ideas to market
and to commercialize and profit from them. The marketplace is generally efficient in weeding out the good ideas
from the bad and pricing which innovations are most valued by society. In this way, the concepts of innovation
and commercialism go hand in hand. They capture whether people in a society value finding new knowledge or
creating new things, and whether their incentives are aligned to encourage them to seek a profit by
commercializing these ideas. The following statistics measure the level of innovation and commercialism in
different countries and their correlations with future growth.
We looked at a variety of measures to triangulate these concepts. For both scientific and commercial innovation,
we wanted to have a balance between indicators that captured outputs (new inventions or businesses), and
indicators that measured inputs (values, investment, and people) that we thought would logically lead to
innovation. We weigh the inputs and outputs equally. The pieces of our innovation and commercialism indicator
are shown in the following table. Overall, the raw indications of innovation and commercialism are stronger in
higher-income countries, especially measures of investment (like R&D expenditure) that require a certain level of
resources, or measures of knowledge creation (like patent creation) that require a level of acquired
knowledge. What we are focused on with our culture measures, however, are the underlying values of a society
independent of its wealth and development stage (which we proxy in a simple way with income levels). Once we
exclude the effect of income, our gauge of innovation and commercialism is 65% correlated to historical future
growth in income per capita. It’s notable that before this adjustment there is no relationship between a country’s
future growth and the level of observed innovation and commercialism.

into these gauges relative to the number of people in the society or the size of the economy.

In terms of our ratings of countries on this gauge, the US and Korea rank as being the most innovative and
commercially-minded on an absolute basis and are still near the top after we take out the effect of income. Korea
invests a lot of capital and people toward research and has reaped the rewards in the form of a high number of
new patents and royalties. Along with relatively high investment in research, Americans stand out as highly
entrepreneurial. Germany and Japan aren’t far behind, each investing high amounts of R&D and researchers into
the innovation process and seeing the benefits from things like new patents, businesses, and websites. China is
roughly neutral on our measures on an absolute basis, but it jumps to second place once you take into account
the fact that its proportion of people creating new businesses and gross expenditure in R&D are fairly high given
how poor it still is. India is less innovative but it’s much poorer, so it moves ahead of China once you adjust for
the effect of income. Latin America and emerging Europe score in the middle to bottom end of the range whether
you adjust for the effect of income or not, especially Russia and Mexico. Once you adjust for income, Europe’s
periphery fares poorly, particularly Italy, which is at the bottom of the list. Mostly, their innovation and
commercial inputs like researchers or entrepreneurship prevalence are moderate, but those aren’t leading to the
scientific or business outputs you’d expect for countries at their income level.

Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Outputs
We would expect a country that has more innovative and commercially minded people to create more patents
and trademarks, more businesses—in other words, that it is actively creating new ideas, protecting its intellectual
property and capturing the rewards of this innovation. So we look at these outcomes as one way to get a sense of
the society’s innovative and commercial spirit. Some outcomes are more directly indicative of innovation (like
patent creation), others more direct signs of commercialism (like new businesses created or the prevalence of
entrepreneurs), and some show the signs of combining the two (like royalty fees).
When we look at these measures on their own, they are fairly related to a country’s income, which is intuitive
since rich countries tend to have more resources to invest and have higher levels of education and accumulated
knowledge, so are more likely to lead in creating innovations valued in the market. On the raw measures, you see
many poor countries at the bottom, like India or China (that might have a strong innovative spirit but you
wouldn’t expect to be leading innovators right now), behind rich countries, like France or Italy. But when we
adjust for income, both India and China move up a lot, especially India, which appears much more innovative.
Unlike in previous years, the US no longer ranks top once adjusted for income, coming below both cheaper
developing countries (China and India) and Korea. After taking out the effect of income, rich countries, like the
US and Japan still stand out as highly innovative. The European periphery countries (Greece, Spain, and Italy)
have the worst scores once you adjust for their higher incomes.

Innovation and Commercialism Subcomponent: Inputs
Ultimately what matters for commercial innovation is whether there is a strong spirit of finding new things and
building new businesses in the society. Whether a country is investing its resources in new innovations and
whether it has a culture of risk-taking are good signs this spirit is strong. So to measure the inputs to innovation
we look at human and capital investment through R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the proportion of
researchers in the population. We look at entrepreneurial spirit by examining whether people express a fear of
failing in a new business endeavor in surveys and whether there is a prevalence of entrepreneurs in the
population.
As with the outputs of innovation, the innovation inputs we measure are highly correlated to income—again, to
be expected since richer countries have more resources and higher levels of education to devote to finding new
ideas. To account for this and get at the underlying spirit of innovation and commercialism we simply take out
the effect of income. Here again we see India and China behind many rich countries on our raw indicators, and
then, at the top of the list, after taking into account their level of income; on the other hand, certain rich countries
are at the bottom of the list after excluding the effect of income—for example, Italy and France. As observed
when we looked at its score on our outcomes measure, Korea has the highest score for inputs to innovation and
commercialism. That’s because it devotes a high amount of spending and people to research while also having a
healthy amount of entrepreneurship (despite some apparent fear of business failure). Within the developed
world, the US, Japan, and Australia stand out as the countries most oriented toward innovation and
commercialism, near the top of all countries even when adjusted for income. Japan stands out because of the
resources it devotes—its level of researchers relative to its population and R&D expenditure—which outweigh an
apparent fear of business failure. The US, on the other hand, is strong on all measures, with a healthy willingness
to take risk.

Bureaucracy
Lots of red tape and government regulation stymie business activity. They impact the core elements of a thriving
economy by hindering people from innovating or creating new businesses, and they make running a business
burdensome, requiring people to spend time complying with unnecessary or heavy administrative controls
instead of focusing on business improvements. That’s not to say that regulation is not important—of course,
good governance and the rule of law are critical to a healthy market-based economy, as we will examine
next. But excessive, time-consuming, and rigid controls gum up the wheels of the economy.
To measure bureaucracy we look at measures related to the ease of starting a business (from the World
Bank/IFC), the efficiency and cost of dealing with construction permits (also World Bank/IFC), and the burden of
government regulation (from the World Economic Forum). The pieces of our bureaucracy indicator are shown in
the table below. Bureaucracy tends to be more prevalent in less developed countries and so is fairly related to
income levels. This is fairly natural for a number of reasons, because the processes are simply less efficient and
require more steps, because the market systems are less advanced or established and have more controls, or
because of inter-related factors, like weaker rule of law and a higher degree of corruption leading to more controls
that allow for rent-seeking. From a growth perspective, businessmen and investors will likely accept that a
certain degree of bureaucracy is to be expected to do business in an emerging country that is otherwise
competitive. But if the bureaucracy is exceptional even relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going
to weigh on the decision to do business in that country. Once excluding the effect of income, our gauge of
bureaucracy is 43% correlated to historical future growth in income per capita. Notably, it is negatively
correlated to future growth when we don’t make this adjustment. Along with our measures of the rule of law and
corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore ranks best on our gauge of bureaucracy, followed by the
English-speaking developed world. Nowhere is it easier to start a business or run one without burden from
government regulation than in Singapore according to our measures. Bureaucracy is worst in Brazil and India and
high in Argentina, Russia, and China as well. Once you exclude the relationship between income and bureaucracy,
India and China don’t look quite as bad, though India is still below par. Europe’s periphery (Spain, Greece, and
Italy) all look highly bureaucratic given their stage of development. Italy ranks near the bottom due, in particular,
to the burden government regulations place on doing business. Russia scores poorly considering its income, just a
touch above Argentina.

Corruption
Corruption undermines the effectiveness of a market-based system in a variety of ways, diverting resources,
distorting incentives, raising the costs of doing business, undermining business competition and efficiency, and
creating uncertainty for investment. Corruption also both discourages profit-seeking and often impedes it. Small
types of corruption (like the bribes one may have to pay at the airport or to an administrative official) create
inefficiencies that slow down the agility of businesses, raise costs, and make it more difficult to cultivate a new
business. Big forms of corruption (for example, business appropriation) create limits to financial success and
others (like large bribes to enter an industry or win a license) create entry barriers and lower prospective returns.
All forms can make a country’s system dysfunctional and create uncertainty around doing business in a given
country. In all these ways corruption undermines productivity and the capacity of a society to realize its potential.
To measure corruption, we combine Transparency International’s measures of corruption across countries with
three sub-indices from the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness index: “diversion of public funds,” “irregular
payments and bribes,” and “favoritism in decisions of government officials.” These measures help us capture the
different types of corruption (big and small). The pieces of our corruption indicator are shown in the table below.
When we look at these measures we see that poorer countries tend to have higher degrees of corruption. That’s
for a number of reasons we won’t explore in depth here, including fewer opportunities for wealth creation,
entrenched ways of operating that may have once been part of a different, non-market based system, or weaker
rule of law. Businessmen and investors will likely put up with a certain degree of corruption to operate in an
emerging country that is otherwise competitive. But if that country has an exceptionally high degree of corruption
relative to countries of similar income, it is no doubt going to weigh on the decision to do business in that country.
Excluding the effect of income, our gauge of corruption is 63% correlated to historical future growth in income
per capita. Notably, the relationship is slightly negative without this adjustment. Along with our measures of
bureaucracy and the rule of law, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a
country.

Before taking into account the income level of countries, Singapore again looks best, with Japan, the Englishspeaking developed world, and Germany also near the top. Most emerging countries are toward the bottom of
our rankings, which is to be expected given the relationship between corruption and income levels we have
discussed. When we exclude how income levels are related to corruption, the European periphery is at the
bottom of our ratings. Italy and Greece stand out as having the highest degree of corruption of any of the
countries we look at, followed by Argentina and Russia just behind. Italy is weak across all measures, especially
given how wealthy it is, and particularly with regard to favoritism by government officials. India and China both
face significant impediments from their levels of corruption. But when we consider their levels of corruption
relative to their levels of income, their corruption is not exceptional; in fact, it’s lower than we would expect, with
India having significantly lower corruption than any other country on an income-adjusted basis. Even after
considering income levels, many developed countries still rate high, Singapore in particular, but also
commonwealth countries, Japan, and Germany. The US rates in the bottom third after considering its income.

Rule of Law
A strong rule of law helps ensure fair competition in a market-based system and it protects the incentives and
efficiency of this system. When a country’s legal system can reliably and efficiently enforce agreements that
businesses make and protect people’s property and investments, the economy can function. If there are strong
disagreements, a contract broken, or a bankruptcy, a well-developed legal system makes working these things
out fair and orderly. When the government fails to do these things, investing and doing business in a country is a
lot riskier and inefficient. A strong rule of law also helps stamp out corruption and other activities that discourage
profit seeking and prevent the most highly valued products and businesses from thriving.
We measure rule of law by combining measures related to the efficiency of the legal framework in settling
disputes (WEF), property rights (WEF), protecting investors (World Bank/IFC), and enforcing contracts (World
Bank/IFC). The pieces of our rule of law indicator are shown in the table below. As with our measures of
corruption and bureaucracy, the rule of law tends to be strongly related to a country’s income. Again, we won’t
delve into all the reasons here, but it’s intuitive that countries that have less resources and less educated
populations have more immature legal systems, and the rule of law is likely compounded by interrelated factors,
like higher corruption. Here we want to look at the rule of law of a country taking into account its development
stage. That gives us a better sense of the underlying cultural elements that will determine its lawfulness as it
develops. It’s also a more helpful perspective in looking at future growth. As with our measures of bureaucracy
and corruption, we would expect that businessmen and investors will likely expect there to be lower rule of law in
poorer countries, and so it may not impact their decision to do business or invest in an emerging country that is
otherwise competitive. But if the rule of law is particularly weak in that country relative to others of similar
income, that is likely a drag. Indeed, we see no relationship between the rule of law on its own and future growth.
But once we exclude the effect of income, our gauge of the rule of law is 59% correlated to historical future
growth in income per capita. In other words, when countries still fail to uphold the rule of law once they are rich,
their cultures often appear to be holding back their growth. Along with our measures of bureaucracy and
corruption, this gauge helps us triangulate the picture of how hard it is to do business in a country.

Before taking into account income levels, Singapore, Japan, and the English-speaking developed world are at the
top of our ranking. Despite its wealth and development stage, Italy ranks near the bottom of the list, just ahead of
Argentina. Emerging countries also tend to perform poorly on this measure. Once we exclude the effect of
income, Italy and Greece stand out as having an especially weak rule of law. In general, the European periphery
and Latin American countries rate toward the bottom, with the rest of the developed world and emerging Asian
countries toward the top. Singapore stays at the top even after taking out income, along with other rich
nations. The US and Japan have a rule of law rating that is just modestly strong given their levels of income.

Important Disclosures
Information contained herein is only current as of the printing date and is intended only to provide the observations and views of Bridgewater
Associates, L.P. (“Bridgewater”) as of the date of writing without regard to the date on which the recipient may receive or access the
information. Bridgewater has no obligation to provide recipients hereof with updates or changes to the information contained herein.
Performance and markets may be higher or lower than what is shown herein and the information, assumptions and analysis that may be time
sensitive in nature may have changed materially and may no longer represent the views of Bridgewater. Statements containing forwardlooking views or expectations (or comparable language) are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and are informational in nature.
Actual performance could, and may have, differed materially from the information presented herein. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

HYPOTHETICAL OR SIMULATED PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE AN ACTUAL
PERFORMANCE RECORD, SIMULATED RESULTS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL TRADING OR THE COSTS OF MANAGING THE
PORTFOLIO. ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS MAY HAVE UNDER OR OVER
COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED TRADING
PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. NO
REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE
SHOWN.
Bridgewater research utilizes (in whole and in part) data and information from public, private, and internal sources. Some internally generated
information, such as internally constructed market series, may be considered theoretical in nature and subject to inherent limitations
associated therein, including but not limited to, an ability to find appropriate inputs. External sources include International Energy Agency,
Investment Management Association, International Monetary Fund, National Bureau of Economic Research, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, United Nations, US Department of Commerce, World Bureau of Metal Statistics, World Economic Forum, as well
as information companies such as BBA Libor Limited, Bloomberg Finance L.P., CEIC Data Company Ltd., Consensus Economics Inc., Credit
Market Analysis Ltd., Ecoanalitica, Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, Inc., Global Financial Data, Inc., Global Trade Information Services, Inc.,
Markit Economics Limited, Mergent, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc., MSCI, RealtyTrac, Inc., RP Data Ltd., SNL Financial LC, Standard and Poor’s,
Thomson Reuters, TrimTabs Investment Research, Inc. and Wood Mackenzie Limited. While we consider information from external sources
to be reliable, we do not independently verify information obtained from external sources and we make no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy, completeness or reliability of such information.
The views expressed herein are solely those of Bridgewater and are subject to change without notice. You should assume that Bridgewater
has a significant financial interest in one or more of the positions and/or securities or derivatives discussed. Bridgewater’s employees may
have long or short positions in and buy or sell securities or derivatives referred to in this material. Those responsible for preparing this
material receive compensation based upon various factors, including, among other things, the quality of their work and firm revenues.
This material is for informational and educational purposes only and is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities or
other instruments mentioned. Any such offering will be made pursuant to a definitive offering memorandum. This material does not
constitute a personal recommendation or take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual
investors which are necessary considerations before making any investment decision. Investors should consider whether any advice or
recommendation in this research is suitable for their particular circumstances and, where appropriate, seek professional advice, including
legal, tax, accounting, investment or other advice.
The information provided herein is not intended to provide a sufficient basis on which to make an investment decision and investment
decisions should not be based on simulated, hypothetical or illustrative information that have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual
performance record, simulated or hypothetical results do not represent actual trading or the actual costs of management and may have under
or over compensated for the impact of certain market risk factors. Bridgewater makes no representation that any account will or is likely to
achieve returns similar to those shown. The price and value of the investments referred to in this research and the income therefrom may
fluctuate.
Every investment involves risk and in volatile or uncertain market conditions, significant variations in the value or return on that investment
may occur. Investments in hedge funds are complex, speculative and carry a high degree of risk, including the risk of a complete loss of an
investor’s entire investment. Past performance is not a guide to future performance, future returns are not guaranteed, and a complete loss of
original capital may occur. Certain transactions, including those involving leverage, futures, options, and other derivatives, give rise to
substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. Fluctuations in exchange rates could have material adverse effects on the value or price
of, or income derived from, certain investments.
This information is not directed at or intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity located in any jurisdiction where such
distribution, publication, availability or use would be contrary to applicable law or regulation or which would subject Bridgewater to any
registration or licensing requirements within such jurisdiction.

EmailRay Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, discusses how the economy machine really works. Note: this is the transcript only for educational and &#8216;ideas worth spreading&#8217; purposes.&nbsp;TRANSCRIPT: Ray Dalio &#8211; Founder, Bridgewater AssociatesHow the economic machine works, in 30 minutes.The economy works like a simple machine. But many people don&#8217;t understand it — or they don&#8217;t agree on how it works. And this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template. Though it&#8217;s unconventional, it has helped me to anticipate and sidestep the global financial crisis, and has worked well for me for over 30 years.Let&#8217;s begin.Though the economy might seem complex, it works in a simple, mechanical way. It&#8217;s made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a zillion times. These transactions are above all else driven by human nature, and they create 3 main forces that drive the economy.Number 1: Productivity growthNumber 2: The Short term debt cycleAnd Number 3: The Long term debt cycleWe&#8217;ll look at these three forces and how laying them on top of each other creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what&#8217;s happening now.TransactionsLet&#8217;s start with the simplest part of the economy: Transactions.An economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing. You make transactions all the time. Every time you buy something you create a transaction. Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods, services or financial assets. Credit spends just like money, so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent, you can know the total spending.The total amount of spending drives the economy.If you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the price. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s a transaction. It is the building block of the economic machine. All cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions.So, if we can understand transactions, we can understand the whole economy. A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market, a car market, a stock market and markets for millions of things. An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets.If you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in all of the markets, you have everything you need to know to understand the economy. It&#8217;s just that simple. People, businesses, banks and governments all engage in transactions the way I just described: exchanging money and credit for goods, services and financial assets.The biggest buyer and seller is the government, which consists of two important parts: a Central Government that collects taxes and spends money&#8230;and a Central Bank, which is different from other buyers and sellers because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy. It does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money.For these reasons, as we&#8217;ll see, the Central Bank is an important player in the flow of Credit. I want you to pay attention to credit. Credit is the most important part of the economy, and probably the least understood. It is the most important part because it is the biggest and most volatile part. Just like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions, so do lenders and borrowers.Lenders usually want to make their money into more money and borrowers usually want to buy something they can&#8217;t afford, like a house or car or they want to invest in something like starting a business. Credit can help both lenders and borrowers get what they want.Borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow, called the principal, plus an additional amount, called interest. When interest rates are high, there is less borrowing because it&#8217;s expensive. When interest rates are low, borrowing increases because it&#8217;s cheaper. When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created.Any two people can agree to create credit out of thin air! That seems simple enough but credit is tricky because it has different names. As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower.In the future, when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest, the asset and liability disappear and the transaction is settled.So, why is credit so important? Because when a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending. And remember, spending drives the economy. This is because one person&#8217;s spending is another person&#8217;s income.Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns. And every dollar you earn, someone else has spent. So when you spend more, someone else earns more. When someone&#8217;s income rises it makes lenders more willing to lend him money because now he&#8217;s more worthy of credit.A creditworthy borrower has two things: the ability to repay and collateral. Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay. In the event that he can&#8217;t repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold. This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money.So increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending. And since one person&#8217;s spending is another person&#8217;s income, this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have Cycles.In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get something and how much you get depends on how much you produce. Over time we learn and that accumulated knowledge raises our living standards, we call this productivity growth.Those who were inventive and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy, but that isn&#8217;t necessarily true over the short run. Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run. This is because productivity growth doesn&#8217;t fluctuate much, so it&#8217;s not a big driver of economic swings. Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back.Debt swings occur in two big cycles. One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years. While most people feel the swings, they typically don&#8217;t see them as cycles because they see them too up close &#8212; day by day, week by week.In this chapter we are going to step back and look at these three big forces and how they interact to make up our experiences..u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e:active, .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u4c346c47778f593a0de6670162bcba4e:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; BAE Systems' (BAESY) CEO Ian Graham King on Q2 2014 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptAs mentioned, swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is, they&#8217;re primarily due to how much credit there is. Let&#8217;s for a second imagine an economy without credit.In this economy, the only way I can increase my spending is to increase my income, which requires me to be more productive and do more work. Increased productivity is the only way for growth. Since my spending is another person&#8217;s income, the economy grows every time I or anyone else is more productive. If we follow the transactions and play this out, we see a progression like the productivity growth line.But because we borrow, we have cycles. This isn&#8217;t due to any laws or regulation, it&#8217;s due to human nature and the way that credit works. Think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward. In order to buy something you can&#8217;t afford, you need to spend more than you make. To do this, you essentially need to borrow from your future self.In doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back. It very quickly resembles a cycle. Basically, anytime you borrow you create a cycle. This is as true for an individual as it is for the economy. This is why understanding credit is so important because it sets into motion a mechanical, predictable series of events that will happen in the future. This makes credit different from money.Money is what you settle transactions with. When you buy a beer from a bartender with cash, the transaction is settled immediately. But when you buy a beer with credit, it&#8217;s like starting a bar tab. You&#8217;re saying you promise to pay in the future. Together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability. You just created credit. Out of thin air. It&#8217;s not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and liability disappear, the debt goes away and the transaction is settled.The reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit. The total amount of credit in the United States is about $50 trillion and the total amount of money is only about $3 trillion. Remember, in an economy without credit: the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. But in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. As a result, an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run.Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; credit isn&#8217;t necessarily something bad that just causes cycles. It&#8217;s bad when it finances over-consumption that can&#8217;t be paid back. However, it&#8217;s good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income so you can pay back the debt. For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV, it doesn&#8217;t generate income for you to pay back the debt. But, if you borrow money to buy a tractor — and that tractor lets you harvest more crops and earn more money — then, you can pay back your debt and improve your living standards.In an economy with credit, we can follow the transactions and see how credit creates growth. Let me give you an example: Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt. You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000, say, on a credit card. So you can spend $110,000 even though you only earn $100,000.Since your spending is another person&#8217;s income, someone is earning $110,000. The person earning $110,000 with no debt can borrow $11,000, so he can spend $121,000 even though he has only earned $110,000. His spending is another person&#8217;s income and by following the transactions we can begin to see how this process works in a self-reinforcing pattern.But remember, borrowing creates cycles and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle.As economic activity increases, we see an expansion &#8211; the first phase of the short term debt cycle. Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit which can be created instantly out of thin air.When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods: prices rise. When prices rise, we call this inflation.The Central Bank doesn&#8217;t want too much inflation because it causes problems. Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money. And the cost of existing debts rises. Think about this as the monthly payments on your credit card going up. Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments, they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows&#8230;and since one person&#8217;s spending is another person&#8217;s income, incomes drop&#8230;and so on and so forth.When people spend less, prices go down. We call this deflation. Economic activity decreases and we have a recession. If the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again. With low interest rates, debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another expansion.As you can see, the economy works like a machine. In the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there&#8217;s an economic expansion. When credit isn&#8217;t easily available, there&#8217;s a recession. And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank.The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 to 8 years and happens over and over again for decades.But notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt. Why? Because people push it, they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It&#8217;s human nature. Because of this, over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes creating the Long Term Debt Cycle.Despite people becoming more indebted, lenders even more freely extend credit. Why? Because everyone thinks things are going great! People are just focused on what&#8217;s been happening lately.And what has been happening lately? Incomes have been rising! Asset values are going up! The stock market roars! It&#8217;s a boom! It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets with borrowed money! When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble. So even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them. Let&#8217;s call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden..u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d:active, .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u793b6f7d660865a87e989f9acd4d9d6d:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; Transcript of An Evening with Professor Jeffrey D. SachsSo long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. At the same time asset values soar. People borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher. People feel wealthy. So even with the accumulation of lots of debt, rising incomes and asset values help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time. But this obviously cannot continue forever. And it doesn&#8217;t.Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments. At some point, debt repayments start growing faster than incomes forcing people to cut back on their spending. And since one person&#8217;s spending is another person&#8217;s income, incomes begin to go down&#8230;which makes people less creditworthy causing borrowing to go down.Debt repayments continue to rise which makes spending drop even further&#8230; and the cycle reverses itself. This is the long term debt peak. Debt burdens have simply become too big.For the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world this happened in 2008. It happened for the same reason it happened in Japan in 1989 and in the United States back in 1929. Now the economy begins Deleveraging.In a deleveraging, people cut spending, incomes fall, credit disappears, assets prices drop, banks get squeezed, the stock market crashes, social tensions rise and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way.As incomes fall and debt repayments rise, borrowers get squeezed. No longer creditworthy, credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments. Scrambling to fill this hole, borrowers are forced to sell assets. The rush to sell assets floods the market, at the same time spending falls. This is when the stock market collapses, the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble.As asset prices drop, the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops. This makes borrowers even less creditworthy. People feel poor. Credit rapidly disappears. Less spending › less income › less wealth › less credit › less borrowing and so on. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle. This appears similar to a recession but the difference here is that interest rates can&#8217;t be lowered to save the day.In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate borrowing. However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn&#8217;t work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% &#8211; so the stimulation ends. Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging of the 1930s and again in 2008.The difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging, borrowers&#8217; debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can&#8217;t be relieved by lowering interest rates. Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back. Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value. They feel crippled by the debt &#8211; they don&#8217;t even want more!Lenders stop lending. Borrowers stop borrowing. Think of the economy as being not-creditworthy, just like an individual. So what do you do about a deleveraging? The problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down.There are four ways this can happen. One, people, businesses, and governments cut their spending. Two, debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings. Three, wealth is redistributed from the &#8216;haves&#8217; to the &#8216;have nots&#8217;. 4and finally, four, the central bank prints new money.These 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history. Usually, spending is cut first. As we just saw, people, businesses, banks and even governments tighten their belts and cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt. This is often referred to as austerity. When borrowers stop taking on new debts, and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease.But the opposite happens! Because spending is cut &#8212; and one man&#8217;s spending is another man&#8217;s income &#8211; it causes incomes to fall. They fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse. As we&#8217;ve seen, this cut in spending is deflationary and painful. Businesses are forced to cut costs&#8230;which means less jobs and higher unemployment. This leads to the next step: debts must be reduced!Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans — and a borrower&#8217;s debts are a lender&#8217;s assets. When borrowers don&#8217;t repay the bank, people get nervous that the bank won&#8217;t be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank. Banks get squeezed and people, businesses and banks default on their debts. This severe economic contraction is a depression.A big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought was their wealth isn&#8217;t really there. Let&#8217;s go back to the bar.When you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab, you promised to repay the bartender. Your promise became an asset of the bartender. But if you break your promise &#8211; if you don&#8217;t pay him back and essentially default on your bar tab &#8211; then the &#8216;asset&#8217; he has isn&#8217;t really worth anything. It has basically disappeared. Many lenders don&#8217;t want their assets to disappear and agree to debt restructuring. Debt restructuring means lenders get paid back less or get paid back over a longer time frame or at a lower interest rate than was first agreed.Somehow a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt. Lenders would rather have a little of something than all of nothing. Even though debt disappears, debt restructuring causes income and asset values to disappear faster, so the debt burden continues to gets worse.Like cutting spending, debt reduction is also painful and deflationary. All of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government collects fewer taxes. At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen. Many of the unemployed have inadequate savings and need financial support from the government.Additionally, governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy. Governments&#8217; budget deficits explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes. This is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news.To fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money. But with incomes falling and so many unemployed, who is the money going to come from? The rich.Since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people, governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy &#8211; from the &#8216;haves&#8217; to the &#8216;have nots&#8217;. The &#8216;have-nots,&#8217; who are suffering, begin to resent the wealthy &#8216;haves.&#8217; The wealthy &#8216;haves,&#8217; being squeezed by the weak economy, falling asset prices, higher taxes, begin to resent the &#8216;have nots.&#8217;.u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c:active, .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u73c9dd5fb03876c8720ed824f8f5b27c:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; Transcript of Ray Dalio’s Interview on The All-In PodcastIf the depression continues social disorder can break out. Not only do tensions rise within countries, they can rise between countries &#8211; especially debtor and creditor countries. This situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme.In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power, war in Europe, and depression in the United States. Pressure to do something to end the depression increases. Remember, most of what people thought was money was actually credit. So, when credit disappears, people don&#8217;t have enough money. People are desperate for money and you remember who can print money? The Central Bank can.Having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0 it&#8217;s forced to print money. Unlike cutting spending, debt reduction, and wealth redistribution, printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bank prints new money out of thin air — and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds. It happened in the United States during the Great Depression and again in 2008, when the United States&#8217; central bank — the Federal Reserve — printed over two trillion dollars. Other central banks around the world that could, printed a lot of money, too.By buying financial assets with this money, it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy. However, this only helps those who own financial assets. You see, the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets.The Central Government, on the other hand, can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can&#8217;t print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two must cooperate. By buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the government, allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus programs and unemployment benefits. This increases people&#8217;s income as well as the government&#8217;s debt.However, it will lower the economy&#8217;s total debt burden. This is a very risky time. Policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt burdens come down.The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability. If balanced correctly, there can be a Beautiful Deleveraging.You see, a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful. How can a deleveraging be beautiful? Even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation, handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful. A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase.In a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive, and inflation isn&#8217;t a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance. The right balance requires a certain mix of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained. People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won&#8217;t if it offsets falling credit.Remember, spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar of spending paid for with credit. By printing money, the Central Bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money. In order to turn things around, the Central Bank needs to not only pump up income growth but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt.So, what do I mean by that? Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example: let&#8217;s assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-income ratio of 100%. That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year.Now think about the interest rate on that debt, let&#8217;s say it is 2%. If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and income is only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden. You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the rate of interest. However, printing money can easily be abused because it&#8217;s so easy to do and people prefer it to the alternatives.The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920&#8217;s. If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn&#8217;t so dramatic. Growth is slow but debt burdens go down. That&#8217;s a beautiful deleveraging.When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy. And when borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders begin to lend money again. Debt burdens finally begin to fall. Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to grow again, leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle.Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly; if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem. It takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal &#8211; hence the term &#8216;lost decade.&#8217;In closingOf course, the economy is a little more complicated than this template suggests. However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we&#8217;ve been, where we are now and where we are probably headed.So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I&#8217;d like you to take away from this:First: Don&#8217;t have debt rise faster than income, because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.Second: Don&#8217;t have income rise faster than productivity, because you will eventually become uncompetitive.And third: Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because, in the long run, that&#8217;s what matters most.This is simple advice for you and it&#8217;s simple advice for policy makers.You might be surprised but most people — including most policy makers — don&#8217;t pay enough attention to this. This template has worked for me and I hope that it&#8217;ll work for you.Thank you.Related PostsIs Your Business Organized Poorly?

EmailRead the full transcript of Ray Dalio’s interview on AI, Job Loss &amp; the Future of the Economy (EP #148) on Moonshots with Peter Diamandis, Feb 3rd, 2025.TRANSCRIPT: IntroductionPETER DIAMANDIS: Everybody, welcome to Moonshots. Today my guest is none other than Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, the world&#8217;s largest hedge fund with $130 billion under management. I asked Ray about why he holds gold over Bitcoin, the impact of AI and robotics on the global economy and on the US Economy. His advice for entrepreneurs, building tech companies. Over the next one to two years, we&#8217;ll talk about China and we&#8217;ll talk about the world ahead. It&#8217;s a fascinating conversation with one of the smartest thinkers ever, particular on his new book How Countries Go Broke. And being in the United States, I want to know what&#8217;s the impact on me and you as an entrepreneur? Let&#8217;s dive in. Ray, good evening. You&#8217;re on the other side of the planet. I&#8217;m in Santa Monica. You&#8217;re in Abu Dhabi right now, is that correct?RAY DALIO: Yeah.PETER DIAMANDIS: Well, welcome to Moonshots, my friend. It&#8217;s a pleasure to see you. I normally run into you in Riyadh or in the Emirates, sometimes in New York. And I have to say I&#8217;ve been so looking forward to this conversation. I think the work that you have been doing recently and writing about how countries go broke, we&#8217;ll dive into that really on the back of the changing world order. As individuals, as entrepreneurs who are really focusing on AI and robotics and longevity or think about course of the future, a lot of us really want to have a stable world in which to build our dreams. And I think it&#8217;s important for folks to understand the cycles that humanity and countries go through to help them get a sense of where things are going.So no one better than you.RAY DALIO: Well, I don&#8217;t know about that, but I&#8217;ll do my best.The Five Major Forces Driving NationsPETER DIAMANDIS: All right. Well, let&#8217;s jump in. And in particular, you&#8217;ve charted what you describe as sort of the five major forces that are driving the health and wealth of nations. Could you give us an overview of those?RAY DALIO: Yeah, and I will also just touch on how I came by them. I&#8217;m a global macro investor and I&#8217;ve been for over 50 years a global macro investor and that&#8217;s taken me to all different countries and seeing how the systems work. And I&#8217;m also very much a systems mechanics person, cause effect, how does the machine work kind of person.What I learned through my experiences is that sometimes when I was really surprised, I was surprised because the things that happened to me didn&#8217;t happen in my lifetime, but they happened in history. So there were three things about five or six years ago that didn&#8217;t happen in our lifetimes. And let me go back and find the cycles of rises and declines, of reserve currencies and countries and empires and the first three. And then I discovered really the other two or realized the other two.The first was of course I knew about the debt, money economy, market cycle. Right. And we know that there&#8217;s a short term cycle. We know what that&#8217;s like. You have a recession, inflation is down, they put credit in, credit is buying power, they buy, things go up, financial markets go up, everything goes up. You get to limited capacity, inflation rises, they raise interest rates. Okay, we&#8217;ve been through 13 of those. We&#8217;re in the 13th of those cycles. But there&#8217;s also a big long term debt cycle that takes place over 80 years, give or take about 30. Debt rises relative to incomes. And then there&#8217;s a limitation to that.The second cycle very much goes with that is the political or also the internal order disorder cycle. So when you go through that cycle, there are larger wealth and values gaps that increasingly create greater and greater conflicts. The left and the right, populism of the left, populism of the right, and a fight between the two.PETER DIAMANDIS: And is that typically also an 80 year life cycle?RAY DALIO: They coincide, they don&#8217;t necessarily have to be, but they are usually together. So for example, this cycle, the last cycle began, they have wars and that&#8217;s what ends the cycle. And so World War II was also accompanied by many breakdowns of domestic orders and new orders, new systems that came into power. Sometimes they were just total revolutions, sometimes they did not break. In the case of the United States and the UK, we didn&#8217;t have a new order, new domestic order, but there was a lot of internal fighting and you came out. But in most other countries cases, they happened at the same time. There was a total breakdown of the order and new orders came about.Human Lifespan and Historical CyclesPETER DIAMANDIS: I&#8217;m going to, at some point later, I want to get into the conversation, how tied is this to human lifespan?RAY DALIO: There is, I believe, an important element that&#8217;s tied to the human lifespan because these things only happen once in a lifetime typically. So we don&#8217;t learn the lessons about war and those things. You know, it&#8217;s something like also the idea of three generations to rags-to-riches-to-rags kind of thing. But it is definitely the case, by all measures, that we say, why don&#8217;t we learn? Well, because we never experienced it before.PETER DIAMANDIS: And so I remember my parents used to, you know, they were born during the Depression, effectively, or the tail end, and it changed the way they were wired.RAY DALIO: That&#8217;s right, yeah. My dad and almost everybody at the Depression came out of that wanting to save.PETER DIAMANDIS: Turn the lights off, son. Eat that food.RAY DALIO: Right? Because the power of saving and the security. And he never could buy stocks. And if you looked at the yield, it was very interesting. The yield on stocks, the dividend and earnings yields were both about twice the yield on bonds. So from an investment point of view, they had to go down in order to provide the same total return. It made no sense. But that was their mindset, reflection of the &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to own those risky things. I want to save, work hard and so on.&#8221; And that&#8217;s part of the cycle.So that&#8217;s the second. This internal order disorder, which, as you point out is all these parts of the cycle are related. So that mentality affected how we saved and spend and so on and so forth.The International World OrderThe third part of the cycle, what I call the big cycle, is the International World Order. Who was the dominant power? So in other words, you have a war, and then you come out of the war and you say, who sets the rules? Well, the winner sets the rules. And that is the New World Order. And so the United States set the rules. That&#8217;s why the dollar is a reserve currency, that&#8217;s why the World Bank, the IMF, United Nations, they&#8217;re all in the United States, right? Because that was the New World Order. And we created an order is a type of system in which there&#8217;s collaboration.When then, when you have a rising power challenging an existing power, you know, there&#8217;s no world court that you plead your case to. And then they say, okay, you win. And we&#8217;re going to go by your rules or something. There&#8217;s no international constitution or something. Might is right. And so then you have who has the might and you have the war. So that&#8217;s the third major force tending to follow that same arc.Climate and Acts of NatureThe fourth, which isn&#8217;t the same, doesn&#8217;t have the same 80 year kind of cycle to it, big cycle to it, but it&#8217;s a big force and it&#8217;s a bigger force than the first three because it&#8217;s killed more people and it&#8217;s toppled more world and domestic orders and that is climate and acts of nature. Acts of nature, droughts, floods and pandemics have killed more people and changed. Toppled more world orders. Okay. And certainly it&#8217;s a big deal now.PETER DIAMANDIS: You know, when you speak about climate, most people go to the current climate crisis, but you&#8217;re really talking about the long cycles of climate causing drought, causing starvation, basically just ending nations.Technology and DemographicsRAY DALIO: Yes, yeah. And then there&#8217;s number five, which is man&#8217;s inventiveness in all of its various ways, particularly technology. But that inventiveness. And so it looks something like this, which I mean what I mean is technology inventiveness, you don&#8217;t lose it, you rise.PETER DIAMANDIS: And so it exists on itself. Right.RAY DALIO: Upward force. And it&#8217;s a great upward force now. And then there are these cycles like the business cycle and the political cycle. Left, right, left. You know, we had the left and now we have the right and now we have the left and so on. And these economic cycles are those. And then there&#8217;s the big cycle, which is like debt to GDP and those kinds of things.So that&#8217;s visually how it looks to me. And everything that we talk about, although there is one other force, but almost everything that we talk about is one of those five and you drop down. So whenever you&#8217;re asking me, anybody, we will go into one of those five and you could almost see where you are in the cycle. And they all relate to each other. Right. So tariffs, relates to economics, relates to geopolitics. Oh, the sixth force, which I didn&#8217;t mention, but it&#8217;s also very destined, is demographics.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah. We have a silver tsunami, we have an aging populace and we have growing. I mean, it&#8217;s interesting, right, because these are the age demographics, I think. I&#8217;m thinking they play a much bigger role today than they ever have.RAY DALIO: And will.The Impact of AI and Robotics on the EconomyPETER DIAMANDIS: And will. Yeah. Everybody, Peter here, if you&#8217;re enjoying this episode, please help me get the message of abundance out to the world. We&#8217;re truly living during the most extraordinary time ever in human history. And I want to get this mindset out to everyone. Please subscribe and follow wherever you get your podcasts and turn on notifications so we can let you know when the next episode is being dropped. All right, back to our episode.I want to get into something and then get into the five stages of the big debt cycle that you write about. And I want to dive into something instantly here which has been bothering me. I did not get a good night&#8217;s sleep thinking about this last night as we get ready, which is: are countries going to go broke faster because of AI and robotics?So if I understand this correctly, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s mandate is basically to juggle jobs and inflation, provide maximum jobs, maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long term interest rates, and traditionally you lower interest rates, that boosts employment because companies can borrow cheaply, expand operation, hire more workers. And that&#8217;s been the game up until recently.Now you&#8217;ve got Optimus humanoid robot and Figure. The prediction right now is we&#8217;ll have billions of them by the mid-2030s. Elon&#8217;s prediction when I interviewed him at FII in Riyadh, it was 10 billion by 2040. You had Sam Altman tweet out yesterday that their O3 mini model and their deep research tech will start displacing single digit employed white collar workers right away.I interviewed Marc Benioff on this podcast two weeks ago and he said, listen, with Salesforce&#8217;s new agent technology, we&#8217;re 30% more productive and are hiring no new engineers. And so the question becomes, you know, as we&#8217;re marching forward here, if a company has access to lower interest rates, wouldn&#8217;t they just buy more robots and hire more AI agents and thereby, you know, reduce labor and sort of create this massive decoupling compared to what had been the process?RAY DALIO: Yeah, it is, I think, virtually certain, but even that&#8217;s debatable. But it is virtually certain that it will replace a lot of people and that what we&#8217;ve been seeing in the form of wealth impact of technology in which there&#8217;s small population that has unicorns and it&#8217;s the most wonderful world that we can possibly imagine to be in.Also we have a population in the United States where 60% of the population has below a sixth grade reading level and is pretty broke. And so that is likely to happen. There&#8217;s going to be great disruption. And then the question, and the question for all of these things is how are we going to deal with each other?I mean the number one question on all five of these and demographics is how do you and I and we deal with each other so that we&#8217;re not just dealing with in a greedy way of our own self. Because you can have a great civil war or conflict due to not managing such social issues. And those social issues are difficult to manage because everybody has a polarity regarding those social issues.PETER DIAMANDIS: I&#8217;m going to go a step deeper here because traditionally you would hire workers that would get money in their pockets, they would start consuming, that would fuel demand, they would pay down corporate and government debts. And the challenge again is again in coming from your recent work, how governments go broke. If workers aren&#8217;t seeing wage growth and aren&#8217;t getting jobs, then who&#8217;s driving consumption and then how does that drive our economy? I guess the question is is it going to accelerate your predictions on the challenges?Technology as a Double-Edged SwordRAY DALIO: Well, the technology advances are a two-edged sword. The way I think about it is that it&#8217;s going to raise productivity, it&#8217;s going to raise output per man hour. And that&#8217;s a good thing. The power of that good thing means you don&#8217;t have to work as much, or anyway you get more out of that result. And then it becomes what do you do with the distribution of that? So it becomes how are you like with each other to deal with these incredible disruption effects.I think that we all think we&#8217;re optimizing for the things that those technologies get us. In other words, it&#8217;ll be wonderful. Our life expectancy rises, we become smarter, all of these wonderful things. Who could argue about their life expectancy rising and so on. And sometimes we lose sight that that may not even be the most important things in a world that&#8217;s in conflict.I did a study of the well-being of 24 top countries using a lot of statistics. It&#8217;s online. Anybody could see it. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Great Powers Measures&#8221; and it&#8217;s very interesting. I measure different measures of power: income, military power, education power, different types of power. And then I measure happiness and health. And past a certain basic level, there is no correlation between income and happiness and health.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, I remember that number was around $70,000 or thereabouts for happiness.RAY DALIO: It actually is considerably less than that number. I don&#8217;t know what it is but I know, like for example, Indonesia.PETER DIAMANDIS: I was thinking the United States. Yeah.RAY DALIO: Has a much happier population in terms of per capita income and in terms of health, it&#8217;s much lower, but they have a much happier population. It&#8217;s mostly above that which is needed to be out of pain, to have food. And the United States in terms of health has a five-year lesser life expectancy than Canada and comparable income countries, in other words, the developed countries. And if we think back in time, were your parents, were my parents, were they less happy or well off? And then think about wars and things. So it&#8217;s not just optimized by technology and getting more life. We have to pay attention to these other things too.The Question of a New Social ContractPETER DIAMANDIS: So part of the question becomes, is there going to be a new type of social contract that&#8217;s going to have to be created? I mean, I do believe, and I write about this and think about this a lot, that technology is a force that turns whatever was scarce into abundance. We&#8217;ve created massive energy abundance and food abundance to the point where obesity is the new issue. Abundance of information, abundance of all the entertainment you could possibly want.There&#8217;s very little that, if you pushed me, I couldn&#8217;t paint a picture of increasing abundance, even life, the amount of things you can do per unit time, per second today. So the efficiency of how we spend our time. But even with that increasing abundance, if people are unhappy and it turns us towards civil strife, then we&#8217;ve got real issues.Tailwinds vs. HeadwindsRAY DALIO: I think we can agree on the fact that technology and AI is going to be a force and it&#8217;s a tailwind. And then we also have to realize that the other four or five forces are big headwinds. And the question is, is the tailwind greater than the headwind in the appropriate time?We&#8217;re going to come into budget season over the next several months. And if they don&#8217;t do something, we&#8217;re going to have a major debt problem. But it&#8217;s a headwind. The internal conflict is a headwind. The external geopolitical conflict is a headwind. The climate thing is a headwind. The demographic thing is a headwind.When I think of the miracles that I&#8217;ve experienced, and you&#8217;ve experienced &#8211; I remember when I used to do charts that I would literally do with a ruler and colored pencils and graph paper.PETER DIAMANDIS: Sure.RAY DALIO: And I remember when the calculator came along and I remember when spreadsheets came along. When we think of digitalization and devices, they were pretty amazing over a 35-year period. They were revolutionary. And connectivity instantaneously. Wow. And then we live our lives. We&#8217;re born, we get older, we die, we live, right?PETER DIAMANDIS: Yes.RAY DALIO: And so then I think, okay, what force will this be, this AI revolution as a multiple of the force that we experienced from rulers and colored pencils and going to spreadsheets and being able to do models. That was one hell of a force. And when I look at the industrial revolution and I look at these things now, I think it&#8217;s going to be a bigger revolution..u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67 { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67:active, .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67 { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67 .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67 .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u1647ff955fe4aa5a6f3cb6c53193cb67:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; Transcript of Dr. Myles Munroe on Achieve Financial Freedom: Management Tips To Become Debt-FreeBut when we actually say, okay, what is its magnitude? I&#8217;m sort of like, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s 1.25 or 1.5 what the other one was, because when you look back on it, it may not look big when you&#8217;re in it. And then we have the headwinds and we have a timing issue. Because that baby better come on and we better get there in time.I think about what the 20s were like. The 20s was the most patents, the most innovation. And then we came to &#8217;29 and the Great Depression. I think of the bubbles that have been in quite often, they were matched also with the greatest innovations. So we cannot just simply say that these innovations will necessarily quickly and in time create such a productivity miracle that the others don&#8217;t matter.Demographics &#8211; there&#8217;s going to be a lot of people who go from working to needing and so on who aren&#8217;t going to be productive and are going to be needing. So I don&#8217;t know how that works exactly. I am impressed with it, but I don&#8217;t know exactly.Every Generation&#8217;s PerspectivePETER DIAMANDIS: I had this conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He was saying every generation feels like they&#8217;re at the most extraordinary period of technological and societal growth ever.RAY DALIO: Right.PETER DIAMANDIS: It feels that way. I mean, the stuff that is coming, Ray, I think I have to believe it&#8217;s transformational. And the question is, is it unlike what it was in the past in terms of the level degree of transformation?AI Decision MakingRAY DALIO: Let me give you what it was for me. I computerized all of my decision making. I have artificial intelligence decision making. Data comes in, criteria are specified, orders get placed, analysis is done. My decision making is efficient, all programmed literally in terms of markets. Data comes in, things get done &#8211; no people. It&#8217;s like one of those factories that has just a few people looking after it and everything happens.That came to me from the old world way of thinking, which I think most people are still in, which is &#8220;I&#8217;m a smart guy and I will make my decisions.&#8221; We are still a long way from you turning it over to the AI for decision making.PETER DIAMANDIS: There is debate, but what is a long way? Is a long way three years, five years?RAY DALIO: I find it so interesting that so many people are users of AI but they do not follow AI. If I ask it, &#8220;Okay, tariffs came in and should I do this, this and this,&#8221; I get bullshit. If I ask, &#8220;What would you do?&#8221; I get bullshit because it still comes back to understanding cause-effect relationships.PETER DIAMANDIS: And human relationships, human emotional relationships.RAY DALIO: But even the relationship between understanding the mechanics of how the tariffs affect this, this, and the other thing. You&#8217;re a long way from actually that decision making, of having the criteria and the cause-effect. That&#8217;s even more so in the markets because the markets are a zero-sum game. I have to be better than the consensus to beat the markets.All I&#8217;m saying is when we say we&#8217;re going to turn it over to AI &#8211; I do believe that the idea of it&#8217;s a partner and an associate, and boy, it could teach you and do wonderful things. But you need this as a partner.So AI &#8211; we agree, a super plus for productivity. We agree a super probably divider in who benefits and who doesn&#8217;t and that it becomes a social question as to how we deal with that. Don&#8217;t also assume that it is in an environment of law because laws are local, laws are within countries, laws do not exist between countries. And so there are competitions between countries to win at all costs. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be regulated or controlled. And we also have to look at it as a weapon because it can be a very important weapon too.The Concept of AbundancePETER DIAMANDIS: And we&#8217;ll get to that conversation about US and China, which I think is the dominant conversation in that realm right now. Before we get there, I want to talk about this concept of abundance. I wrote a book 13 years ago now called &#8220;Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think&#8221; and the argument for increasing global&#8230;RAY DALIO: I know the book. That&#8217;s a good book.PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you. The follow-on &#8220;Age of Abundance&#8221; is going to come out in &#8217;26. But looking at access to food, water, energy, healthcare, education, almost every particular factor and the demonetization and democratization has been just off the charts and accelerating. We&#8217;re on the verge of fusion potentially. The Chinese just held a fusion reaction for 18 minutes. You&#8217;ve got Helion and many others looking at fusion by turn of the decade here, solar exploding onto the scene. And energy of course drives everything else.So I guess the question is, when you think about abundance as a concept for America and Americans and for the world, I&#8217;d like to know how you think about that. Is it a world of increasing abundance? Are there factors that are going to basically shut that down?Factors That Could Disrupt AbundanceRAY DALIO: The factors that could shut it down are the factors that shut it down before and they are in the conflict. If you look at how it was shut down before the Industrial Revolution or the Great revolution of the 1920s when there were more patents than any time, all of those times it was a combination of an economic and a war and conflict.PETER DIAMANDIS: But you showed that technology is a continuous force.RAY DALIO: That&#8217;s right.PETER DIAMANDIS: Building on itself despite the up and down cycles.RAY DALIO: Yes, but the chart that we see looks like that. And life expectancy, if you look at life expectancy, it looks like that. If you look at GDP, it looks like that. If you&#8217;re listening to that upward arcing, what you don&#8217;t see, ironically, when you look at all of these things and you see the wiggles &#8211; okay, that&#8217;s World War II. And so you hardly pay any attention to it. But it mattered.These wars last maybe three years typically. And you don&#8217;t stop that unless you destroy mankind. And you won&#8217;t stop that. So when I say stop it, I&#8217;m assuming, like what happened in the 30s, a temporary slowdown.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, yeah.RAY DALIO: Because you don&#8217;t forget, you still have it. You don&#8217;t go backwards. And then you build on that, but that upward movement is slow. If you had a bust now, you could imagine how that would change allocations of money, how that would change innovations and so on. To some extent, I think that we&#8217;re in a position that might be somewhat analogous to 1998 or 1999.PETER DIAMANDIS: Dot com bust, right?The Debt Cycle and Investment WisdomRAY DALIO: Well, yeah. What happens is assets become more and more expensive, and then there&#8217;s a universal view that that is a great miraculous company and that&#8217;s a great miraculous thing. And they&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s a great miraculous company and a great miraculous thing. But the question is, how much does it cost and is it expensive? And so what happens is, actually, as an investor, you&#8217;d be much better off to buy bad companies at good prices than good companies at bad prices.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah. When my mom starts telling me, should I buy this stock? Or my Uber driver starts telling me about that, you know, you&#8217;re in trouble.RAY DALIO: And so if you look at pricing and who is the owners and so on, I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;re there. It looks more like maybe &#8217;98. But you also have a situation if you have that together with an interest rate change, and we&#8217;ll get into the interest rate discussion in a minute, I suppose you then have expensive, and you have interest rates, and then you can have what we had in 2000, you know, and pets.com and there&#8217;s a sword. And things change. And also we get so used to the idea that the disruptors don&#8217;t get disrupted. Like, that&#8217;s funny, isn&#8217;t it? I mean, everybody. They all get disrupted.PETER DIAMANDIS: Of course, it was interesting when Jeff Bezos at one of his earnings calls said, yeah, Amazon might not exist in 30 years. I mean, it shocked people for him to say that.RAY DALIO: But that&#8217;s&#8230; I mean, like, how&#8230; Wake up! Like the Dow 30, you know, go back 30 years, go back 20 years, you know, they didn&#8217;t exist. They don&#8217;t exist any longer. And the ones that are on top do exist. And that&#8217;s the nature of this evolutionary process.Economic Cycles and Entrepreneurial AdvicePETER DIAMANDIS: I&#8217;m still impressed that Microsoft is doing as well as it&#8217;s done for the last 50 years or 40 years. Yeah. Let&#8217;s get into the big debt cycle and the five stages you break it down into. And again, the lens I&#8217;m coming at this from is we have a lot of entrepreneurs who are building companies and, when time is good&#8230; We just entered a new administration where we&#8217;ve got a pro-technology, pro-M&amp;A mindset, minimized regulation. And I can vibrantly feel the energy in the biotech world, in the AI world, people are building, building, building. Capital is beginning to flow again and people are not looking at what&#8217;s likely to be coming in the next two to five years. They&#8217;re just like, the time is good now. Borrow, build, go, go, go.So what&#8217;s your advice to entrepreneurs right now? And let&#8217;s do that in the context of the five stages we&#8217;re in. And I&#8217;d like to understand where you think we are in the United States. What&#8217;s the impact of that? Elon&#8217;s having. And Doge, you know, can we hold off these debt cycles? Is there any chance for that or is it just too far gone? It&#8217;s a lot of questions, but let&#8217;s take it.RAY DALIO: No, no. And I&#8217;ll give you my thoughts on them. I want to emphasize before I do that, that study. This is the draft of my book and it&#8217;s free online so that people can read about the cause-effect relationships. Because I&#8217;m 75 years old, I&#8217;m at a stage in my life that I want to pass along things that are valuable. I&#8217;m not earning money and that&#8217;s not my goal anymore, any of that. And I want to&#8230; Everything is cause-effect relationships. There&#8217;s mechanics to it. And if I give you less than I&#8217;m able, I&#8217;m not in this conversation going to be giving you enough. And so it&#8217;s free online. Go get it and you&#8217;ll see.PETER DIAMANDIS: I know it&#8217;s on LinkedIn. Is it just Google?RAY DALIO: Yeah, you can go.PETER DIAMANDIS: Just Google how countries go broke. The principle navigating.RAY DALIO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is so amazing to me, because I&#8217;ve experienced it throughout my life, is everyone pays attention to how they feel at the moment and how they feel at the moment. And they don&#8217;t see the changes. And the changes, the cycles and everything are so important. And there are certain classic things of euphoria.So there are two classic things of euphoria. First, where we are in the economic cycle, there&#8217;s an economic cycle. There&#8217;s always been an economic cycle and there always will be an economic cycle. So we are about 65, 70% through the economic cycle that we&#8217;re in, judging by measures. I won&#8217;t digress into all of them though I can if you want. But in other words, the cycle will go on.And in the political cycle, we are in the classic first hundred day honeymoon of the new administration, which is a time of euphoria and is a time that the new beginning begins. Okay, so we&#8217;re at an unusually good moment that if you see it in the cycle in a cyclical sense and you say what is likely, okay, our aspirations are high because we have capitalism, business free markets combined with technology to produce that and the United States is on top of the world and we should be very optimistic and so on.But first of all, you&#8217;re not looking at the pricing, okay? So if you look at the pricing of assets in the United States relative to other countries right now, it&#8217;s expected that that will improve relative to the United States. So there&#8217;s a hurdle rate you always have to keep in mind, like it&#8217;s a horse race, you have to bet on that. You have to keep in mind the handicap.So, and then if you take the cycle, I bet you as we take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, do you think you&#8217;re not going to have an economic downturn? Do you think you&#8217;re not going to have a bear market? Do you think that everybody&#8217;s going to be as enthusiastic about how things are going with how the government is handling it? Do you think you&#8217;re not going to have any of those other problems really?Balancing Optimism with RealismPETER DIAMANDIS: And it&#8217;s the, I mean the challenge of an entrepreneur is you&#8217;ve got to be especially a moonshot entrepreneur. You&#8217;ve got to be super optimistic even to get into the game. But people don&#8217;t see the long term writing on the wall. So how do you properly capitalize yourself? How do you protect against the downside? How do you not over burden yourself with debt or too rapid growth? I mean, this is what I, this is the message I want folks to be listening to. Listen, I&#8217;m the guy who, not the glass isn&#8217;t half full, the glass is overflowing. I&#8217;m Mr. Optimism, Mr. Abundance. But I, as I said, reading your book, it&#8217;s got me thinking a lot. So I want to pass this on.RAY DALIO: I think first of all, one of the great things about the United States and our system is that you can fail and you could start again.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yes, it differentiates us from most of the world.RAY DALIO: That&#8217;s right. Then you think, okay, whose money is it failing? And how does that work? And am I straight and upright and honorable with people? But, you know, okay, in this world of, you know, you got to go for it. You want to go for it, and then you be straight, upright, and you go for it, and you could fail. Just don&#8217;t get permanently knocked out of the game.PETER DIAMANDIS: There&#8217;s a great talk that Bill Gross, not the economic Bill Gross. Bill Gross. My daily gives about what&#8217;s the single most important aspect for a successful company. And it&#8217;s timing. It&#8217;s living long enough to live forever. If you can live through the downturn and be there at the upturn, then&#8230;RAY DALIO: In my case, I never raised a dollar of debt or a dollar of equity. I built the largest hedge fund in the world and did very well, but I never&#8230; And now I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s the right thing, but the &#8220;don&#8217;t die&#8221; mantra was my mantra. And I always&#8230; And I did certain things like I would always say, is my profitability X relative to that? How much do I have in this way? And so on. So I constructed the finances in which it couldn&#8217;t die. It could contract, but it couldn&#8217;t die.So now I&#8217;m not sure that that&#8217;s even the smartest way. I&#8217;m saying that&#8217;s how I did it, but I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s the smartest because it&#8217;s also&#8230; Sometimes it&#8217;s okay if you die and people will understand it because of what you&#8217;re like. So invest in your character, okay? Your reputation, you can damage, you can kill your reputation. But if the company dies and you do it the right way and your options right, then that&#8217;s almost allowed in our system. But be of good character and be of good capability.Understanding the Big Debt CyclePETER DIAMANDIS: Let&#8217;s get into the big debt cycle and the five stages and give us understanding of where we are in that process, if you would.RAY DALIO: Okay, so there are these cycles that you know, the short term debt cycle or the business cycle that&#8217;s six years typically described. We know what those look like and then they rise. Debt keeps rising relative to income. Okay. And the income is needed to service the debt. Okay. So the way I view it is after the war, debts are basically written off. You&#8217;ve got, you know, you start with&#8230;PETER DIAMANDIS: Clean sheet of paper.RAY DALIO: My parents didn&#8217;t have, they didn&#8217;t have any debt, they didn&#8217;t have much. And then they begin the cycle, and it&#8217;s almost what we talked about earlier. They don&#8217;t want to spend money, you know, they don&#8217;t want to get&#8230; And in the early stage of the cycle, it&#8217;s the sound money stage. And the sound money stage can be measured by&#8230; First, does the debt create more income than it&#8217;s needed to pay it back? I mean, that&#8217;s basic.PETER DIAMANDIS: It&#8217;s a good use of capital.RAY DALIO: Right. It makes everybody happy. Yes. I lent you the money. I got paid back with my interest rates. I&#8217;m happy. You borrowed the money. You used the money in a way that allowed you to move forward. You came up with the good ideas and so on. Productivity increases and debt is not rising fast relative to income.PETER DIAMANDIS: Confidence is high. Financial systems are stable.RAY DALIO: Yep. The confidence being high starts to be a red flag.PETER DIAMANDIS: Ah, okay.RAY DALIO: You see? So what happens is you&#8217;re at that stage. And by the way, the monetary systems at that stage are hard. In other words, when we came out of World War II, this is the beginning of the new debt cycle. The new cycle, gold was there. You couldn&#8217;t lend more than gold because they had it back and so on. So you had sound money and sound finances. Okay. And then time goes on.PETER DIAMANDIS: And by the way, I&#8217;ll want to speak about Bitcoin at some point as an alternative to gold, but not right now.RAY DALIO: Great. And confidence builds. And everybody, those who are doing it are making money. The prices go from cheap to expensive. Like I told you, the earnings yield on stocks were twice the bond yield. I mean, wow, you could just take the dividends, but everybody was worried about going down. And then it changes. The prices go up, the optimism..u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc:active, .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u97c7c7945c2caee2c25e637fa6e15ffc:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; Visa's (V) CEO Charles Scharf on Q3 2014 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptAnd, you know, they say, &#8220;Peter, what? You&#8217;re not in the market. I mean, come on, what&#8217;s wrong with you, man?&#8221;PETER DIAMANDIS: You start your house and put it in the marketplace.RAY DALIO: Yeah, okay. And you go in there, and then you come really to getting invested. Asset prices become expensive. You borrow money to do it. And so you have a debt bubble. In other words, you get to the point where the income produced doesn&#8217;t service the debt. And then you begin a dynamic. Very simple.PETER DIAMANDIS: Is that where we are today?RAY DALIO: As I say, it looks to me like we&#8217;re in 1998. You know, these all become how extreme? Okay. And so I have measures, I have indicators like that give it. And it looks like 98. Okay.PETER DIAMANDIS: Which we still have a year and a half of good times ahead.RAY DALIO: I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not so precise. It&#8217;s a thing that goes like this and you know, I know that we&#8217;re over here and then what happens is that goes on and you see unsustainable debt growth. Now the unsustainable debt growth that we&#8217;re seeing right now is particularly the government. The government is going to be in financial trouble. And I&#8217;ll get into that in a minute. But what happens is you see that debt growth and then you see a rise in interest rates is the classic. And a tightening of monetary policy. Put some brakes on and that pops the bubble and then you go through the debt liquidation phase.PETER DIAMANDIS: And Ray, can I just ask a question here, which is these cycles have been over and over and over again. There are historians and printed books and so forth. Is it the politicians are just unable to make hard decisions in order to keep in political power. Is this just in human nature that we.RAY DALIO: Yes, both of those things. You&#8217;re asking why in these cycles.PETER DIAMANDIS: You.The Cycle of Debt and CreditRAY DALIO: You know, if you look at let&#8217;s say debt to income, it goes like this and why we keep going. Why does this thing exist and why don&#8217;t we sort of keep it debt to income more of the same. And there were the reasons politics and human nature, you touched on that. First of all, credit creates buying and stimulation and everybody wants up.PETER DIAMANDIS: But that&#8217;s historically because the credit employed people that then consume when you spend.RAY DALIO: I mean the government, when they say I&#8217;m now going to give you money, they&#8217;re going to give you money. And credit, it&#8217;s mostly credit and they make credit available and then you go take credit. That&#8217;s how when they lower interest rates and they make credit more available, you go, that&#8217;s. You get your car, you get your house on credit. Okay, but credit creates debt and debt serviced.Yeah, okay, so what happens is every time you get one of these, then a local dip, they want to give you credit. But it&#8217;s like giving an alcoholic a shot to get him out of the hangover, or an addict &#8211; you give them a dose. And politicians like credit because credit comes before debt payments. So I give you credit, we get in debt. You love me, you know, that&#8217;s why they want the Federal Reserve and the central government to be separate, to try to do that.But still what happens is human nature wants the credit. So that&#8217;s why debt to incomes go like that. And so, show you in this book, this is the government. And this is the cycle and that. And then this is the debt service payments that we&#8217;re going to have going forward. So, yeah, human nature. We all want up. We&#8217;re all betting on up.PETER DIAMANDIS: All the time.RAY DALIO: Unless to buy things that&#8217;ll go up.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yes. So the party ends, the bubble pops.RAY DALIO: Yeah, that&#8217;s right. You have the debt problem. And then historically, what they would do is then they would give more credit. So. Except when you hit zero interest rates, you had a problem.PETER DIAMANDIS: And I mean, I found that incredible to get into negative interest rates even.RAY DALIO: Right.PETER DIAMANDIS: Why do I think that&#8217;s incredible?RAY DALIO: No, I said right.PETER DIAMANDIS: Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.Zero and Negative Interest RatesRAY DALIO: I was with central bankers. You know, I&#8217;m in that group, sort of. And when they had zero interest rate, negative interest rates, and they were calculating, they said, how negative can we make interest rates? And they calculated, they estimated for a very short period of time it could be up to 400 basis points.And the way that they calculated that is by how much paper money that you could store in storage. Because your arbitrage, if you had the paper money, you wouldn&#8217;t have to have a negative rate. You know that. Why not hold the paper rather than to hold something that had a negative rate? And so how much negative rate could you have? And that was the essentially the arbitrage. Well, anyway, when that happened and it happened in history, by the way, it happened 1933, same thing.PETER DIAMANDIS: Wow.RAY DALIO: And what they do is then what they do is they print money and they buy the bonds. So like in 2008. Excuse me, they did that starting in 2008 and then 2020 when there was Covid, they had to send out checks. So the government had to send out checks. The government doesn&#8217;t get to print money. Where do they get the money to send out the checks?PETER DIAMANDIS: They borrow it.RAY DALIO: So they send out the checks and the central bank lends them the money and prints the money and lends them the money. So everybody gets all this money and there&#8217;s like a surprise that there&#8217;s inflation. Everybody gets all these checks and all this money, and there&#8217;s a surprise that there&#8217;s inflation. I mean, there were other things going on too, but disruption in supplies and things like that. But mostly it was the amount of money going in.So there are two things that happen at that deleveraging point. So I want to make that clear here. Here are the things that caused the deleveraging. Supply, demand and debt service. Okay, so let&#8217;s take the government. Supply, demand. The government is going to have to sell a lot of bonds to owners because there&#8217;s so much debt around. One man&#8217;s debt, another man&#8217;s assets.So because they are all the world is holding all these debt assets that actually for various reasons they don&#8217;t want to add to in a big way because it&#8217;s already such a high percentage of their portfolio. And there are geopolitical issues going on, okay. That the huge amount that will be sold will likely over be substantially greater than the demand for it.PETER DIAMANDIS: And so people start selling their debt.The Debt SpiralRAY DALIO: And when they start seeing that it&#8217;s going to be bad because they know it could be one of two things. Either you have a problem paying and interest rates go up and you have that dynamic, or the central bank comes in and buys the debt which prints the money and devalues the value of money. Okay. Either way, when there&#8217;s too much debt and a supply and demand imbalance, you don&#8217;t want to own debt, which is where I think we are. Unless there is a change. It&#8217;s what I call my 3% solution. But we won&#8217;t get into that now, I assume. But you know, there is a path here to deal with this. But if they don&#8217;t deal with it, you&#8217;re going to have a supply demand problem, I believe.And then in addition to that, what happens in debt service when debt service fills? The way I think about it is the credit system is like the circulatory system in our body. And the blood, which is the credit, brings nutrients all through the system. But what happens is that when it accumulates debt, it&#8217;s like accumulating plaque in the system because you have more and more debt service that constricts that amount that can pass through the system like the government debt service payments are.And then you hit a part of it which in markets is called, and this is usually for private creditors is called a death spiral, a debt spiral. And the debt spiral, what happens is as debt service payments rise so that you have to borrow money to pay the debt and then the creditor sees that, so they pull back and the credit spread rises. And as the credit spread rises, you have to borrow more money. That is the death spiral. And that&#8217;s when you see that dynamic. And that&#8217;s close to where we are in the government debt.PETER DIAMANDIS: But for a company that will drive a bankruptcy in the United States, that drives what?RAY DALIO: It drives the central bank to come in and buy the debt and depreciate the value of money. That&#8217;s what a monetary inflation is. A lot of people think, when I started, I think, why do you have an inflationary depression? In other words, how can you have. When demand is not working, how do you do it? You have money production.And then I say, well, why don&#8217;t they just stop producing the money? Well, because if they stop producing the money, the debt, they&#8217;ll have a deflationary debt problem. That&#8217;s the dynamic. That&#8217;s the mechanic. And I want. That&#8217;s why I want to explain these mechanics in this book, so people could see it. Because I show it in the book.PETER DIAMANDIS: And everybody thinks I&#8217;m a genius. My house prices are going. My house is going up. The value of my stock portfolio is going up, but it&#8217;s all in massively inflated dollars.RAY DALIO: I know, it&#8217;s so funny, because people think they get richer if the price of their houses and the price of things that they&#8217;re owning in a sense, go up. But it&#8217;s the same house. It&#8217;s the same stuff. Right. When it goes up in price because of inflation. I mean, buying power is what matters, not price.PETER DIAMANDIS: What can a dollar value today. Which is why I still like the meme, you know, one bitcoin equal one bitcoin. Unfortunately, one dollar does not equal one dollar. So we&#8217;re in these five stages of the debt cycle. And just to wrap this up, we&#8217;re in the deleveraging stage. And.RAY DALIO: Well, the government. You mean now?PETER DIAMANDIS: Well, no, I&#8217;m saying in your five stages.RAY DALIO: And then that deleveraging stage, typically if the debt is denominated in the currency that the central bank can print, you always get the printing.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yes.RAY DALIO: And you always get the devaluation of money. And then what happens is then the debt becomes so cheap that it&#8217;s easy to pay it off. So if you&#8217;re watching, like Japan is a good example, if you owned a Japanese bond, you would have lost about 80% of your money relative to something stable, like, let&#8217;s say, gold.And you would have lost about 60% of your money relative to a US bond because you got 3% less interest rates and the currency depreciated by almost 4% a year. And that 7% a year is what you would lose. And then what happens is, if you&#8217;re in Argentina, take it to the extreme, you take that debt and you pay it off because it&#8217;s worthless with barrels.PETER DIAMANDIS: Of pesos or whatever it might be.RAY DALIO: Yeah.Government Efficiency and the FuturePETER DIAMANDIS: Where are we in terms? I mean, let me ask the question I started with, which is, we&#8217;re in this administration. Elon jumped in the department of Government efficiency is created. The goal is cut back government waste, try and get us more towards a balanced budget. I mean, clearly, had we not done anything, there is no hope, we&#8217;re heading towards disaster. Is there any. Do you think that Doge can make an impact on this?RAY DALIO: I honestly, I honestly don&#8217;t know the consequences, the realities of that. I can&#8217;t answer your question. It&#8217;s too complicated for me. I&#8217;m not at the nitty gritty of being able to say, if you shut this thing off, what are the repercussions of that and how that works.I would need to have a much more, I need to have not only a much more detailed, but I would also need to be able to anticipate, you know, there&#8217;s an action or reaction and what the reaction is. It&#8217;s something like the tariffs, you know. But you are very difficult for me to answer your question.PETER DIAMANDIS: Okay, I appreciate it. But you are clear, if we doing nothing, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a definitive wall we&#8217;re racing towards.Ray Dalio&#8217;s 3% SolutionRAY DALIO: Yes, this goes back to my 3% solution. It&#8217;s covered in there under the existing budget. If there&#8217;s not a rolling forward, if there is a rolling forward of the Trump tax cuts from before, the size of the deficit will be about 7.5% of GDP. You&#8217;re going to need about 3% of GDP to stabilize it. So I call this my 3%, 3-part solution.First, get 3% in your mind, okay, can we get the deficit down to 3% of GDP? And there are three things that can do that. The first two is spending taxes. And by the way, when I mean taxes, I mean tax revenue, which isn&#8217;t the same as tax rates, spending taxes and interest rates, because the interest rate on the debt is such a big factor.I&#8217;ve gone through the calculations and have studied this and in that study you can read it. If, one way or another, I don&#8217;t care how you do it, how you do it is almost an ideological question. The fact that you need to do it is important. So it&#8217;s like the patient that has too much plaque and they&#8217;re eating and they&#8217;re not exercising. I don&#8217;t care whether you eat greens or you exercise, but you got to get that plaque, you&#8217;ve got to get that going the other way.And so that&#8217;s the 3%. You could do it from some mix. Now in my studying these, if you do it with the right mix, so that it&#8217;s not too much of anything, it&#8217;s not traumatic. And if you do that, you will get a fall in rates naturally. Because the market will be better off. Less risk. And if there was any weakness due to the fiscal restraint, the central bank will ease monetary policy.That&#8217;s always been the case. I show, I don&#8217;t know how many cases, like 20 cases there around the world. This happened from 1991 to 1998 in the United States. So there&#8217;s a way, the real issue, I don&#8217;t really care that I think all the policymakers should make this 3% pledge because whoever it is, they&#8217;re going to argue over the way.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah.RAY DALIO: And they won&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s my worry.The Impact of Longevity on EconomicsPETER DIAMANDIS: There&#8217;s a few high flying solutions out there and I want to throw one towards you, Ray. You know my passion about longevity and extended healthspan. Dario, who&#8217;s the CEO of Anthropic, I don&#8217;t know if you know Dario.RAY DALIO: No.PETER DIAMANDIS: Was at Davos and saying something that&#8217;s been discussed by a number of other individuals that in the next five to ten years we will see fundamental breakthroughs in human healthspan and longevity. That we may see his words, not mine, a doubling of the human lifespan.You know, we have $101 million Healthspan Xprize going on right now to add 20 healthy years. And so one of the factors I find fascinating is the notion of if people are vibrant, have the cognition and the fortitude, the vitality to keep functioning so that at 80 or 90 you&#8217;ve got the wherewithal you had in your 50s or 60s. I have to imagine that would have a fundamental impact on the economics here.RAY DALIO: Here&#8217;s my confusion. I don&#8217;t have the answer. A number of those studies I&#8217;ve seen said that extending lifespan is going to raise the cost.PETER DIAMANDIS: The cost of health care.RAY DALIO: Okay. You would know this better than I. But, and then there becomes the retirement age question, which is very much a political question. So the question is, are you productive or are you a consumer of productivity?I would say that if you&#8217;re watching around the world extending working years, you don&#8217;t see it. I mean, you see the fight against it almost political. It&#8217;s a political non-starter source of fight. So you have to ask yourself, does the working years get extended, let&#8217;s say.And then what I had read was you have more years that you have to take care of that person and so on. So it&#8217;s not like you go to become young again. Now, I&#8217;m not arguing that that&#8217;s the case. I&#8217;m saying I don&#8217;t know the answer.PETER DIAMANDIS: Today in the US the average lifespan is around 79. The average healthspan is around 63. Meaning you&#8217;re spending the last 16, 17 years of your life in some level of pain and decrepitude. And I think the goal is, can we actually change that so that you&#8217;re healthy initially and then extend the.RAY DALIO: You&#8217;ve got it engineered beautifully. But I suspect, longevity, because you were just talking about longevity, not health in those years. You know, I mean, like the one thing we got this baby boom and these people, these old people of my generation and you got a lot of them living and then when they die, they&#8217;re not a burden. Okay, so dying from actuarial tables or financial tables can be good.PETER DIAMANDIS: Remember Logan&#8217;s Run, the movie?RAY DALIO: Oh, yeah.PETER DIAMANDIS: You were supposed to be, you know, knock yourself off at age 35 and turn yourself into a food supply. Anyway, that&#8217;s a different story.I believe that if this person is got the energy and the drive and is not in pain and is not restricted by regulation, that at the peak of your capability, you&#8217;re going to want to keep in the game. And that&#8217;s the hope. That&#8217;s at least the work.RAY DALIO: Well, I would say if you actually look at what happens in countries, your hope is not consistent with the realities. In other words, when people come to their working, their retirement age, they will fight for that retirement age..u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#e6e6e6; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #464646!important; text-decoration:none; } .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df:active, .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:#E67E22; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df .postTitle { color:#464646; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u58c6bbb6e127b7c05ff0946a36ab49df:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; }ALSO READ:&nbsp; Bank of America's (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan on Q3 2014 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptPETER DIAMANDIS: We&#8217;re going to find out soon enough.

Keep me alive, keep me alive. I&#8217;m trying to, you know, even if I get decrepit in my years that I wouldn&#8217;t have been alive.PETER DIAMANDIS: Tony Robbins, who&#8217;s a mutual dear friend, and I both invite you to come and join us at Fountain Life and let us.RAY DALIO: Well, you know, I will. Thank you.Bitcoin vs. GoldPETER DIAMANDIS: I appreciate that. Let&#8217;s talk about bitcoin a second. I know you&#8217;re a bitcoin holder, but you&#8217;re still more excited about gold, if I remember correctly. How do you think about bitcoin? You know, Mike Saylor was my roommate, fraternity brother at MIT and he&#8217;s probably one of the most outspoken individuals. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard Michael speak about bitcoin. Are you sold by his vision?RAY DALIO: Let me tell you what I think about it because I&#8217;ll speak for myself and I think these things are accurate. First thing is we agree on anti-money, we agree on anti-debt. Okay, that&#8217;s important.PETER DIAMANDIS: When you say anti-money, define anti-money please.RAY DALIO: That there are two purposes of money and that is as a storehold of wealth and medium of exchange. Being on exchange, it&#8217;ll exist. Store hold wealth, you store it in a bond. Money and debt are the same thing because when you&#8217;re holding money, you&#8217;re holding it in a debt instrument. Anything you&#8217;re going to put your money, your dollars, you&#8217;re going to be in debt instrument. Otherwise, you know, you lose 5% a year or something.And so money and debt are the same because debt is a promise to get the money. So they&#8217;re the same. We have a supply demand problem with this money and debt, okay? So I don&#8217;t want to own money and debt. And so we&#8217;re aligned. Anybody who&#8217;s going to want to say it as a store holder of wealth is because the quantity of it cannot be increased other than through the mining activity, you know, but without that restrictions.And that&#8217;s that. So the first thing I want to emphasize is are you there? Is that part of you there? And then how much should be in your portfolio of that thing or those things. So I may kind of those things guy that prefers gold for the reasons I&#8217;m going to explain. But I have some bitcoin, but I&#8217;ve got much more gold.And the amount that I think is a prudent amount. If you look at correlations and the systems and all sorts of things, the least risk amount to have in terms of maintaining your buying power is somewhere between 10 and 15% of a portfolio.PETER DIAMANDIS: So I think they should be bitcoin or gold.RAY DALIO: Anti-money.PETER DIAMANDIS: Anti-money. And you&#8217;re putting the two together in that bucket.RAY DALIO: Okay, yeah. Now on the bitcoin versus gold, here&#8217;s the thing. Bitcoin is not a private asset. The governments watch it. They know what you&#8217;re going to have, they know where you are, they can tax it, they can take money away from exists at their pleasure and they can do anything they want with you. Their comfort of you being in bitcoin is better than their comfort view being in gold, let&#8217;s say.PETER DIAMANDIS: Well, I agree the fact that it can be monitored, the movement of it can be monitored. But it doesn&#8217;t exist at their pleasure. Are you saying that the government could shut down?RAY DALIO: They could if they wanted to, under regulation and so on, tax you? Yes, as a matter of fact, like I was saying, I was with the central bankers who said the reason that we when negative interest rates. How much could it if they had a digital currency? There was no floor on the negative interest rates because they could tax you.PETER DIAMANDIS: Okay.RAY DALIO: So, you don&#8217;t have the privacy. You can get taxed and so on. Whereas the saying of gold is it&#8217;s the only asset that you can have that&#8217;s not somebody else&#8217;s liability, meaning you have it in your possession. And that&#8217;s somewhat different.The second thing is central banks holding it as reserves, watching the periods of conflict and so on. They go to gold, even in terms of their enemies. Because like what governments do in periods of conflict or whatever is they print money. They make bonds. And that&#8217;s not good. And they don&#8217;t want to hold each other&#8217;s bonds. Nobody wants to hold the bonds. And that&#8217;s why they hold gold. They don&#8217;t trust each other. And that wouldn&#8217;t work that way for Bitcoin because governments can control it.PETER DIAMANDIS: We do inflate gold every year. What percentage is mined every year?RAY DALIO: A pittance.PETER DIAMANDIS: Okay.RAY DALIO: I don&#8217;t know, like 1% or so of the stock of gold.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yes.RAY DALIO: And consumption for jewelry. And that&#8217;s it. Anyway, it has been for thousands of years in all different places.And another thing is I can understand price changes in gold. In other words, if prices change, if this changes and that changes, I can make sense why the gold price changed that way. I have a problem doing that with Bitcoin. It still very much moves in a way that it wouldn&#8217;t be necessary. It&#8217;s a supply, demand, speculative market that&#8217;s tougher for me to nail down.PETER DIAMANDIS: I am curious by the way. I just asked Anthropic here and it&#8217;s. We inflate gold about 1.5 to 2% per year.RAY DALIO: Yeah, that makes sense.PETER DIAMANDIS: I would expect bitcoin to go up when there is international strife or instability or difficulty predicting what&#8217;s coming next. But we&#8217;re seeing swings that are not related to anything that&#8217;s really explainable today.RAY DALIO: That&#8217;s right. So when I go down that list of things I say I favor gold for those reasons.PETER DIAMANDIS: Could you imagine changing your mind if some.RAY DALIO: Sure. If something came along that tell me why. I also. Some people have said and I&#8217;m not sure if this is right. It&#8217;s been quite amazing, but that with quantum computing and so on, there&#8217;s a good chance that you can break it.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true.RAY DALIO: I&#8217;m not an expert. I&#8217;m just throwing another thing in there.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, I&#8217;ll give you another answer to that, Ray, just so you have it in your quiver. If quantum computing were to allow us to break encryption on Bitcoin, we have a lot bigger problems. That same quantum decryption would give us the nuclear codes, would allow anybody to enter your bank accounts, allow us to do a lot more.Finding Balance in a Complex WorldRAY DALIO: You know, we need to go to some island paradise. It was so funny. I was in Bali in this paradise. And then I fly up to China. In Bali, there was this spot off the grid and they have this food plot. I didn&#8217;t even know how much land produces how much food. I didn&#8217;t realize that you can have a plot of land that&#8217;s not very big and you could live wonderfully. And everybody&#8217;s in peace and they&#8217;re going to their meditation and they&#8217;re doing this and they&#8217;re enjoying life.And then I get up and fly to Beijing, and I&#8217;m with leaders in Beijing, and they&#8217;re fighting for control of the world.PETER DIAMANDIS: You&#8217;re in the first place.RAY DALIO: Okay, yeah, off the grid. And they&#8217;re going to get me and they&#8217;ll take my phone. I mean, we do have to reflect on some of these things.China, Technology, and Global CompetitionPETER DIAMANDIS: Let&#8217;s cover two final subjects if you&#8217;ve got the time. I know it&#8217;s getting late there, but I want to talk about China and I want to talk about what your 2025 predictions might look like.There&#8217;s a lot of conversation right now about China versus us. We&#8217;ve got a new administration coming in. My concern, of course, is we&#8217;ve seen recently with Deep Sea, we&#8217;ve seen with nuclear fusion &#8211; while the US is vibrant in terms of an entrepreneurial and technology ecosystem and engine, China should never be misjudged as someone who is pushing across the board. How do you think about China? How should an entrepreneur think about China?RAY DALIO: We are at war with China, and it hasn&#8217;t turned to a military war, but it&#8217;s actually turned to very much a subversive war in which each would overthrow the government and do all sorts of stuff. And it&#8217;s not going to go back, it&#8217;s going to be that way.The two countries fight wars differently. A leader in China, one of the top leaders in China, was describing the Chinese way of fighting war and the Western way, which he calls the Mediterranean way of fighting war. The Mediterranean way is that you go in and you fight and you fight to win and you kill each other. The Chinese way of fighting is so that your opponent doesn&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re fighting. If you&#8217;re not smart enough to win the war without actually fighting, you stop being very smart. So it&#8217;s a war of deception.And then there&#8217;s this desire to have these separate parallel universes in technology. I don&#8217;t believe that you&#8217;re going to be able to maintain control of intellectual property that is something that is publicly used. Maybe if you go inside your spot and you have sandboxing and you never bring it out and you never look at it, then maybe you can intellectually protect it &#8211; that&#8217;s sort of how the atomic bomb was built.By the way, both countries are trying to secretively build weapons that the other one can&#8217;t fight against. Because the way you rarely win is you build the weapon that the other one can&#8217;t fight against secretively, you show it to them, they find out that they can&#8217;t win and then you win without fighting. That&#8217;s the best way.We&#8217;ve changed the world order. It&#8217;s been very clear by Donald Trump that we have gone from a multinational multilateral environment to a unilateral, each country for their own might as right kind of environment. And so we are in that unilateral might is right. If I can exert pressure on you to get what I want, that&#8217;s the way it is, which is historically what most of history has been like.We&#8217;ve had a few wars. We had the Ukraine-Russia war, which I think will come to some kind of a ceasefire, which will be temporary. You&#8217;ve had the Israeli-Iran and proxies war that Israel won. And you&#8217;ve had a conflict between the United States and China, where the United States did much better and China did much worse than they would have expected.The Chinese have domestic issues. We have domestic issues. And I think nobody wants to go to worse war. So I think that probably over the near term you&#8217;re going to have this behind the scenes, subversive kind of war.But in terms of economics and technologies, the winner of the technology cannot lose the war. And by the way, that&#8217;s also something that&#8217;s economically important. I think in terms of the super scalers &#8211; you must win the technology war. Not only countries must win the technology war, those companies must win. And profit may not be the number one thing.I think the opportunities are in the applications and the usage of it. China is doing a lot better in terms of actual applications. We&#8217;re advanced on chips, but in terms of actual usage and embedding in Chinese society, they have advantages. So we have this dynamic going on and China has its own set of issues. I think that probably over the near term you&#8217;ll have a lot of pushing the edge, but probably not going over the edge. But that&#8217;s not a permanent set of circumstances.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, you said a few things I think are really important to hit on here. Number one, any kind of restrictions we put on China for AI like chips from Nvidia and so forth, all that does is force them to basically start building capabilities internally. And with Huawei chips right now, the second thing it forces them to do is to become a lot more efficient.So Deep Sea was an example of, okay, we don&#8217;t have the chip resources, so how do we change the algorithms and just do it a lot more efficiently? Intelligence brings a new sort of Darwinian evolution of a constraint. Evolution will find a way around it.I&#8217;m a bit concerned &#8211; I&#8217;m curious what your thoughts are. You mentioned that 60% of the US doesn&#8217;t read above the sixth grade level, which is kind of shocking. We do have a leveling of the education playing field happening very soon, when this device becomes a polymath in your pocket, right? Where in a conversation with your AI agent, you&#8217;re able to deduce or learn or create or serve anything that you need, both in China and the U.S. I mean, so we&#8217;ve got an augmented population. You don&#8217;t think so?Education and TechnologyRAY DALIO: Well, I just go back to my experience. I happen to have a son whose passion is ed tech. And he&#8217;s gone into the third world and gone to the poorest areas to make this connected, to make computers and all of that. And the original theory and expectation was, why shouldn&#8217;t they not only get educated by this &#8211; he made a device so that it connects to TVs and makes computers and all of that. And why shouldn&#8217;t they do that? And then if they do, not only do you educate those, but you have them have different kinds of jobs that they can do remotely and so on.And so when I look at the wealth gaps or these gaps, I was surprised that that didn&#8217;t happen. So I&#8217;m hesitant to leap to the notion that technology alone solves these problems. A lot has to do with parenting. A lot has to do with who&#8217;s giving the guidance, what is it like.We have an issue with parenting. We have an issue &#8211; okay, why does 60% of the population have less than a sixth grade education? There&#8217;s almost a leap that those people are going to take this technology and they&#8217;re going to be productive and so on. Well, I was surprised that it didn&#8217;t happen and I can kind of see maybe why it might not happen. At least I&#8217;m not assuming it necessarily will.2025 PredictionsPETER DIAMANDIS: Fair enough. 2025 year ahead. What are you seeing? What are your predictions for what&#8217;s the best we&#8217;re going to see in this year?RAY DALIO: Obviously, 2025 is a year of great, great uncertainty. I think that the first big issue that we&#8217;re going to deal with is the budget issue. Right now, it&#8217;s not the issue. And everybody thinks of it not as the issue in the first half of the year. It&#8217;s going to be the issue. And how they deal with that is very important to me in terms of the supply demand.Because let&#8217;s remember that the treasury market is the basis of all markets. It&#8217;s the foundation of all markets. And if you create a reverberation for supply demand, then it changes all that capital raising and funding. I mean, the world gets disrupted. So that&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;m watching.Then we&#8217;re going to see the first hundred days of a new administration, which is a time of great optimism and also a time when priorities have got to be set. It&#8217;s real world time now. It&#8217;s game time. So the theories are going to be put to the test. Does the cost cutting happen? Is that realistic? How many numbers can you do that? And then there has to be prioritization.I think the prioritization is also going to be smartly on energy for data centers and the building of AI to win. Because whoever wins the tech war is going to win the military war with China. But how that game goes, it&#8217;s going to be a tough game.So when I look at that, I think we&#8217;re not going to be as happy a year from now as we think we&#8217;re going to be. Because things are pretty expensive if you have interest rates rising. There are these issues we face with AI, and it&#8217;s got to be done within two years. And it&#8217;s got to stick because midterm elections are going to be harder for the Republicans because they have more seats up. So it&#8217;s going to be interesting.Advice for EntrepreneursPETER DIAMANDIS: You&#8217;re an entrepreneur or I&#8217;m an entrepreneur. What&#8217;s your advice, looking forward, thinking about planning your business for the next year or two years? What&#8217;s your wisdom?RAY DALIO: You&#8217;re at a time of relatively good capital markets. Credit spreads are narrow. There&#8217;s a lot of money. Plan on surviving droughts as well as the difficult times.PETER DIAMANDIS: Fill your equity coffers.RAY DALIO: Yeah.PETER DIAMANDIS: Don&#8217;t take on too much debt. Plan for realistic growth.RAY DALIO: And make great partners with the investors that are in it. Ultimately it&#8217;s going to be not only your numbers, but it&#8217;s going to be your character. Don&#8217;t be overly greedy, but have the relationships as well as the money that is your foundation.PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah. I think that&#8217;s beautiful wisdom, Ray. Grateful for you. Thank you for making your research available and writing these books.I sure wish we humans were a bit more intelligent or had longer memories. I do wonder sometimes whether AI can help us get out of these repeated cycles and support us in more logical planning and growth. I guess we&#8217;re going to find out.RAY DALIO: Maybe if we ask it the right questions.PETER DIAMANDIS: Good to see you, my friend. Thank you again for your time. Grateful for you.RAY DALIO: It&#8217;s always a pleasure. Thank you, Peter.PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you, buddy.Related PostsIs Your Business Organized Poorly?

										Published 12 months ago on July 5, 2024

Ray Dalio is highly successful investor, hedge fund manager, author, and billionaire.  He founded the American investment firm Bridgewater Associates and authored multiple New York Times bestselling books like, &#8216;Principles: Life and Work&#8217;, and &#8216;Principles For Dealing With a Changing World&#8217;. 
Having started from his firm out of his two-bedroom apartment back in 1975, to then losing everything just 7 years later and being so broke he had to borrow $4,000 loan from his father to rebuild; Ray Dalio bounced back from rock-bottom to become a multibillionaire who&#8217;s firm now manages over $123.5 billion in assets. As such, we’re publishing some of the best Ray Dalio quotes to help you peer into a mind that knows how to overcome failure and setbacks, and thrive in a changing world.
So, if you’re ready for some true words of wisdom, then let’s dive into these powerful Ray Dalio quotes:

10.  &#8220;By and large, life will give you what you deserve.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
11.  &#8220;The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful.  Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio

Many people don&#8217;t know this, but success isn&#8217;t just about striking it big with some great new invention or idea. Success is also more than becoming famous and having a T.V. series created about you. Indeed, for most people, success is not lottery winning type of event. Rather, success is more about making up our minds to do something, and then proceeding to accomplish that thing in a reasonable amount time. So, considering success is more about patience, persistence, and getting up everyday to put in the work, we&#8217;ve gathered a handful of inspiring quotes on patience and success.
&#8220;Patience is a Key Element of Success.&#8221;
Our hope is that these quotes will inspire you to take a step back when things don&#8217;t seem to be going your way, assess the situation, and then truly realize that what you are after is possible, and that it may just require a bit more effort and patience on your part.  So, if you&#8217;re ready for some great quotes on patience and success, let&#8217;s dive in.

		All Ray Dalio Books, Sorted Chronologically (and by Popularity)
Ray Dalio is an investor and philanthropist, born in 1949 in New York City. With a net worth of around $20 billion, Dalio is one of the top 100 richest people in the world. The founder and longtime CEO of Bridgewater, the world&#8217;s largest hedge fund, Dalio has pioneered many financial innovations and techniques, many of which have become industry standard in the 40 years since the company&#8217;s founding. In his later years, he started publishing his writing, and if you&#8217;re looking for a full list of Ray Dalio books, you&#8217;ve come to the right place!
From his early days as a golf caddie for Wall Street professionals, Dalio has come a long way. He started investing at the age of 12, when he bought some shares of Northeast Airlines and, by pure luck, tripled his money. He&#8217;s been hooked ever since. Growing his company, however, wasn&#8217;t always easy. In the 80s, Dalio sized up the economy wrong and paid for it dearly. He had to let go all of his employees and borrow money from his parents for rent.
Eventually, however, the Harvard MBA managed to turn things around and grew Bridgewater into the world&#8217;s largest hedge fund with over $100 billion in assets under management. As part of his &#8220;second half of life&#8221; giving back phase, Dalio has become a philanthropist, giving away billions of dollars and signing Warren Buffett&#8217;s giving pledge, vowing to donate most of his money&nbsp; to charitable causes after he dies.
He also began sharing his many lessons about life, business, and investing, first in Tony Robbins&#8217; book Money, in which he outlined his &#8220;All Seasons&#8221; portfolio allocation strategy, then through his project and eponymous book called Principles, which shares a philosophy for success and happiness in life and work.
Since Dalio has also published several fascinating reads about the economy, politics, and how the world at large works, we thought we&#8217;d collect and list all Ray Dalio books for you. We&#8217;ve summarized&nbsp;over 1,000 summaries to date, and Ray&#8217;s book Principles is one of our (and our readers&#8217;) all-time favorites.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
This list is sorted both by order of publication and popularity.&nbsp;You can easily navigate it by clicking on whichever section interests you the most in the table of contents below. For each of Ray Dalio&#8217;s books, we&#8217;ve included an image of the cover, a 1-sentence-summary, and our favorite quote. We&#8217;ve also listed our most interesting takeaways and why you might want to read the book yourself, as well as what order to read them in if you&#8217;re trying to read them all!

All Ray Dalio Books (in Chronological Order)
1. Economic Principles&nbsp;(2015)
Favorite Quote
“The economy works like a simple machine, but many people don&#8217;t understand it, or they don&#8217;t agree on how it works, and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering.” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Economic Principles is a three-part compendium on how the global economy works, what role debt plays in this free market system, and how policy makers can use the tools at their disposal to ensure the people of their nations enjoy productivity growth and prosperity.
Why should you read it?
As you can tell from the &#8220;cover&#8221; of this book, this is not a title that was ever officially published. It was an early, free, PDF draft version of what would later become three distinct works: How the Economic Machine Works, Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, and Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. That said, this humble attempt by Ray to share his wisdom on the economy is still a whopping 300 pages long, and while the original PDF is no longer available on Ray Dalio&#8217;s official Economic Principles site, you can still find it online.
However, since parts two and three are already available as standalone works, the main reason you might want to read this one is probably How the Economic Machine Works, and that is basically just the transcript of a wonderful, animated, 30-minute Youtube video Ray already released in 2012. Both the video and text explain how, by combining graphic representations of the short-term debt cycle, long-term debt cycle, and productivity growth, we can see where the world economy is headed. If you want to understand markets, study macroeconomics, or be a better investor, this video and book might be for you.
Key Takeaways
The economy is the sum of all transactions made in society.
One person&#8217;s spending is another person&#8217;s income, and therefore, spending drives the economy.
If debt rises faster than income, and income rises faster than productivity, that&#8217;s when things go wrong.

2. Principles&nbsp;(2017)
Favorite Quote
“My painful mistakes shifted me from having a perspective of ‘I know I’m right’ to having one of ‘How do I know I’m right?’” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Principles outlines and breaks down the set of rules for work and life billionaire investor Ray Dalio, CEO of the world&#8217;s largest hedge fund, has acquired throughout his 40-year career in finance.
Why should you read it?
This book might be one of the best examples that, when you read a book, you can acquire the wisdom of an entire human lifetime in just a few hours. In three parts, Dalio tells his personal story, the principles for living a good life he&#8217;s learned as part of living that story, and the lessons he&#8217;s won through much pain and reflection about how people can work together to achieve great success. If you want to build more systems in your life and understand the well-oiled machines powering big companies, read this book.
Key Takeaways
Principles are powerful weapons in the fight against flawed thinking.
Radical truth and transparency are two of Ray’s most important ideas.
Great businesses use principles to create environments where the best ideas win.

3. Principles for Navigatig Big Debt Crises (2018)
Favorite Quote
“Buying something you can’t afford means spending more than you make. You’re not just borrowing from your lender; you are borrowing from your future self.” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises is a complete, macroeconomic education in three parts, explaining the archetype of the big debt cycle, giving detailed case studies of historic inflation and debt crises, and sharing 48 more examples from history for anyone wanting to learn how to navigate times of economic turmoil.
Why should you read it?
With unlimited money printing and skyrocketing debt running rampant for almost all nations across the globe, Ray pulled back the curtain on the research and analysis process at Bridgewater. This 450+ page tome explains how debt has both made and broken nations and governments in the past, and if you want to learn how scenarios much similar to the ones we&#8217;re in today have, can, and will play out, this is a must read. Dalio covers the archetypal big debt cycle in just 50 pages, with the remainder of the book dedicated to detailed case studies of the German debt and hyperinflation crisis in the 1920s, the US debt crisis leading up to World War II, and the financial crisis of 2008.
Ray originally gave away the book for free through his email list, and you can still find it on the principles website. Alternatively, you can buy a nice hardcover or Kindle version on Amazon which, for a big book like this, is always a good idea, I find.
Key Takeaways
Crisis and debt cycles are inevitable due to human nature.
A big part of economic depressions is people discovering that what they thought was wealth was actually never really there.
Debt isn’t necessarily bad, and in the long run, debt crises usually fade in the face of rising productivity.

4. Principles for Success (2019)
Favorite Quote
“Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others and boxes you in, you need to decide for yourself what to do and you need to have the courage to do it.” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Principles for Success is an illustrated, shortened version of Dalio&#8217;s key life lessons that resulted in the unconven­tional principles which helped him become one of the world’s most suc­cessful people, including the 5-step evolutionary loop built around setting goals, learning from your mistakes, and collaborating with others to produce exceptional results.
Why should you read it?
This is the perfect, short, easy entry into Ray&#8217;s world of principles. Designed like a children&#8217;s book, it allows you to follow Dalio&#8217;s journey step by step and learn the same lessons he learned along the way. The illustrations are fun, and the takeaways powerful yet simple. I would recommend this to almost anyone, including teenagers. Dalio has also turned this into another animated, 30-minute Youtube video series, and it&#8217;s fantastic in that format as well.
Key Takeaways
Pain + reflection = progress.
Use the 5-step evolutionary loop to keep striving for better.
Think for yourself while being radically open-minded.

5. Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order (2021)
Favorite Quote
“No system of government, no economic system, no currency, and no empire lasts forever, yet almost everyone is surprised and ruined when they fail.” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order explains how, historically, empires have risen and fallen through a combination of financial, educational, economic, and geopolitical factors, and how nation states can allocate their resources in order to move through this big cycle gracefully and without hurting one another.
Why should you read it?
Another three-part mega guide to global affairs, this book brings all of Dalio&#8217;s previous analysis on the economy, productivity, and debt cycles together. The first part explains &#8220;how the world works&#8221; and how nations become successful through a combination of money, credit, debt, and economic activity while ensuring inner societal order. In part two, Ray provides three case studies, outlining how the Dutch, British, and US empires, including their currencies, became world powers — and then lost that status. The third part takes a look at the future, particularly with regards to the latest rising power, China, and its relations to the US.
If you want to know what is going on in global markets, why we have certain geopolitical tensions right now, and where the world is headed, read this fantastic book. Oh, and as you might have guessed already at this point, Ray made an animated video about this too. It&#8217;s 43 minutes long but absolutely worth the watch.
Key Takeaways
Global superpowers start with a focus on improving education which, following a long series of steps, will lead to that nation&#8217;s currency increasing in value.
The life cycle of an empire usually lasts 80 years and consists of three phases: the rise, the top, and the decline.
Right now, the US is declining, while China is on the rise — but the future is not decided yet.

6. Principles: Your Guided Journal (2022)
Favorite Quote
“If you recognize that the way to be great is to focus on improving, giving and receiving criticism should be motivating and welcomed.” — Ray Dalio
The Book in One Sentence
Principles: Your Guided Journal is a customized learning journey aimed at helping you discover your own, unique life principles while overcoming, learning from, and getting the most out of your mistakes.
Why should you read it?
Full of easy, quick self-assessments and fun, digitally extendable exercises, this book is an interactive experience. Ray will take you by the hand, walk you through his process, and provide the space for you to apply it to your own life situation. If you want a quick, actionable way of both mastering and implementing Dalio&#8217;s principles, this book is for you.
Key Takeaways
Getting what you want out of life depends on mastering the 5-step evolutionary loop.
Your two biggest barriers in life are your ego and your blind spots.
Some changes you can&#8217;t anticipate — but you can always design your behavior around them after they happen.

Ray Dalio Books by Popularity
Want to know which Ray Dalio books are the most popular? Here&#8217;s a short reorder of the list based on the total number of Amazon ratings, ranked from most to least.
Principles: Life and Work (⭐️ 12,200+ Ratings ⭐️)
Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail (⭐️ 5,200+ Ratings ⭐️)
Principles for Success (⭐️ 1,300+ Ratings ⭐️)
Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises (⭐️ 1,000+ Ratings ⭐️)
Economic Principles (⭐️ 200+ Ratings ⭐️)
Principles: Your Guided Journal (Create Your Own Principles to Get the Work and Life You Want) (⭐️ 20+ Ratings ⭐️)
I can&#8217;t think of anyone who more qualifies as a role model for success yet presents their learnings so humbly and calmly. If you watch some interviews with him, you can clearly tell Ray is an introvert who&#8217;s just sharing his message because he thinks it&#8217;s important. He&#8217;s a good guy with the heart in the right place, and the fact that he&#8217;s sold more than five million books shows that people really support him and want him (and thus themselves) to win.
In What Order Should You Read Ray Dalio&#8217;s Books?
Which of &#8216;s books should you read first? If you ask us, here&#8217;s the order in which reading his books makes the most logical sense based on their topics:
Principles for Success: Since Ray wrote this book for his grandchildren, it is by far the easiest to understand and start with. If you enjoy this, it&#8217;s a great sign you should dive deeper.
Principles: This is Ray&#8217;s seminal book, and while it&#8217;s long, it comes with a lot of pointers and help to make it skimmable. So even if you don&#8217;t read it in full the first time around, this will dramatically improve your decision-making and work relationships.
Principles: Your Guided Journal: After understanding what principles are and which ones Ray has discovered, it&#8217;s time to find your own! What better way to do that than through some daily writing as part of this tour de force of self-awareness, full of useful exercises and insightful quotes.
Economic Principles: If you&#8217;re interested in Ray&#8217;s insights on money, finance, and the economy on top of what life advice he can offer, this is a good primer to start with to understand the basics of how markets, transactions, productivity, and their global interrelations work.
Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises: Once you know how the economy works in principle, it&#8217;s time to get a grasp on what happens when it breaks. With its detailed case studies of historic inflation crises and recessions, this book is the perfect way to do just that.
Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Finally, it&#8217;s time to put everything together and get a full picture of what happens as empires rise and fall, given the complex web of markets, free trade, currencies, wars, and global politics. With this, you&#8217;ll also understand what&#8217;s happening right now on the world stage, and why China and US relations are rather tense these days.
Whether you want to master how the economy works or get some solid advice for your life and work, you could do far worse than reading Ray Dalio&#8217;s books. All of them are incredibly well-researched, generous, and simple enough to understand despite their complex topics. Start with his most lightweight book, Principles for Success, then climb the ladder from there!
Conclusion
Ray Dalio is one of the richest people in the world today. His writings are helpful, informative, and inspiring. We hope this list will help you pick your favorite and get started!

Embrace Mistakes: Seeing mistakes as opportunities for learning and growth, and using them to improve decision-making.
Principles-Driven Decision Making: Making decisions based on a clear set of principles and adhering to them consistently.
Be Realistic: Recognizing the realities of the world and the markets, even if they don&#8217;t align with personal desires or beliefs.
Evolve and Iterate: Continuously improving and evolving one&#8217;s understanding and strategies based on experience and feedback.

							ChatGPT
							Writer
						ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It was trained on a massive amount of text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts and questions. ChatGPT can understand and respond to natural language, making it a valuable tool for tasks such as language translation, content creation, and customer service. While ChatGPT is not a sentient being and does not possess consciousness, its sophisticated algorithms allow it to generate text that is often indistinguishable from that of a human.

						TOP 35 RAY DALIO QUOTES FOR SUCCESS AND RICHES
										Published 12 months ago on July 5, 2024
										By The STRIVE 									
Ray Dalio is highly successful investor, hedge fund manager, author, and billionaire.  He founded the American investment firm Bridgewater Associates and authored multiple New York Times bestselling books like, &#8216;Principles: Life and Work&#8217;, and &#8216;Principles For Dealing With a Changing World&#8217;. 
Having started from his firm out of his two-bedroom apartment back in 1975, to then losing everything just 7 years later and being so broke he had to borrow $4,000 loan from his father to rebuild; Ray Dalio bounced back from rock-bottom to become a multibillionaire who&#8217;s firm now manages over $123.5 billion in assets. As such, we’re publishing some of the best Ray Dalio quotes to help you peer into a mind that knows how to overcome failure and setbacks, and thrive in a changing world.
So, if you’re ready for some true words of wisdom, then let’s dive into these powerful Ray Dalio quotes:
BEST RAY DALIO QUOTES FOR SUCCESS
1.  &#8220;He who lives by the crystal will eat shattered glass.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
2. “If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing your limits, and if you’re not pushing your limits, you’re not maximizing your potential”  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
3.  &#8220;School typically doesn&#8217;t prepare people for real life &#8212; unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing others.  In my opinion, that&#8217;s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
4.  &#8220;When you think it&#8217;s too hard, remember that in the long run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
5.  &#8220;Mistakes are a path to progress.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
6.  &#8220;Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio

8.  &#8220;Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
9.  &#8220;Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want.  The converse is also true:  idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
10.  &#8220;By and large, life will give you what you deserve.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
11.  &#8220;The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful.  Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
12.  &#8220;If you want to achieve success, make your work and your passion the same thing and don&#8217;t for get about the money part.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
13.  &#8220;When you&#8217;re centered, your emotions are not hijacking you.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio

15.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about looking good &#8212; worry about achieving your goals.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
16.  &#8220;Focus more on making the pie bigger than on exactly how to slice it.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
17. &#8220;More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don&#8217;t is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
18.  &#8220;If you don&#8217;t look back on yourself and think, &#8216;Wow how stupid I was a year ago&#8217;, then you must have not learned much in the last year.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
19.  &#8220;Meditation more than anything in my life was the biggest ingredient of whatever success I&#8217;ve had.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
20.  &#8220;Pain plus reflection equals progress.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
21.  &#8220;If your objective is to be as good as you can be, then you&#8217;re going to want criticism.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio

24.  &#8220;Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
25.   &#8220;Treat your life like a game.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
26.  &#8220;Early in my career, I learned through a couple of painful mistakes that the biggest things that surprised me did so because they never happened in my lifetime but had happened many times in history.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
27.  &#8220;Whatever success I&#8217;ve had has been more due to knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
28.  &#8220;Put things in perspective by going back before going forward.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
29.  &#8220;Anything that requires change can be difficult.  Yet in order to learn and grow and make progress, you must change.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
30.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a basic law of nature:  You must stretch yourself if you want to be strong.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
31.  &#8220;Great managers orchestrate rather than do.  Like the conductor of an orchestra, they do not play an instrument, but direct their people so that they play beautifully together.&#8221;  &#8211;  Ray Dalio
